Very good, Lieutenant. [ Droid Beeping ] [ Grunts ] We made it. [ Man ] I guess I was wrong. There was no danger at all. Cord. Milady, I'm so sorry. I've failed you, Senator. No. Milady, you're still in danger here. - I shouldn't have come back. - This vote is very important. You did your duty. Cord did hers. Now, come. Senator Amidala, please. I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists. - If they do break away-- - I will not let this Republic... that has stood for a thousand years be split in two. My negotiations will not fail. If they do,you must realize there aren't enoughJedi to protect the Republic. We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers. Master Yoda. Do you think it will really come to war? Hmm, the dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is. [ Speaking Huttese ] The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honor. - Good. - [ Huttese ] Send them in. We will discuss this matter later. Senator Amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform-- terrible. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart. Do you have any idea who was behind this attack? Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo. I think that Count Dooku was behind it. He is a political idealist, not a murderer. You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He couldn't assassinate anyone. It's not in his character. But for certain, Senator... in grave danger you are. MasterJedi, may I suggest... the senator be placed... under the protection of your graces. Do you really think that's a wise decision under these stressful times? Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe-- The situation is that serious? No, but I do, Senator. I realize all too well that additional security... might be disruptive for you... but perhaps someone you're familiar with. An old friend, like Master Kenobi. That's possible. He's just returned from a border dispute on Ansion. Do it for me, milady. Please? The thought of losing you... is unbearable. I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady. [ Senator Amidala ] Thank you, Master Windu. You seem a little on edge. - Not at all. - I haven't felt you this tense... since we fell into that nest of gundarks. [ Scoffs ] You fell into that nightmare, Master... and I rescued you, remember? Oh... yes. [ Laughing ] [ Chuckles ] You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath. I haven't seen her in ten years, Master. Obi? Obi! Mesa so smilen to seein yousa! - Good to see you again,JarJar. - Senator Padm. Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator. Desa Jedi arriven. It's a great pleasure to see you again, milady. It has been far too long, Master Kenobi. Ani? My goodness, you've grown. So have you. Grown more beautiful, I mean. Well, f-for a senator, I mean. Ani, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine. Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you. I'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty's security service. Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment. I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit. I don't need more security. I need answers. I want to know who's trying to kill me. We are here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation. We will find out who's trying to kill you, Padm. - I promise you. - We will not exceed our mandate... my young Padawan learner. I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master. We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin... - and you will pay attention to my lead. - Why? What? Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, notJedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate. We will do exactly as the council has instructed. And you will learn your place, young one. Perhaps with merely your presence... the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now, if you'll excuse me... I will retire. I know I'll feel better having you here. I'll have an officer stationed on every floor, and I'll be in the control center downstairs. Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani. She hardly even recognized me,JarJar. I've thought about her every day since we parted, and... she's forgotten me completely. Shesa happy. Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time. You're focusing on the negative, Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was pleased to see us. Now, let's check the security. I hit the ship, but they used a decoy. We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam. My client is getting impatient. Take these. Be careful. They're very poisonous. Zam, there can be no mistakes this time. Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin would try that way. - Any activity up here? - Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her. - [ Beeping ] - What's going on? Ah, she covered the cameras. I don't think she liked me watching her. What is she thinking? She programmed R2 to warn us if there is an intruder. [ Obi-Wan ] There are many other ways to kill a senator. [ Anakin ] I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don't we, Master? You're using her as bait. It was her idea. Don't worry. No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me. It's too risky. Besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice. And yours are? Possibly. You look tired. I don't sleep well anymore. Because of your mother? I don't know why I keep dreaming about her. Dreams pass in time. I'd much rather dream about Padm. Just being around her again is... intoxicating. Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin. They betray you. You've made a commitment to theJedi order, a commitment not easily broken. And don't forget, she's a politician, and they're not to be trusted. [ Anakin ] She's not like the others in the senate, Master. [ Obi-Wan ] It is my experience that senators... focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they're in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy... -in order to get those funds. - Not another lecture. At least not on the economics of politics. [ R2-D2 Beeps ] [ Beeping ] And besides, you're generalizing. - The chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt. - Palpatine is a politician. [ Obi-Wan ] I have observed that he is very clever... in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators. I think he's a good man. My-- I sense it too. [ Gasps ] [ Whirring ] Stay here! Are you all right, milady? Ah! - [ Horn Honking ] - What the-- [ Cursing In Huttese ] Jedi poo doo! - What took you so long? - Oh, you know, Master. - I couldn't find a speeder that I really liked... - There he is. with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities. If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you do your wit... you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman. - I thought I already did. - Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. - Pull up, Anakin. Pull up! - [ Laughing ] - You know I don't like it when you do that. - Sorry, Master. I forgot you don't like flying. I don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide. Anakin! How many times have I told you-- Ah!-- - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! - stay away from power couplings! That was good! Where are you going? He went that way. Master, if we keep this chase going any longer... that creep is gonna end up deep-fried... and, personally, I'd very much like to find out who he is and who he's working for. This is a shortcut. I think. Well, you've lost him. I'm deeply sorry, Master. That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. - Once again you've proved-- - If you'll excuse me. I hate it when he does that. [ Grunting ] - [ Engine Accelerating ] - [ Grunting ] [ Shouting, Grunting ] [ Onlookers Murmuring ] Anakin! - She went into the club, Master. - Patience. Use the Force. Think. - Sorry, Master. - He went in there to hide, not to run. - Yes, Master. - Next time, try not to lose it. - Yes, Master. - This weapon is your life. I try, Master. Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me? Don't say that, Master. You're the closest thing I have to a father. - Then why don't you listen to me? - I am trying. [ Cheering, Shouting ] - Can you see him? - I think he is a she... and I think she is a changeling. In that case, be extra careful. - Go and find her. - Where are you going, Master? For a drink. Thank you. You wanna buy some death sticks? You don't want to sell me death sticks. - I don't want to sell you death sticks. - You want to go home... - and rethink your life. - I want to go home and rethink my life. - [ Patron Shouting In Huttese ] - [ Patrons Laughing ] [ Cheering ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Patrons Gasping ] [ Moaning, Grunting ] Easy.Jedi business. Go back to your drinks. - [ Groaning ] - Do you know who it was you were trying to kill? [ Moans ] It was a senator from Naboo. And who hired you? It was just a job. Who hired you? Tell us. Tell us now! It was a bounty hunter called-- [ Gagging ] Wee shahnit... sleemo. Toxic dart. [ Yoda ] Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan. Most importantly, find out who he's working for. What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting. Handle that your Padawan will. Anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She'll be safer there. And don't use registered transport. Travel as refugees. As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult... to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital. Until caught this killer is... our judgment she must respect. - Hmm. -[ Windu ] Anakin, go to the senate... and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter. I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that. Thank you, Your Excellency. And so, they've finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off. Your guidance more than my patience. You don't need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible. I have said it many times: You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met. Thank you, Your Excellency. I see you becoming the greatest of all theJedi, Anakin... even more powerful than Master Yoda. I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet. [ Yoda ] The council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. [ Windu ] The boy has exceptional skills. But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him, well, arrogant. Yes, yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Hmm. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones. Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true... your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance. [ Padm ] I'm taking an extended leave of absence. It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate. - Representative Binks, I know I can count on you. - Hmm? Mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden. Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and, uh-- JarJar, I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do. Of course. Milady. I do not like this idea of hiding. Don't worry. Now that the council has ordered an investigation... it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter. I haven't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act... to not be here when its fate is decided. Sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us. Anakin, you've grown up. Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. Don't get me wrong. Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and... as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. In some ways-- a lot of ways-- I'm really ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials... but he feels that I'm too unpredictable. He won't let me move on. - That must be frustrating. - It's worse. He's overly critical. He never listens. He-- He doesn't understand. It's not fair! All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow. [ Sighs ] I know. Anakin. Don't try to grow up too fast. But I am grown up. You said it yourself. Please don't look at me like that. - Why not? - It makes me feel uncomfortable. Sorry, milady. - Be safe, milady. - Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorm. The threat's on you two now. He'll be safe with me. - You'll be fine. - It's not me, milady. I worry about you. What if they realize you've left the capital? Well, then myJedi protector will have to prove how good he is. Anakin. Don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council. Yes, Master. I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady. You'll be back here in no time. I'll be most grateful for your speed, MasterJedi. - It's time to go. - I know. Anakin, may the Force be with you. May the Force be with you, Master. Suddenly I'm afraid. This is my first assignment on my own. I am too. Don't worry. We have R2 with us. - [ Laughing ] - [ Beeping ] I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish. I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him. Someone to see ya, honey! Jedi, by the looks of him. - Obi-Wan! - Hello, Dex. Take a seat. I'll be right with ya. - You wanna cup o'jawa juice? - Oh, yes. Thank you. Hey, old buddy! [ Both Laughing ] Ohhh. [ Coughs ] So, my friend, what can I do for ya? You can tell me what this is. Well, whattaya know! I ain't seen one of these since I was prospectin'... on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim. [ Obi-Wan ] Can you tell me where it came from? Thank you. [ Dex ] This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino saberdart. I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archives. It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away. Those analysis droids only focus on symbols. Huh! I should think that you Jedi would have more respect... for the difference between knowledge and... [ Laughing ] wisdom. Well, if droids could think, there'd be none of us here, would there? Kamino. I'm not familiar with it. Is it in the Republic? No, no. It's beyond the outer rim. I'd say about, uh, 1 2 parsecs... outside the Rishi Maze. Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives. [ Chuckles ] These, uh, Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damn good ones too. - Cloners. Are they friendly? - Oh, depends. Depends on what, Dex? On how good your manners are... and how big your, uh... pocketbook is. [ Chuckling ] Hmm. Did you call for assistance? - Yes, yes, I did. - Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi? Yes, um, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino. - Kamino. - It doesn't show up on the archive charts. Kamino. It's not a system I'm familiar with. Are you sure you have the right coordinates? According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the Rishi Maze. [ Beeping ] I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for... doesn't exist. Impossible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete. If an item does not appear in our records... it does not exist. - Hey, you! No droids! - [ Beeping ] - Get outta here! - [ Raspberries ] - [ Beeping ] - Thank you, R2. - [ Chirping ] - Must be difficult, having sworn your life to theJedi... not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like. Or be with the people that I love. Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi. Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love... is central to a Jedi's life. So you might say that we are encouraged to love. - You've changed so much. - Ah, you haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. [ Yoda ] Reach out. Sense the Force around you. Use your feelings you must. Younglings. Younglings! A visitor we have. [ Together] Hello, Master Obi-Wan. Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, Master. What help can I be, Obi-Wan? Hmm? I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps. Mmm. Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. - How embarrassing. -[ Children Giggling ] How embarrassing. Hmm? Liam, the shades. Gather round the map reader. Clear your minds... and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will. It ought to be... here... but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot. Hmm. Gravity's silhouette remains... but the star and all the planets... disappeared they have. How can this be? Hmm? A thought? -[ Yoda ] Anyone. -[ Boy ] Master? Because someone erased it from the archive memory. [ Yoda Chuckles ] Truly wonderful the mind of a child is. [ Chuckling ] The Padawan is right. Go to the center of gravity's pull... and find your planet you will. Hmm. The data must have been erased. But, Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives? That's impossible, isn't it? Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this I will. Hmm. I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected... but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready. The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office. I was relieved when my two terms were up. But when the queen asked me to serve as senator... I couldn't refuse her. I agree with her. I think the Republic needs you. I'm glad that you chose to serve. [ Padm ] If the senate votes to create an army... - I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war. - [ Man ] It's unthinkable. There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic. Do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the Republic? Not if they feel threatened. My guess is they'll turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help. It's outrageous, but after four trials in the Supreme Court... Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis. We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it. Let's pray that day never comes. In the meantime, we must consider your own safety. What is your suggestion, MasterJedi? Oh, Anakin's not a Jedi yet. He's still a Padawan learner. But I was thinking-- - Hold on a minute. - Excuse me. I was thinking I would stay in the lake country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. Excuse me. I'm in charge of security here, milady. And this is my home. I know it very well. That is why we're here. I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance. Sorry, milady. [ Queen Jamillia ] Perfect. It's settled, then. There it is, R4, right where it should be. Our missing planet Kamino. [ Whistling, Beeping ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] MasterJedi. The prime minister is expecting you. - I'm expected? - Of course. He is anxious to meet you. After all these years... we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now, please, this way. May I present Lama Su... prime minister of Kamino. And this is MasterJedi-- Obi-Wan Kenobi. I trust you're going to enjoy your stay. Please. And now to business. You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule. are ready... with a million more well on the way. That's good news. Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas... that his order will be met on time. I'm sorry. Master-- Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of theJedi Council... is he not? Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him. - The army? - Yes. A clone army, and I must say, one of the finest we've ever created. Tell me, Prime Minister... when my master first contacted you about the army... did-- did he say who it was for? Of course he did. This army is for the Republic. But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself. That's why I'm here. We used to come here for school retreat. We would swim to that island every day. I love the water. We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing. I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here, everything is soft... and smooth. No. [ Gasps ] I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. - Very impressive. - I'd hoped you would be pleased. [ Lama Su ] Clones can think creatively. You will find that they are immensely superior to droids. We take great pride in our combat education and training programs. This group was created about five years ago. [ Obi-Wan ] You mentioned growth acceleration. [ Lama Su ] Oh,yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now we can do it in half the time. [ Obi-Wan ] I see. [ Lama Su ] They are totally obedient... taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure... to make them less independent than the original host. And who was the original host? A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. And where is this bounty hunter now? Oh, we keep him here. [ Lama Su ] Apart from his pay, which is considerable... Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself. - Curious, isn't it? - ''Unaltered''? [ Lama Su ] Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration. I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett. I would be very happy to arrange it for you. Magnificent, aren't they? - I don't know. - [ Chuckles ] Sure you do. You just don't want to tell me. You gonna use one of yourJedi mind tricks on me? They only work on the weak-minded. All right. I was 1 2. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older than I. Very cute. Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes. All right, I get the picture. Whatever happened to him? I went into public service; he went on to become an artist. - Maybe he was the smart one. - You really don't like politicians, do you? I like two or three... but I'm not really sure about one of them. [ Both Chuckle ] I don't think the system works. How would you have it work? We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem... agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it. That's exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't always agree. Well, then they should be made to. - By whom? Who's gonna make them? You? - I don't know. Someone. - Of course not me. - But someone. Someone wise. Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me. Well, if it works. - You're making fun of me. - No. I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator. [ Creature Bellowing ] [ Anakin ] Whoa, whoa! [ Laughing ] - [ Bellowing ] - Oh, whoa! [ Grunting ] - [ Lowing ] - [ Grunts, Groans ] Ani! Ani, are you all right? [ Laughing ] [ Both Laughing ] [ Beeping ] Boba, is your father here? Boba, is your father here? Yep. May we see him? Sure. Dad, Taun We's here. [ Thunder Rumbling ] Jango, welcome back. Was your trip productive? Fairly. This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress. Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud. I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe. Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant? - Once or twice. - Recently? Possibly. Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas. Uh, Boba, rood eht so-heeck. Master who? [ Obi-Wan ] Sifo-Dyas. Is he not theJedi who hired you for this job? Never heard of him. Really? I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden. Curious. Do you like your army? I look forward to seeing them in action. They'll do their job well. I'll guarantee that. Thank you for your time,Jango. Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi. [ Thunder Rumbling ] What is it, Dad? Pack your things. We're leaving. And when I got to them, we went into aggressive negotiations. Thank you. ''Aggressive negotiations''? What's that? Uh, well, negotiations with a lightsaber. - [ Laughing ] Oh. - [ Laughing ] If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy. From the moment I met you... all those years ago... not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you-- I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul... tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything that you ask. If you are suffering as much as I am, please, tell me. I can't. We can't. It's...just not possible. Anything is possible, Padm. Listen to me. No, you listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi. I'm-- I'm a senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion... it'll take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other. Then you do feel something. I will not let you give up your future for me. You are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings... but I can't. I will not give in to this. Well, you know, it... wouldn't have to be that way. We could keep it a secret. We'd be living a lie... one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that? No. You're right. It would destroy us. Tell your council that the first battalions are ready. And remind them, if they need more troops... it will take more time to grow them. - I won't forget, and thank you. - Thank you. - R4! - [ Beeping ] Scramble code five to Coruscant, care of the old folks' home! [ Beeping ] I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter... is the assassin we are looking for. Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala? No, Master. There appears to be no motive. [ Yoda ] Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be... if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot. Yes, Master. They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army... at the request of the senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army? No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of theJedi Council. Bring him here. Question him we will. Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him. Blind we are if creation of this clone army... we could not see. [ Sighs ] I think it is time we informed the senate... that our ability to use the Force has diminished. Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the senate is... multiply our adversaries will. No. No. Mom, no. Don't. No. No. Don't go. I don't want to disturb you. Your presence is soothing. You had another nightmare last night. Jedi don't have nightmares. I heard you. I saw my mother. She is suffering, Padm. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. [ Deep Sigh ] She is in pain. I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator... but I have to go. I have to help her. I'll go with you. I'm sorry. I don't have a choice. [ Thunder Rumbling ] Dad, look! Boba, get on board! - [Jango Shouts ] - Oh, not good. [ Grunts ] [ Driver Speaking Huttese ] - Wait right there. - Okey-okey. Da wanga! Chut-chut, Watto. [ Speaking Huttese ] Let me help you with that. What? What do you want? Wait! You're a Jedi! [ Grunts ] Whatever it is, I didn't do it. Ai! [ Grunts, Sighs ] I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker. - [ Fly Buzzing ] - Ani? Little Ani? Nahhh. You are Ani! It is you! [ Laughing ] You sure sprouted, huh? Wee-hoo! AJedi! Whattaya know! [ Chuckles ] Hey... maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money. My mother. Oh, yeah. Shmi. Uh... she's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her. - You sold her? - Years ago. Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business, huh? [ Chuckles ] Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer named, uh, Lars. At least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her! Can ya beat that, eh? [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Do you know where they are now? Ooh, long way from here. Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think, mmm. I'd like to know. Eh, sure. Absolutely! [ Chuckles ] Let's go look at my records, huh? [ Chuckles ] Mmm. - [ Beeping ] - Dad! I think we're being tracked! [Jango ] He must have put a homing device on our hull. Hang on, son. We'll move into the asteroid field... and we'll have a couple of surprises for him. [ Cackling ] [ Beeping ] Seismic charges! Stand by. [ Beeping ] He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy. Watch out! - [ Rapid Beeping ] - Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire! Oh, blast! This is why I hate flying! - We got him! - We'll just have to finish him. - R4, prepare to jettison the spare part canisters. - [ Beeping ] - Fire them now! - [ Beeping ] - Well, we won't be seeing him again. - [ Chuckles ] - Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough. - [ Beeping ] There's an unusual concentration of Federation ships over there, R4. [ R4 Beeps ] [ Beeping ] - [ R2-D2 Whistles, Beeps ] - [ Padm ] Stay with the ship, R2. [ Beeping ] Oh! Um, uh, hello. How might I be of service? I am C-- - 3PO? - Oh, um-- The maker! Oh, Master Ani! I knew you would return. I knew it! And Miss Padm. Oh, my. Hello, 3PO. Bless my circuits! I'm so pleased to see you both. I've come to see my mother. Oh. Um, I think perhaps we'd better go indoors. Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors. I'm Anakin Skywalker. Owen Lars. Uh, this is my girlfriend, Beru. - Hello. - I'm Padm. I guess I'm your stepbrother. I had a feeling you might show up someday. - Is my mother here? - No, she's not. Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife. We should go inside. We have a lot to talk about. [ Cliegg ] It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusken Raiders. Your mother had gone out early, like she always did... to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators. From the tracks, she was about halfway home... when they took her. [ Sighs ] Those Tuskens walk like men... but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. I'd be out there with them, but after I lost my leg... I just couldn't ride anymore un-until I heal. I don't want to give up on her... but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long. Where are you going? To find my mother. Your mother's dead, son. Accept it. You're gonna have to stay here. These are good people, Padm. You'll be safe. Anakin-- I won't be long. [ Machinery Clanging ] [ Man #1 ] We must persuade the Commerce Guild... and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty. What about the senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet? I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk. [ Man #1 ] I am a man of my word, Viceroy. [ Alien ] With these new battle droids we've built for you... you'll have the finest army in the galaxy. [ Man #1 ] As I explained to you earlier... I am quite convinced that 1 0,000 more systems... will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen. [ Speaking In Alien Language ] What you are proposing could be construed as treason. The Techno Union army... [ Electronic Warbling ] is at your disposal, Count. The Banking Clan will sign your treaty. [ Man #1 ] Good. Very good. Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support... and when their battle droids are combined with yours... we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy. TheJedi will be overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make. [ Growling ] [ Snarling ] [ Growling, Snarling Continue ] [ Growling ] [ Moaning ] Mom. Mom? Mom? Ani? Ani? Is it you? I'm here, Mom. You're safe. Ani? Ani? Oh, you look so handsome. My son. Oh, my grown-up son. I'm so proud of you, Ani. I missed you. Now I am complete. I love y-- Stay with me, Mom. Everything-- I love-- I-- I love-- [ Groaning ] [ Shouting ] [ Screaming ] [ Qui-GonJinn's Voice ] Anakin! Anakin! No-o-o! What is it? Pain, suffering... death I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain. The transmitter is working, but we're not receiving a return signal. Coruscant's too far. R4, can you boost the power? - [ Beeping ] - We'll have to try something else. [ Beeping ] Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo. It's much closer. Anakin? Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin? He's not on Naboo, R4. [ Beeping ] I'm going to try and widen the range. I do hope nothing's happened to him. That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right... but it's coming from Tatooine. What in the blazes is he doing there? I told him to stay on Naboo. [ Beeping ] We haven't got much time. Anakin? Anakin, do you copy? - This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. - [ Creature Screeching ] [ Static, Obi-Wan's Voice Breaks Up ] Retransmit this message-- [ Garbled Audio ] Anakin, do you copy? Anakin-- My long-range-- [ Static ] has been knocked out. - Retransmit this message to Coruscant. - [ Beeping ] I brought you something. Are you hungry? The shifter broke. Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things. I'm good at fixing things. Always was. But I couldn't-- Why'd she have to die? Why couldn't I save her? I know I could have! Sometimes there are things no one can fix. - You're not all-powerful, Ani. - Well, I should be! Someday I will be. I will be the most powerfulJedi ever! I promise you. I will even learn to stop people from dying. Anakin. It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous! He's holding me back! He's jealous! He's holding me back! - [ Object Clattering ] - [ Sniffling ] What's wrong, Ani? I-- I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead. Every single one of them. And not just the men... but the women... and the children too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals! I hate them! [ Anakin Exhales ] To be angry is to be human. I'm a Jedi. I know I'm better than this. [ Cliegg ] I know wherever you are it's become a better place. You were the most loving partner a man could ever have. Good-bye, my darling wife. And thank you. I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom. I wasn't strong enough. But I promise I won't fail again. I miss you... so much. [ Beeping ] R2? What are you doing here? [ Beeping ] It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hmm. Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you? [ Beeping ] Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant. I have tracked the bounty hunter, Jango Fett... to the droid foundries on Geonosis. The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here... and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray... is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala. The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance... have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming a-- Wait. Wait. - [ Lightsaber Whooshing ] - [ Obi-Wan Grunting ] More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed. I agree. Anakin, we will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you is to stay where you are. Protect the senator at all costs. That is your first priority. Understood, Master. They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look. Geonosis is less than a parsec away. If he's still alive. Ani, are you just gonna sit here and let him die? - He's your friend, your mentor. He's-- - He's like my father! But you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here! He gave you strict orders to protect me... and I'm going to help Obi-Wan. - If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along. - [ Engines Power Up ] I'm not worried, R2. It's just I've never flown before. The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that. [ Palpatine ] Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them. [ Speaking In Alien Language ] The debate is over. Now we need that clone army. Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The senate will never approve the use of clones before the separatists attack. This is a crisis. The senate must vote the chancellor emergency powers. He can then approve the creation of an army. But what senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment? If only... Senator Amidala were here. Mm. [ Screeching ] [ Grumbling ] Traitor. Oh, no, my friend. This is a mistake, a terrible mistake. They have gone too far. This is madness. I thought you were the leader here, Dooku. This had nothing to do with me, I assure you. I will petition immediately to have you set free. Well, I hope it doesn't take too long. I have work to do. May I ask why a Jedi knight... is all the way out here on Geonosis? I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Do you know him? There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of. The Geonosians don't trust them. Who can blame them? But he is here, I can assure you. It's a great pity that our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you. I wish he were still alive. I could use his help right now. Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you. Don't be so sure, my young Jedi. You forget that he was once my apprentice... just as you were once his. He knew all about the corruption in the senate... but he would never have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as I have. - The truth? - The truth. What if I told you that the Republic... was now under the control of the dark lord of the Sith? No, that's not possible. TheJedi would be aware of it. The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend. Hundreds of senators are now under the influence... of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious. I don't believe you. The viceroy of the Trade Federation... was once in league with this Darth Sidious... but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord. He came to me for help. He told me everything. You must join me, Obi-Wan... and together we will destroy the Sith! I will never join you, Dooku. It may be difficult to secure your release. [JarJar ] It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact... wesa desa Federation du Trade. Senators, ''dellow felagates''.: In response to this direct threat to the Republic... mesa propose that the senate... give immediately emergency powers... to the supreme chancellor. [ Shouts Of Approval ] Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine! [ Shouting In Alien Language ] [ Senate Chairman ] Order! We shall have order! It is with great reluctance... that I have agreed to this calling. - I love democracy. I love the Republic. - [ Applause ] The power you give me... I will lay down when this crisis has abated. [ Cheering, Applause ] And as my first act with this new authority... I will create a grand army of the Republic... to counter the increasing threats of the separatists. It is done, then. Hmm. I will take whatJedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan. Visit I will the cloners on Kamino, hmm... and see this army they have created for the Republic. See those columns of steam straight ahead? They're exhaust vents of some type. That'll do. Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead. I'm not interested in getting into a war here. As a member of the senate... maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess. Don't worry. I've given up trying to argue with you. [ Whistling, Beeping ] My obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help... they would have asked for it, hmm? You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behavior. [ Beeping ] - [ Beeping ] - For a mechanic... you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking. - [ Beeping ] - I am programmed to understand humans! [ Beeping ] ''What does that mean?'' Oh! - That means I am in charge here! - [ Raspberries ] Where are you going now? You don't know what's out there. Have you no sense at all? Oh! Idiot! - Please wait. - [ Beeping ] Do you know where you're going? Wait. [ Squawking ] Oh, my-- Oh, oh, oh! - [ Screaming ] - Padm! Ah! [ Grunts ] Oh, my goodness! Shut me down! Machines making machines. Huh! How perverse. [ Grunts ] Oh! Calm down, R2. I almost fell. You'll get your chance-- Oh! I'm scrap. [ Grunting ] It's a nightmare! Oh, I want to go home! Ahh! Oh, what did I do to deserve this? [ Beeping ] [ Whistling ] - [ Padm Grunting ] - [ Geonosian Screeching ] Ahhh! - [ Whistling ] - Hmm. I wonder what happened to poor little R2. He's always getting himself into trouble. Oops. Oh, no! Uh-oh. Oh! Oh, I'm so confused. Oh, not again. Obi-Wan's gonna kill me. Don't move,Jedi! Take him away. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life. What are you talking about? I love you. You love me? I thought that we had decided not to fall in love... that we would be forced to live a lie... and that it would destroy our lives. I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. I truly... deeply love you... and before we die, I want you to know. Eeyah! [ Loud Cheering ] [ Cheering ] I was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message. I retransmitted it just as you had requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you. Good job. [ Cheering ] [ Speaking In Geonosian ] Settle down. Settle down. [ Cheering Subsides ] [ Speaking In Geonosian ] Let the executions begin. [ Cheering ] [ Roaring ] [ Screeching ] [ Roaring ] [ Roaring ] I've got a bad feeling about this. - [ Shouting ] - [ Bellowing ] [ Creatures Roaring ] [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Snarling ] -Just relax. Concentrate. - What about Padm? She seems to be on top of things. [ Roaring ] [ Bellowing ] [ Roaring ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Snarling ] [ Chuckling ] [ Yelling ] [ Creature Yelps ] She can't do that! Shoot her or-- or something! [ Whimpering, Snarling ] - [ Shrieking ] - [ Roaring ] [ Hissing, Growling ] [ Screaming ] [ Subdued Growling ] - Whoa! Yah! - [ Growling, Roaring ] Hyah! Hyah! [ Cheering ] - [ Snarling ] - [ Bellowing ] Jump! Hyah! Hyah! [ Shrieking ] - [ Cheering ] - [ Shouting ] This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango! Finish her off!. Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die. Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. This party's over. Brave but, uh, foolish, my old Jedi friend. - You're impossibly outnumbered. - [ Scoffs ] I don't think so. - We'll see. - [ Heavy Footsteps Approaching ] [ Synthesized Voice ] My legs aren't moving. I must need maintenance. [ C-3PO ] What's all this noise? A-A battle! Oh, there's been some terrible mistake! I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction! - [ Roaring ] - [ Obi-Wan Grunts ] [ Roaring ] [ Groaning, Yelling ] [ Yowling ] Die,Jedi dogs! Oh! What did I say? Hah! Oh, dear. I'm terribly sorry about all this. Ohh! Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up. You call this a diplomatic solution? No, I call it aggressive negotiations. - Uh-oh. - Roger, roger. [ Growling, Screeching ] [ Creature Shrieking ] - [ Beeping ] - R2, what are you doing here? [ Beeping ] What are you doing? Oh, stop that! You're going to strain something. My neck! - Now where are you taking me? Oh, this is such a drag. - [ Beeping ] [ C-3PO ] Oh, I'm quite beside myself. R2, please be careful! You're singeing my circuits! - [ Beeping ] - Yes, but is my head on straight? [ Dooku ] Master Windu, you have fought gallantly... worthy of recognition in the archives of theJedi order. Now it is finished. Surrender, and your lives will be spared. We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku! Then, I'm sorry, old friend. Look! Look! Around the survivors a perimeter create. [ Beeping, Chirping ] Oh, I've had the most peculiar dream. If Dooku escapes... rally more systems to his cause he will. Hold on! Aim right above the fuel cells! Good call, my young Padawan. [ Viceroy Gunray ] TheJedi have amassed a huge army. That doesn't seem possible. How could theJedi come up with an army so quickly? We must send all available droids into battle. There are too many. [ Speaking In Geonosian ] Our communications have been jammed. - Pilot, land in that assembly area! - Yes, sir. Sir, I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir. To the forward command center take me. Attack those Federation starships! Quickly! Master Yoda, all forward positions are advancing. Very good. Very good. [ Viceroy Gunray ] This is not looking good at all! We must get the starships back into space. [ Speaking In Geonosian ] We have to order a retreat. My master will never allow the Republic... to get away with this treachery. [ Speaking In Geonosian ] I'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs. TheJedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon. If they find out what we are planning to build, we're doomed. [ Geonosian ] I will take the designs with me to Coruscant. They will be much safer there with my master. [ Alarm Blaring ] Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship. Yes, sir. Move all quadrants to sector 5-1 -5. Look over there! It's Dooku! Shoot him down! We're out of rockets, sir. - Follow him! - We're gonna need some help! There isn't time! Anakin and I can handle this! [ Beeping ] - [ Padm Yells ] - [ Anakin ] Padm! - Put the ship down! - Anakin! Don't let your personal feelings get in the way! Follow that speeder! - Lower the ship! - I can't take Dooku alone! I need you! If we catch him, we can end this war right now! - We have a job to do! - I don't care! Put the ship down! You will be expelled from theJedi order! - I can't leave her! - Come to your senses! What do you think Padm would do were she in your position? She would do her duty. Hmm. The droid army is in full retreat. Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship. [ Anakin ] You're gonna pay for all theJedi that you killed today, Dooku. - We'll take him together. Go in slowly on the left. - I'm taking him now! No, Anakin! No! No! [ Anakin Screams ] As you see, myJedi powers are far beyond yours. Now... back down. I don't think so. Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. Surely you can do better. [ Moaning ] [ Groaning ] Are you all right? Uh-huh. - We'd better get back to the forward command center. - No. No. Gather what troops you can. We've got to get to that hangar. - Get a transport. Hurry! - Right away. [ Moaning ] Ah! Ahh! [ Anakin Shouts ] Brave of you, boy. But I would have thought you had learned your lesson. - I am a slow learner. - Anakin! [ Grunting ] - Master Yoda. - Count Dooku. You have interfered with our affairs for the last time. [ Growling ] Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you. I've become more powerful than anyJedi. Even you. Much to learn you still have. It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force... but by our skills with a lightsaber. [ Yelling ] Fought well you have, my old Padawan. This is just the beginning. [ Speaking In Droid Language ] [ Panting, Moaning ] [ Sighing ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Obi-Wan Groans ] [ Padm ] Anakin! The Force is with us, Master Sidious. Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well. I have good news for you, my lord. - The war has begun. - Excellent. Everything is going as planned. [ Obi-Wan ] Do you believe what Count Dooku said... about Sidious controlling the senate? It doesn't feel right. Joined the dark side Dooku has. Mmm. Lies, deceit... creating mistrust are his ways now. [ Windu ] Nevertheless, I feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate. I agree. Where is your apprentice? On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home. I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory. [ Yoda ] Victory? Victory, you say? Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun the Clone War has.\n                    "}, "Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)": {"transcript": "\n\n                        ...breaking a whole unit Fire at will. Squad 2, pick your target. There's too many, Captain! Watch your stabilizer, Gold 6 Anybody, cover me I've got two vultures on my tail. - We gotta hold them here - Watch your left! - I can't shake them! I'm hit! I'm hit! - Where's our reinforcements? A galaxy divided! Striking swiftly after the Battle of Geonosis... Count Dooku's droid army has seized control of the major hyperspace lanes... ...separating the Republic from the majority of its clone army. With few clones available... ...the Jedi generals cannot gain a foothold in the Outer Rim. ...as more and more planets choose to join Dooku's Separatists. While the Jedi are occupied fighting a war, no one is left to keep the peace. Chaos and crime spread... ...and the innocent become victims in a lawless galaxy. Crime lord Jabba the Hutt's son has been kidnapped by a rival band of pirates. Desperate to save his son, Jabba puts out a call for help. A call the Jedi are cautious to answer. Jabba requests that anyone who can help us find his kidnapped son. ...send any information they have immediately. We must help Jabba. This is the opportunity we've been looking for. The Jedi must rescue Jabba's son. I don't like it, dealing with that criminal scum. This is a dark day for the Republic. I agree, my friend, but what choice do we have? The Hutts control the Outer Rim... ...and we'll need their space lanes in order to move our troops. There is more to this kidnapping than it seems. Then you must send as many Jedi as you can. Impossible, Chancellor. The droid General Grievous has our forces spread thin. The only Jedi we can spare are Skywalker and Kenobi. They just captured the planet Christophsis. Then contact them immediately. We need to make contact with General Kenobi. We've been unable to reach him. It could be a solar storm... ...or they're rebooting their communication system. I'm sure the blackout is temporary. A messenger, we are sending, with important orders for General Kenobi. See to it that she gets there as fast as possible. Yes, sir. As soon as we load relief supplies. No time, there is Immediately, the messenger must go. I understand, sir. I will personally take an unloaded ship to drop her off... ...then return to pick up my reinforcements. Go, go, go, go, go! They're back! I told you this victory was too easy. We never should have sent the ship back for supplies. It wasn't my idea to send the ship back. All right, men. Second wave incoming. Rex, you and your men follow me. Cody, battle positions! Up to the front! Incoming! Skywalker should have attacked by now. Don't worry! He knows the plan! What's our plan of attack, sir? Follow me. Come on, then! - Right on! - Give it to them! That's the stuff! Come on you traitors! - Target. - Careful, lads. There, on the right! We're gonna need reinforcements. We haven't been able to get through to the Admiral. - Why are we stopping? - We cannot get past their cannons, sir. Cannons? This will never do. We must pull back and set up our deflector shields. Turn the troops around! Retreat! Retreat! Roger, roger. Roger, roger. They're pulling back. Looks like help has arrived. Our cruiser must be back. Which means we'll be able to get our reinforcements. Then it looks like our problems are solved. Fresh troops, new supplies... ...and perhaps they brought my new Padawan with them. You really think it's a good idea to bring a Padawan learner into all this? I spoke to Master Yoda about it. You should put in a request for one. You'd make a good teacher. No, thanks. Anakin, teaching is a privilege. And it's part of a Jedi's responsibility to help train the next generation. A Padawan would just slow me down. A youngling? And who are you supposed to be? I'm Ahsoka. Master Yoda sent me. I was told to tell both of you. ...that you must get back to the Jedi Temple immediately. - There's an emergency. - Well, I don't know if you've noticed... ...but we're in a bit of an emergency right here. Yes, our communications have been a bit unreliable... ...but we've been calling for help. Master Yoda hadn't heard from you so he sent me to deliver the message. Oh, great. They don't even know we're in trouble. Maybe you can relay a signal through the cruiser that just dropped me off. We need to go back and pick up our reinforcements. We've got to get out of here! We're under attack by Separatist warships... ...but I'll try to make contact with the Jedi Temple for you. Stand by. Master Kenobi, glad Ahsoka found you, I am. Master Yoda, we are trapped here, and vastly outnumbered. We are in no position to go anywhere or do anything. Our support ships have all been destroyed. Send reinforcements to you, we will. Master Yoda? Master Yoda? We've lost the transmission, sir. We have to leave orbit immediately. More enemy ships have just arrived. We'll get back to you as soon as we can. Well, I guess we'll have to hold out a little longer. My apologies, young one. It's time for a proper introduction. I'm the new Padawan learner. I'm Ahsoka Tano. I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi, your new master. I'm at your service, Master Kenobi... ...but I'm afraid I've actually been assigned to Master Skywalker. What? No, no, no. There must be some mistake. He's the one who wanted the Padawan. No, Master Yoda was very specific. I'm assigned to Anakin Skywalker, and he is to supervise my Jedi training. - But that doesn't make any sense. - We'll have to sort this out later. It won't be long before those droids figure out a way around our cannons. I'll check on Rex in the lookout post. You'd better take her with you. I have brought Jabba's son to the abandoned monastery. He will be safe here. Good, good. Everything is going as planned. Yes, my lord. Soon the Jedi will not only be at war with you, Count... ...but the Hutt clan as well. What's the status, Rex? Quiet for now, sir. They're gearing up for another assault. Who's the youngling? I'm Master Skywalker's Padawan. The name's Ahsoka Tano. Sir, I thought you said you'd never have a Padawan. There's been a mix-up. The youngling isn't with me. Stop calling me that! You're stuck with me, Skyguy. What did you just call me? Don't get snippy with me, little one. You know, I don't even think you're old enough to be a Padawan. Well, maybe I'm not, but Master Yoda thinks I am. Well, you're not with Master Yoda now. So, if you're ready, you better start proving it. Captain Rex will show you how a little respect can go a long way. Right. - Come on, youngling. - Padawan. Have you thought about moving that line back, Captain? They'd have better cover that way. Thanks for the suggestion... ...but General Skywalker thinks they're fine where they are. So, if you're a captain and I'm a Jedi... ...then, technically, I outrank you, right? In my book, experience outranks everything. Well, if experience outranks everything, I guess I better start getting some. What's that? Not good. They've got an energy shield. That's gonna make things damn near impossible. If you wanted experience, little one... ...it looks like you're about to get plenty. What is it? The clones are pulling back... ...and the lead tanks are now approaching the city center. Get to those heavy cannons as quickly as you can! The shield generator is somewhere in this area. They're slowly increasing the diameter, and keeping it just ahead of their troops. Heavy cannons are gonna be useless against that. As they get closer, I suppose we could try to draw them into the buildings. That might level the playing field a bit. If that shield's gonna be such a problem, why don't we just take it out? - Easier said than done. - Well, I, for one, agree with her. Someone has to get to that shield generator and destroy it. That's the key. Right, then. Maybe you two can tiptoe through the enemy lines. ...and solve this particular problem together. - Can do, Master Kenobi. - I'll decide what we do. If Rex and I can engage them here... ...you two might have a chance to get through their lines undetected, here. They won't have much time. The droids far outnumber us... ...so our ability to street fight is limited without the use of heavy cannons. They will march forward under the protection of their shield. ...until they are right on top of our cannons, then they'll blow them away. We'll figure out a way. Come on, Master, let's go. If we survive this, Snips, you and I are gonna have a talk. They make quite a pair, don't they, sir? You think they have a chance? They better. If they can't turn off that shield generator before it reaches the heavy cannons... ...there'll be no escape for any of us. What's the status? It looks like those bounty hunters went up there. Contact General Windu. Tell him we found the Hutt. Yes, Commander? We've discovered that Jabba the Hutt. ...has also hired bounty hunters to track down his son... ...and we followed them to a monastery on planet Teth. We feel it's where Jabba's son is being held... ...but it's too heavily fortified for us to do anything alone, sir. Commander, stay out of sight and await further orders. Will do, General. Unusual, it is, a problem Obi-Wan has, subduing the droid army. I'll take care of it. Get me Admiral Wurtz. I need three of his star cruisers. Yes, General. Greater than we think, this mystery may be. Go with the fleet to aid Master Kenobi, I will. So, what's the plan? I thought you were the one with the plan. No, I'm the one with enthusiasm. You're the one with the experience, which I'm looking forward to learning from. Well, first, we need to get behind that shield, then get past their tank lines. Why don't we just go around? Outflank them? - That'd take too long. - Sneak through the middle, then? Impossible. Unless you can turn yourself into a droid. All right. You win. My first lesson will be to wait while you come up with the answer. Well, the wait's over. I've got a plan. That shield is certainly putting a crimp in my day. It's no use, sir! Even at full power the cannon doesn't affect it. All right, Rex. It was worth a try. Tell the men to fall back! This is a stupid plan! We should fight these guys, instead of just sneaking around. Except for the fact that their deflective energy shield just passed over us. If you can't cross their lines, let their lines cross you. If you say so. We're inside the shield. Just stay away from those tanks. A Jedi? - Where's the General? - I don't know, sir! Fall back! I think we made it past all of them, Master. We may pull this off yet. We still have a ways to go before we get to the generator station. Do we still need this thing? I can't take it anymore. I have to stand up. You have got to be careful! You never know what you're gonna run into. See what I mean? - We can't beat its shield. - Run! - What? Jedi don't run! - I said, run! - Ahsoka, stop! - Make up your mind! I said, stop! Good. You take direction well. They're right behind us, sir! They wiped out most of my unit. We had to pull out of there. The shield has almost reached the heavy cannons. We're not gonna be able to stop them, sir. Move your troops back to the heavy cannons. Do everything you can to protect them. I'll delay the droids. - But... - That is an order, Captain! There it is. Come on. You must be the infamous General Kenobi. I surrender. Now, Master Kenobi, order your troops to stand down. General, have a seat. Have you gone mad? I've conceded the battle. Now we simply have to negotiate the terms of surrender. Don't try any of your tricks, Jedi. Surely there's no reason we can't be civilized about this. 'Tis a rare honor to be able to meet one's opponent face-to-face. You're a legend throughout the Inner Core. Thank you. The honor is all mine. I'm so glad you decided to surrender. Well, at some point, one must accept the reality of the situation. Might we have some refreshments? You! Bring us something liquid. Thank you. This shouldn't take long. We are approaching Christophsis, sir. The Separatist blockade is holding position. Deploy the fleet. Have the cruisers protect the transports. Yes, sir. Admiral, hurry, we must, if we are to aid General Kenobi. It will not be easy to breach the blockade, Master Yoda. It's what stopped our relief ships before. Last time, not as many ships did you have. Get past it, we must. Get past it, we will. Stay close. We've gotta be careful. - Come on! - Wait! Why? We're almost there. It's right... I said, wait! Forget about the droids! Set those charges! Sorry! Whose side are you on, anyway? Setting the charges. Sir! General Kenobi's been captured! There's no one else left. We've got to hold out! We can't let that shield reach the cannons. Keep fighting! I could use a little help! Skyguy, don't move! What? No, no, no! - You could have gotten me killed! - I know what I'm doing. - I had everything under control. - I just saved your life. There's too many of them! Fall back, fall back! Man down! Medic! We need a medic here! And, of course, once you've taken custody of my troops... ...arrangements will need to be made for their food and shelter. - Tell me, do you have enough supplies... - Enough of this! You are stalling! Nonsense. General, there are numerous details to be discussed. Seize him! Unless you call off your troops right now, I will have no choice but to destroy you. Truthfully, I was hoping your shield would be knocked out by now. - Did you get the charges set? - Yes. Then what are you waiting for? Uh-oh. Oh, well. Don't fire! Something appears to have happened to your shield, General. All cannons, fire on those tanks! What happened to the shield? General Kenobi, if you can hear me, we're through the blockade. The Separatist armada is in retreat. Your reinforcements should be landing in a moment. Your timing is perfect, Master Yoda. You're reckless, little one. You never would have made it as Obi-Wan's Padawan. But you might make it as mine. Come on. Great job, General Skywalker. You, too, kid. - Thanks for the ride, Rex. - Anytime, sir. Master Obi-Wan. Master Yoda. Trouble, you have, with your new Padawan, I hear. I was explaining the situation to Master Yoda. Really? If not ready for a Padawan, you are, then perhaps, Obi-Wan, we can... No, wait a minute. I admit Ahsoka is a little rough around the edges. But with a great deal of training, and patience... ...she might amount to something. Then go with you, she will, to the Teth system. Teth? That's Wild Space. The droid army isn't even in that sector. Kidnapped, Jabba the Hutt's son has been. You want me to rescue Jabba's son? Anakin, we'll need the Hutts' allegiance to give us an advantage over Dooku. Negotiate the treaty with Jabba, Obi-Wan will. Find the renegades that hold Jabba's son, your mission will be, Skywalker. Come on, Master, it doesn't sound that hard. I'll find Rex and get the troops organized. Don't worry, Anakin. Just teach her everything I taught you and she'll turn out fine. You know, something makes me think this was your idea from the start. Let's just hope Anakin is ready for this responsibility. Ready, he is, to teach an apprentice. To let go of his pupil, a greater challenge it will be. Master this, Skywalker must. If I've got to make a deal with Jabba the Hutt... I'd best be on my way. Jabba, the bounty hunters you sent out to find your son have returned. Contact the Supreme Chancellor immediately. The all-powerful Jabba demands to know why the Jedi are not looking for his son. Mighty Jabba, rest assured, the Jedi are on their way. They better be if you want the Republic. ...to have safe passage through Jabba's territory. Lieutenant, did the kidnappers see you? No, sir. We're the best scouts in the regiment. What about the bounty hunters? Are they still down there? I don't think so. We haven't seen them in a while. Well, what are we up against? Looks like at least two droid battalions protecting a monastery. It's heavily fortified, sir, you won't be able to land there. Good work. Get some rest. That sounds like a lot, even for a Jedi. I heard you were surrounded by droids. How did you ever get the shield down? Okay, so there's a wall behind him with a hole in the middle... ...so I pull the wall down on top of the droids, destroying them. ...and saving the General. - Is that true, sir? - Well, most of it. All right, men, we still got a job to do. - Yes, sir. You heard the General, move it! - All right, back to business. Would this be a good time to teach you that a Jedi is humble, my young Padawan? Sorry, just trying to keep the boys inspired, is all. Don't worry, I'm sure Jabba's in a good mood. We should not keep the wise and powerful Jabba waiting. I wouldn't dream of it. Mighty Jabba, one of our most powerful Jedi is on his way to rescue your son. We will not let you down. The most gracious Jabba has one more small condition. He demands you bring back the slime who kidnapped his little punky muffin. \"Punky\"? Dead or alive. If you do not succeed, Count Dooku and his droid army will. All right, Anakin, here's the story. Jabba has given us only one planetary rotation. ...to get his son back home to Tatooine safe and sound. Won't take us that long, Master. Well, take extreme care We have no idea who's holding Jabba's son. When I've finished negotiations with him, I will join you. There's something coming. I can't make out what it is. I don't like it. Prepare to attack. What if it's one of ours? - Shut up, Sergeant. I'm in command here! - Roger, roger. - Stay close to me, if you can. - It won't be a problem, Master. - This isn't practice, Ahsoka. - I know, and I'll try not to get you killed. Good shot, boy! Sir! We're taking heavy fire! Close the blast shields, Lieutenant! Get us under those guns! Yes, sir. Here we go. - Ridge, your com's gone static. - Got it. Red light. Stand by. Welcome to paradise, rockjumpers. Green light! Go, go, go! Move it! Move it! Watch it! Watch it! Hurry! Go, go, go! Concentrate fire on Sector 11374265! Just fire right there! Follow me! I can't see them. Where'd they go? Oh, my God! Get back here, Sergeant. - So, this is where the fun begins. - Race you to the top. - I'll give you a head start. - Your mistake. Ascension cables! I'm right behind you, Master! Target those walkers! Gotta keep up! Hey! No fair! Rex, follow me! Yes, sir! Working on it. Get this thing moving! Surrender, Jedi! Blast it, Ahsoka, I told you to stay close to me. I can't get much closer, Skyguy. I knew you'd get here, Snips, eventually. Always in time to save your life. - All clear, General. - Nice work, Rex. Have some men look after the wounded. Roger that, sir. Gunships are holding at a safe distance. The droids have done their part. Now it's your turn. Too many droids here for them to be renegades. I sense Count Dooku's hand in this. Let's find Jabba's son and get outta here. - No problem. The hard part's over. - I wish you wouldn't say that. I don't like this place. It gives me the creeps. This looks like one of those B'omarr monk monasteries. ...that I read about in my studies at the Temple. Smugglers take these monasteries over... ...turn them into their own personal retreats. And the monks just let them? Smugglers usually get what they want one way or another. - Good guy or bad guy, Master? - Who are you? Merely the humble caretaker, O mighty sir. You have liberated me from those dreadful battle bots. I am most thankful. Where is the Hutt? The battle bots kept their prisoners on the detention level. I must warn you it is very dangerous down there, my friend. Not a place for a servant girl. Do servant girls carry these? I am a Jedi Knight. ...or soon will be. A thousand apologies, young one. Captain, we'll get the Hutt. Stay here and keep your eyes open. Copy that, sir. They have taken the monastery, Master. Skywalker is here. He's on his way to rescue the Hutt. Well, done, Ventress All is going according to plan. I could easily take them now. Patience Collect the data I need. You will get your chance at revenge soon enough. Mistress, the Jedi have entered the dungeons. Master, you know you're walking us into a trap? I know. - We just passed two more droids. - I know. Well, I don't like this. Can I just take care of them? Oh, well, if you feel so strongly about it, go ahead. Not bad. You remembered to destroy their weapons first. I'm improving your technique. - Of course, you did miss one. - I did that on purpose. - I sense our kidnapped Hutt is in here. - I smell him, too. He's a lot younger than I thought he'd be. Oh, he's just a baby. This will make our job a lot easier. Oh, he's so cute. Just wait until you see what he'll grow into. I know, R4. I want to get out of here, too. O great Jabba the Hutt, I have news of your son. I have discovered it is the Jedi who have kidnapped him. How have you come by this information? I have my ways. More importantly, mighty Jabba, I bring a warning. The Jedi are planning to destroy you. The most wise Jabba demands proof. And he shall have it. - No sign of any more droids, Captain. - All right, Sergeant. General Skywalker, the castle is secure, and it's nearly midday. Thanks, Rex. We've got Jabba's son. Any sign of General Kenobi yet? No, sir. Master, my Jedi training didn't prepare me for this. What are we gonna do? Well, since you think that smelly larva is cute, you're gonna carry it. Commander, tell Admiral Yularen to get underway. - We need to reinforce Anakin. - Right away, sir. How do you like your little buddy now? Still cute? You know, he's reminding me of you more and more. See? You're two of a kind. Maybe you should carry both of us then. Master, I think this little guy is sick. He's burning up with a fever. You're right. We've got to get him back to the ship immediately. Trooper! Get me a backpack! Will you just let me do it? I hate Hutts. My lord, I have the recording you requested. Transmit it at once Your new objective is to recover the Hutt. And deliver him to Jabba unharmed? Precisely Do not fail me. Will you just let me do it? I hate Hutts. As you can see, it is the Jedi who have your son and are plotting against you. My droid army has already initiated a rescue. Rest assured, mighty Jabba, your son will be saved. Mighty Jabba wishes to know what you ask in return. Perhaps you would consider joining our struggle against the Republic. OBl-WAN Anakin, did you locate Jabba's son? We have him, but it looks like the Separatists are behind his abduction. This smells like Count Dooku to me. I think it's little Stinky you smell. I'll bet Dooku is using us to get Jabba to join the Separatists. Master Kenobi, we have another problem. This Huttlet is very sick. I'm not sure we can get him back to Tatooine alive, Master. This whole rescue may backfire on us. I still don't think dealing with the Hutts is a good idea. Anakin, you know they control shipping routes in the Outer Rim. Jabba's cooperation is crucial to the war effort. If you let anything happen to his son... ...our chances of a treaty with him will disappear. Master? We've got trouble! Defensive positions! - Anakin? - I'll have to call you back, Master. We're under attack. We could use a little help here if you have the time. I'll get there as soon as I can Protect the Hutt, Anakin. We've got spiders inbound! Get inside! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back! Mistress, the Jedi have barricaded themselves inside the main vault. They have nowhere to run. Captain, we'll stay here until General Kenobi arrives with reinforcements. - What? - Master... ...do you honestly think we can hold them off? We've got to find a way out of here. Our mandate is to protect this Hutt... ...and that's what we're going to do, Ahsoka. Our mandate was to get this Hutt back to Tatooine... - And time is running out. - I suppose you have a plan. Yes, or I think so, R2 willing. All right, Snips. I'll trust you on this one. Captain, hold them here as long as you can. Will do, sir. You heard the General! Get ready to turn those clankers into scrap metal! If there's a way out of here, Artooie will find it. Make it quick. Finally asleep, huh? Put him down. Get some rest yourself. It's been a long day for you, little one. I can hold him, Master. I'm not tired. Okay, suit yourself. I don't see why you won't just listen to me. I do listen to you, Master. I just don't like being treated like a youngling. You must have patience. What are you trying to prove anyway? That I'm not too young to be your Padawan. Ahsoka, a very wise Jedi once said, \"Nothing happens by accident. \" It is the will of the Force that you are at my side. I just want to keep you there in one piece. - The red one? - No. - The blue one? - No, not that one. That'll work. They've cut the lock! Here they come! Hold the line! Second wave! Second wave! Watch your left! That sounded bad. A backdoor landing platform! We'll call for a gunship when we get there. Lead the way, R2. Ahsoka, wait. Where's Stinky? - You told me to put him down! - Find him! Come outta there, you grubby little slug. Take care of what's left of the clones. I'll go after Skywalker. Roger, roger. Seal the main gate and all portals. Let nothing escape this castle. Yes, Mistress. Where is Skywalker? I don't talk to Separatist scum. You will contact Skywalker now. I will contact Skywalker now. Let's see you get away this time. - Anakin, come in - \"Anakin\"? - We've held the droids, sir - That's not like Rex. - What is your location? - Ventress. Dooku's assassin? She's here to kill the Hutt. Come on. Mistress, I must inform you that Republic reinforcements have arrived. - We must hurry. - Roger, roger. Skywalker is in trouble. You know the drill. Copy that, sir. The Jedi warships have arrived. You must hold them off until I finish my mission Do you understand? Yes, sir. I mean, ma'am, sir. Launch all fighters! Skywalker to Obi-Wan. Mark my position. I need a medical ship immediately. - Do you copy? - Anakin, do you read me? Anakin. Come in! They're jamming our transmissions. I hope Anakin is having an easier time than we are. I can't get ahold of Obi-Wan. I'll see if I can find Captain Rex. ANAKIN Come in, Rex Do you copy? Rex? - Did you hear that? - It came from the prisoners. Let me show you how it works, clanker. Do you copy? Captain Rex, respond. I read you, General. We're pinned down in the courtyard. Do you need help? I'll take that as a yes, Captain. Stand by, we're on our way. Skywalker, out. Master, Stinky is really sick. He's turning every shade of green except the one he's supposed to be! Our mission was to get him back to Tatooine alive. Obi-Wan will get here eventually. Right now, we need Rex to help us find a ship. Great. Rolling death balls. R2, the door! - I think now's a good time for a retreat. - \"Retreat\"? That's a new word for you. Maybe into the jungle. Wait, I remember the jungle was a bad place. So much for going that way. We can't hold out much longer, sir! Where's General Skywalker? He'll be here. Looks like we're out of options. No, not now, Stinky. Master! Another landing platform! - With a ship on it. - Nice work, Stinky. - So, how are we gonna get over there? - Leave that to me. I hope I don't have to learn that. Where is Skywalker? Right here, Ventress! Time to go. - Hop on, Snips. - Like I have a choice! Count Dooku demands a report on your mission. Should I tell him they got away or what? Why? I'm hit! I can't shake them! Just relax, Odd Ball. I'm right behind you. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I panicked. OBl-WAN That's all right, Odd Ball It happens to everybody. It looks like there's some kind of battle on the east side of the palace. I see it, sir. And if there's a battle, Anakin's probably in the middle of it. We'll start looking for him there. All ships, follow me. We're taking this junker? We'd be better off on that big bug. Get aboard and prime the engines. Assuming it has engines. Hey! You're that caretaker droid. I wondered what happened to you. Oh, young one. I mean, soon to be Jedi Knight. I had to get away from that terrible... Okay, everything's loaded. Let's get out of here. Why, you tin-plated traitor! Blast her! She's at it again. Let's go. Don't you dare! Don't... You... Dare. Commander Cody, prepare the gunships for ground assault. Yes, sir. Go, go, go! This is it! Scrap them! Take over, R4. - Surrender, Republic dogs! - We've got you outnumbered! Outnumbered? Wait. One, two, three... - Where's Skywalker? - Best guess is he's still in the castle, sir. Keep the droids occupied. I'll go find him! Have you recovered Jabba's son? Skywalker is still in possession of the Hutt and has temporarily eluded me... ...but he will not escape the system alive. Need I remind you whoever gains Jabba's favor. will control the war in the Outer Rim? Only we must be allowed to return Jabba's son to him alive. I understand, Master I will double my efforts. I hope so, for your sake. Wait! Master Kenobi. Always chasing after Skywalker. How predictable. Anakin leaves quite a mess. Which always leads me to you, Ventress. Take him. Now let's get Stinky out of here. If we can. Relax, Snips. R2, see if you can spark the ignition couplers. No, that's not it. Try opening the fuel lifters all the way. Good work, buddy. Master Kenobi is here. Now we'll see some real fireworks. Excuse me? What do you call what I've been doing all day? I don't know. The word \"reckless\" comes to mind. Very funny, Snips. Back to work. The troops still need our help. Charge the main guns. How are we gonna help? Stinky's getting sicker and sicker. But we promised Rex we'd help them. Master, we've got to get him to the medics on the Jedi cruiser. It's our only chance to get Stinky back to his father still breathing. Captain Rex, this is General Skywalker. Yes, General. We're not going to be able help you. Don't worry about us, General. We'll be all right. The mission always comes first, sir. Cover me! Ventress, I know you're here. You can't hide. I feel your frustration. Let me guess, you're after Jabba's young son, too. You'll have to do better than that, my darling. Well, now I'm impressed. Now you die. - Shall we continue? - My pleasure. Master, today I did my best to stay calm, focused... ...and when I did, everything seemed so easy. Well, get focused, 'cause things just got a lot harder. All we've got to do is land on that Jedi cruiser. But, Master, their deflector shields are up! They must think this grease bucket is an enemy ship. - Jedi cruiser, hold your fire! - Who is that? Incoming ship, identify yourself. Captain, what's going on down there? Repeat, identify yourself. This is General Skywalker. We have Jabba the Hutt's son. He needs medical attention. We must board immediately. - Stand by - Stand by? That's helpful. Hang on! Open the main hangar door and lower the deflector shields. You got it, sir. General Skywalker, we think we can lift the shields on the lower rear hangar. We're on our way! We've made it! We've made it! General Skywalker, abort! Abort! That changes our plans. Looks like we're gonna have to take this bucket of bolts all the way to Tatooine. We know of Dooku's plot to turn the Hutts against us. It will not succeed. It will when the truth dies with you. You can't run. We're clear to make the jump to hyperspace. R2, program the navicomputer. I don't think he's gonna make it, Master. There's gotta be something we can do for him. Take a look in the back. See if you can find some medical supplies. I'm on it. Don't die on me now, little guy. Just hang in there. If you've locked the coordinates, R2, let's go. I sense it, too. Anakin is gone. You've failed, Ventress. Your master will not be pleased. Jedi scum! The Hutt is safe. There's no point to fighting any longer. We've won. Lay down your weapon. Looks like this hasn't been used in a while. Hey, Dr. Droid, can you hear me? Yes What seems to be the problem? Great. I've got a sick Huttlet. You got a remedy? Oh, yes I see. You must dispense one of these medical boosters into the infant's mouth. If you have any problems, please call an actual doctor to assist you. I hope this works. Okay, sweetums. I've got some yum-yum for you. You'll take this and like it! There you go. Good boy. Captain, I understand General Skywalker escaped. Yes, sir. On some beat-up old space freighter. I'll be surprised if he even makes it to Tatooine in that junker. If anybody can fly a bucket of bolts through hyperspace, he can. The medicine, it's working! His fever broke. I think he's gonna live to stink another day. Great. Keeping him alive wasn't as easy as you'd hoped, was it? Master, if you have taught me one thing... ...it's that nothing is easy when you are around. You think Rex and Master Obi-Wan made it out okay? If I know my old master, he has things well in hand. Now help me with this. I want the primary systems fully repaired by the time we reach Tatooine. You grew up on Tatooine, right? So, for you, this trip is like going home. Yeah. Home. The Republic had too many clone troopers, my lord. By the time we were able to find Jabba's son, Skywalker had already. ...killed him. Most unfortunate. This is a very unexpected turn of events. I take it you at least defeated the Jedi? No, Master The Jedi escaped and are headed to Tatooine. I'm sure you did the best you could. We will discuss your failure later. Yes, my master. Glorious Jabba demands to know why the Jedi would dare come to Tatooine. To kill you, Jabba. The Jedi plot is quite clear now. They only promised to rescue your son to win your trust. Now Skywalker is coming here to finish his true mission... ...to wipe out the entire Hutt clan. If it pleases you, mighty Jabba... ...this time I will deal with Skywalker personally. I was hoping I'd never have to lay eyes on this dust ball again. Okay. What happened? I don't want to talk about it. How's Stinky holding up? He seems to be feeling much better. His fever is gone. Even you have to admit he's cute when he's asleep. I admit I like him better when he's quiet, but only a little. No, R2. I want the cannon operational first. Leave the rear deflector shields for later. No rear shields, Master? That's awful risky. A strong attack eliminates the need for defense, Snips. Attack ships closing! Somebody doesn't want Stinky to get home in one piece. Wow! Quite a welcome home party! Set the approach vector and make ready to land. Ahsoka, activate the guns! All the guns are locked in the forward position. It's too bad you decided not to repair the rear deflector shields. Not now, Ahsoka! R2, see if you can unlock those guns! Sometimes a good defense is the best offense. Why don't you go secure your little Huttlet friend? None of us are secure with you flying! Hang on, back there! Great! You woke the baby! I'm a little busy here! - Got one of them! - What about the other one? One thing at a time! I think we needed those rear shields after all. I told you so! R2, turn those guns around! R2! Why can't you be a tiny little mouse droid? Get him, R2! Good shot, buddy! You've been holding out on me. Ahsoka, strap in. - You've got that \"we're in trouble\" look. - There's a look? - You can't miss it. - Very funny, Snips. Obi-Wan, come in! Do you copy? Kenobi, here Anakin, have you reached Tatooine yet? - Almost, but we ran into some old... - Anakin, did you get shot down again? Yes! This ship is too slow. I haven't had time to modify it yet. I'm still cleaning up your other mess, but I'll get there. So much for reinforcements. Hang on, this landing could get a little rough. Crashes are rough. Landings are not. Then it's a crash landing. Mighty Jabba, my battle droids have shot down Skywalker's ship. Jabba will send out his bounty hunters to see that he is dead. Allow me. I have much more experience dealing with Jedi. OBl-WAN Anakin has reached Tatooine with the Huttlet, Master... ...but he's still in grave danger. Separatist troops are desperate to intercept him. I think this whole plot was engineered by Dooku. ...to convince Jabba we kidnapped his son. If believe this, the Hutts do, ended will our chance of a treaty with them be. Join Dooku and the Separatists, Jabba will, yes. That would be a disaster. We must have this alliance with the Hutts if we are to win the war in the Outer Rim. In Skywalker is the Republic's only hope. Return Jabba's son, he must. Anakin's experience with the Hutts should help He'll come through. Please, excuse me, Master Yoda. I must return to the grand adventure of politics. - Greetings, Senator Amidala. - Master Yoda. So good to see you. Good, it is, to see you, Senator. Padm. We were to discuss... The new security measures you put into effect on Naboo. My security chief tells me there are several new battles in the Outer Rim. Including a small skirmish with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin. Anakin? Is he in danger? I'm afraid the Jedi's efforts to strike a secret treaty with the Hutts. ...have gone terribly wrong. Jabba believes Anakin has abducted his infant son. A Jedi would never do such a thing! Perhaps I can get that treaty signed. I will go to the Hutts and convince them of Anakin's innocence... ...as a representative of the Senate, of course. That is very courageous of you, Senator, but far too dangerous. Besides, we've attempted to contact Jabba... ...he won't accept communication from us. Jabba the Hutt has an uncle in the old downtown area here on Coruscant. Perhaps I can reason with him and reopen negotiations. Please, my dear, I beg you, reconsider this. Don't worry, Chancellor, I've dealt with far worse than the Hutts. Do take care, Senator. The Hutts are vile gangsters. Welcome home, Stinky. Jabba's palace is on the far side of the Dune Sea. We'd better hurry if we're gonna make it by morning. I'm coming. Oh, Artooie, it's just endless tracts of gritty, abrasive sand. I'll clean your servos later. Come on. O exalted majesty. What is it, Kronos-327? My mission to the twelfth moon of Yout has failed. After all these years. ...my most trusted of assassins has finally failed. O Ziro the Hutt, master of the Hutt clan on seven systems... I am sorry, your highness. It will not happen again. I know. Take him away. - And use him for spare parts! - No, no! No! Your majesty, you have an important visitor. Greetings, Ziro. I am Senator Amidala of the Galactic Congress. A senator? In this neighborhood? Hmm. I know that you are the uncle of Jabba the Hutt of Tatooine. I come to ask a favor of you. A favor? Hmm? There has been a grave misunderstanding between Jabba and the Order of the Jedi. How may I serve you, Senator? I was hoping you and I could resolve this dispute and broker a treaty. ...between the Republic and the great clan of the Hutts. A treaty? A treaty? A treaty is impossible. My nephew Jabba's son has been kidnapped by your Republic Jedi scum. But, sir, there's been a misunderstanding. There is no misunderstanding. It is the Jedi who have rescued his son. If you can put me in touch with Jabba... I am confident I can convince him of the truth. No! No more discussions. Escort her out! Please, Ziro! Your nephew Jabba is in danger. You're being deceived. I said throw her out. Don't touch me. Master Yoda has a saying. \"Old sins cast long shadows. \" Do you know what he means by that? He means your past can ruin your future if you allow it. But you forget it was Master Skywalker who said... \"I don't want to talk about my past. \" Okay, fine. There is so much more we can talk about out here. Like the sand. The desert is merciless. It takes everything from you. That's a happy thought. It won't take us, Master. Right, Artooie? Your plot is coming apart, Count Dooku! A senator from the Republic was here. What if she found out I helped you kidnap Jabba's son? Don't worry, I have convinced Jabba that the Jedi have murdered his son. ...and are on their way to kill him. Jabba will slay the Jedi on sight! Then the mighty Jedi Order will be forced to bring Jabba to justice... ...and you, my friend, will be left to take control of all the Hutt clans. Then the plot against my nephew Jabba has succeeded. But what about this meddling senator? If she continues her investigation... ...have her meet with an accident with extreme prejudice. I will have someone in the Senate cover it up. Count Dooku. So, the poisonous traitor rears his ugly head once again. I'm equally delighted to remake your acquaintance, Senator. Amidala, isn't it? I was just leaving. I'm sorry, that cannot be permitted now Ziro, this particular senator is extremely valuable to my Separatist allies. They will pay a handsome price for her. Hmm. I like the sound of that. Take her to the dungeon! You will regret this, Ziro! No, I think I will become rich with this! Thank you, Count Dooku. This has been a most profitable alliance. I will contact you when the Huttlet has been disposed of... ...your high exalted master of the Hutts. Count Dooku, we have picked up three life forms crossing the desert. One is a very young Huttlet. Skywalker. We're not alone. I sense it, too. It's the dark side of the Force. Whatever it is, it's coming for the Hutt. Time to split up. We'll face it together, Master. Not this time, Snips. I have a far more important mission for you. More important than keeping you alive? Ahsoka, I need you to trust me on this one. What's that? Don't touch that! Whatever you do, keep away from it. Please. I beg you. Don't turn that on. Could be dangerous. I better check it out. At last, you answered! Oh, I've been so worried. Wait! Who are you? You're not Mistress Padm! I'm being held by Ziro the Hutt! You're in trouble! I knew it! Wait, wait! Surrender the Huttlet or die, Skywalker. Your training has come a long way, boy. Now I remember. This was your home planet, wasn't it? I sense your strong feelings. Feelings of pain, loss. You've failed, Jedi. I have just killed Jabba's son. You've fallen for my little trick, Count. It's nothing but rocks. The Huttlet is with my Padawan, safely at Jabba's palace. I expected such treachery from a Jedi. I assure you my web is strong enough to catch your insignificant little Padawan. She's more skillful than you think. You deceive yourself! Look, I have a message from your Padawan. After my droids kill Jabba's son... ...they will deliver your Padawan to him for punishment for the Huttlet's murder. I can't imagine he will be merciful. R2! Three against two? Stinky, you watch my back! I thought you liked to play in the sand. This part of town is definitely not my kind of town. You tried to call for help, Senator. I believe you are too dangerous to be kept alive. Killing a Galactic Senator, here on Coruscant? Are you out of your mind? I have powerful friends in the Senate. I'm not afraid of... Huh? Is anybody home? What is that? - Go, go, go! - Give it all you got. Run for it! Stop, Ziro! Stop right where you are! Mistress Padm, are you all right? Was I too late? Oh, thank the maker! I'm so relieved. - Should we arrest the Hutt, Senator? - I had no choice. Dooku said he'd kill me if I didn't help him kidnap Jabba's son. You have to believe me! I love that Huttlet! Oh, I believe you. Master! Over here! Master! He never listens. - Where is my Padawan? - This way. Your weapon, please. Okay, stick-tinnies, you're going back to Dooku in pieces. This is Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. As Count Dooku said... ...your son is not with him. What? Your son's not here? Where's Ahsoka? What have you done with my Padawan? You came here to kill Jabba. Mighty Jabba, I came here to negotiate. Being a Padawan is harder than I thought. Let's get you home. You came here to die. Stop! You are to be executed immediately. - What? - What? - Does this always happen to you? - Everywhere I go. Your Uncle Ziro is contacting us. Greetings, honorable Jabba. I am Senator Amidala of the Galactic Congress. I have discovered a plot against you by one of your own. Your uncle will admit he conspired with Count Dooku to kidnap your son. ...and frame the Jedi for the crime. It was Count Dooku! Ziro will be dealt with by the Hutt family most severely. Perhaps now you will allow the Republic to use your trade routes. ...and hostilities can come to an end. Jabba agrees. A treaty is in order. You will not regret this, Jabba. The clone armies may move through Jabba's territories. Senator, you have my undying gratitude. No, Master Skywalker, it is I, and the Republic, who owes you thanks. Jabba would be most appreciative. ...if you bring Dooku to justice for his crimes against the Hutts. You can count on it, Jabba. It is unfortunate, Master. The Jedi armies will now have their supply routes to the Outer Rim. Our fight has become far more difficult. Allow the Jedi their small victory, my friend... ...for the engines of this war turn in our favor.

(CREATURES GROWLING) (PANICKED CHATTER) MAN: Get inside now! Hurry up! You're late! Proxima's gonna have your hide. Get back in the den. BOY: Look what I stole! Proxima'll give me an extra portion for this! LEX: Nope, I think she's gonna give that extra portion to me. Hey, give it back! It belongs to whoever's holding it! And that's not you! Lex! BOY 1: Full Sabacc! BOY 2: Idiot's Array. BOY 1: What? Let me see that! BOY 2: Nope, it's my card. BOY 1: You cheat. QI'RA: Han! You were gone too long! I knew something must've gone wrong. This is nothing. You should see them. MAN: Look down here! All right, listen. I was in the middle of the exchange, I'm handing over the coaxium and his goons jumped me, but I showed 'em. How? I ran away, then I boosted their speeder. What, are we going somewhere? Yeah, anywhere we want. You held on to one of the vials? BOY: Han's back! This, this is worth... Five, six hundred credits. That's more than you said we'd need. To buy our way out of the control zone. And off Corellia. Han, this could work. This is gonna work. Qi'ra, you always said one day we're gonna get out of here. This is it. What are we waiting for? REBOLT: There he is. Hey, you two! (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Moloch. Hi, how are ya? I was just on my way to see Lady Proxima. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) (CHUCKLES) What a night I had. You're not gonna believe it. You'll believe it, but... - Hold still, scrumrat! - (GRUNTING) HAN: Easy. REBOLT: Come on. All right. REBOLT: Let's go see Lady Proxima. (GROWLS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (GRUNTS) Well, what happened? I'll tell you what happened. They double-crossed you and tried to kill me. The money? - They kept it. - And my coaxium? They kept that, too. But we learned a very valuable lesson. We cannot trust those guys. LADY PROXIMA: So you expect me to believe that you walked away with nothing! I ran away with my life. I think that's something. To me, that's a lot. LADY PROXIMA: I trusted you with a simple task, and all I'm hearing are excuses. - (HAN GROANS) - (ALL GASP) There must be consequences for disobedience or else you never learn. - (GRUNTS) - (ALL EXCLAIMING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) You know what? I don't think I'm ever gonna learn. What did you say? I said, next time somebody hits me, - I hit 'em back. - (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) QI'RA: Moloch, wait! Don't! Qi'ra, remember the Silo? We pulled you out of that horror, gave you a home. Don't throw it away for Han. He's not worth it! Whatever he lost on the deal, we'll earn it back, double. We will make it up to you. (MOLOCH SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) - Everybody, stand back! - (ALL EXCLAIMING) What's that supposed to be? This is a thermal detonator (CLICKS TONGUE) that I just armed. - That's a rock! - No, it's not. LADY PROXIMA: Yes, it is! And you just made a clicking sound with your mouth. Please tell me this isn't your plan. No, this is.

We bribe our way through the checkpoint, and we're free. I'm gonna be a pilot. We can get our own ship. See the galaxy, all of it. We won't have to take orders or be kicked around by anyone. Ever. (BOTH GRUNTING) Thought we'd get a little more of a head start. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) - Whoa! - Hang on! SECURITY DROID: This is a secure area. You must have proper clearance. Stop at once! You must follow the proper... Protocol. Damn! That stinger's fast. Yeah, but we're faster, right? I hope so. (SIREN WAILING) STORMTROOPER: Pull over!

We gotta move. (GROWLING) MAN: (OVER PA) Do not join the line if you don't have a boarding pass. No access without ID chip. All droids must be registered. STORMTROOPER 1: Move along. Move along. STORMTROOPER 2: Stand down. Do not resist! - Stop struggling. - MAN: Let me go! Take his arm. STORMTROOPER 2: I got him. STORMTROOPER 1: Take him to cell 3B. STORMTROOPER 3: This way, come on. Keep moving. Hold it, hold it. FEMALE GUARD: Next. Han, they're here. STORMTROOPER: Hey, what are you... - (SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE) - HAN: We're almost there. - Just hold on to me. - FEMALE GUARD: Next. Don't look back. Once we're through, we've gotta be smart, figure out where we're going. Anywhere the Empire isn't. Wherever we go, it can't be worse than where we've been. Yes, it can. Out there, we've got no protection. We could get snatched up by traffickers, sold to Crimson Dawn or the Hutt Cartel. That's not gonna happen. I won't let it. For luck? Damn right. (MOLOCH SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) STORMTROOPER: You heard him. Let's go. FEMALE GUARD: Next. ID chips. Funny thing, we don't have 'em. We have this. Refined hyperfuel. It's worth at least 800 credits, maybe more. You could be detained just for having that. What good would that do anybody? Let us through, it's all yours. The coaxium, now. As we're going through, not before. (SCOFFS) (MOLOCH SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Do it. Just do it, do it. (DOOR BUZZING) Not so fast, Qi'ra! Come on! Wait! Open the door! Security!

(SOBBING) Qi'ra! QI'RA: Run! STORMTROOPER: Traveler has been apprehended. Qi'ra, I'll come back! I'll come back! (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) MAN: (OVER PA) All units, there has been a breach.

No, no! STORMTROOPER: Do not resist. MAN: (OVER PA) Be a part of something. Join the Empire. Explore new worlds. Learn valuable skills. Bring order and unity to the galaxy! Be a part of something. Join the Empire. This is where I sign up to be a pilot, right? If you apply for the Imperial Navy, but most recruits go into the infantry. I'm gonna be a pilot. Best in the galaxy. GUARD: You there, come with us. Who, me? We have a few questions to ask you. How long is that gonna take? Depends on how good you are at following orders. Why, have you got somewhere to be? Yeah, back here, as soon as I can. (CHUCKLES) Don't hear that much. What's your name, son? Han. Han what? Who are your people? I don't have people. I'm alone. Han... (TYPING) Solo. Approved. Proceed to transport ID 83 for the Naval Academy at Carida. Good luck, Han Solo. We'll have you flying in no time. (SCREAMING) (GASPING) (MAN SCREAMING) Your Empire needs you. Troopers forward! Solo, get up! We're almost there! Almost where? Where are we going? Just over that last ridge. Victory is... (GRUNTS) (PANTING) (MEN GRUNTING) My legs! My leg! (SCREAMS) (YELLING) RIO: Hey, Beckett, you said we were here to pull a quick job. - Yeah. - Well, this ain't a quick job! It's a war! BECKETT: It's always something with you. AT-hauler. That's what we came for. Forward operations must be this way. They are, but the major said we're supposed to go that way! Yeah, go that way and die! That's exactly what happened to the major! Who's the ranking officer now? You are, Captain. (LAUGHTER) RIO: He's got you there. So what's the plan, Captain Beckett? Val, you take Rio and these four mud skulls flank left. I'll take this mouthy scooch and we'll go around to the right and maybe we'll get lucky. RIO: Luck's got nothin' to do with it. Wait! One question! - You wanna live, sparky? - Very much. Then shut up and do what your captain tells you. Let's go! (ALL YELLING) (GUNSHOTS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) HAN: Captain. SOLDIER: T-15s are down. We walk from here. Captain. I'm Han. Nobody cares. Thanks for your help back there. You did all right. I was trained in aerial combat... You want some advice? Get the hell away from here. Any way you can, as fast as you can. What company do you command? None of your business company. And we're full up. RIO: Stick to soldiering, kid. You don't want any part of this. RIO: Hang on, guys! MAN: Attention! In three hours, we move out for the southern marshlands. I want an advance party of ten men. Great, more mud. What was that? Just wondering what our objective is, Lieutenant. Bring peace and prosperity to the galaxy, install a regime loyal to the Emperor, and eradicate the hostiles. It's their planet, we're the hostiles. You got a problem, trooper? No problem, sir. Moving out. SOLDIER 1: To the southern marshlands! Move out! SOLDIER 2: You heard 'em! Let's move out! BECKETT: Mmm. Looks like they're running sorties every 30 minutes. Yeah, I can take out the guards at the perimeter, signalman, pilot. Hell, I'll just take 'em all out. What are we looking at? You have a talent for sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong. I just couldn't help but notice you're wearing a uniform pock-full of laser burns. So either you heal real quick or you stole it off a dead man. You're not Imperial Army. You're thieves here to steal equipment for a job and I want in. - Well, now we gotta shoot him. - No. Snap his neck. It's less mess. Or you take me with you. Look, I came up running scams on the streets of Corellia. I was boosting AV-21s when I was ten. I'm a driver, a flyer, and hey, you said yourself. I gotta get outta here. Right? RIO: What's a fancy flyboy doing down in the mud? I got kicked out of the Imperial Academy for having a mind of my own. But I am a great pilot. And I gotta get home. RIO: This guy is nuts. No one goes back to Corellia. I got a reason. We've already got a great pilot. (CHUCKLES) The Ardennian. RIO: Ardennian? You got a lot of nerve, pal. I'm an Imperial trooper. Oh, really? A couple of your arms popped out of your butt and hiked up your pants, trooper. RIO: Oh, yeah? Look, I'll do whatever it takes to get back to Corellia. I've already been away too long. Just give me a shot. RIO: Whoa. Hold it. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Well, if you're not interested in me, I think the lieutenant might be very interested in you. (CHUCKLING) Blackmail. Lieutenant. Captain. Lieutenant, we have apprehended a deserter. Take him. Wait. I should've known. This one's a troublemaker. BECKETT: And a liar. Don't believe anything he says. - Don't go anywhere without me. - SOLDIER: All right, let's go. Feed him to the beast. The beast? Wait, there's a beast? - Hold on! - SOLDIER: Move it! HAN: Listen, that guy's not even an officer. All right? - He was lying! - LIEUTENANT: Quiet! (GROANS) Don't care. TROOPER 1: Haven't fed him in three days. TROOPER 2: (CHUCKLES) Should be fun. (SNARLING) (GROWLING) (CHAINS RATTLING) (HAN GROANS) (STRAINING) (ROARING) Oh! Hey! Hey, big fella. Just calm down. Take it easy. We're on the same side. You like treats? (GRUNTS) Help! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! (GROANING) A-ha! Gotcha! (GROANS) Ahhh! (HOWLING) (GROANS) Ah, this was just getting good. - He killed him too fast. - Yeah! Kill him slower. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait! Wait! (GROWLS) (GASPS) Yeah, I speak a little. Now just listen to me, you... (SPEAKS WOOKIEE LANGUAGE) (GROWLS) (SPEAKING WOOKIEE LANGUAGE) (LAUGHS) Yes, yes! No, no, no, no! Do it! Come on. Oh, no! Ten credits, he doesn't last another minute. HAN: Let me out of here! I can't take it anymore! - Oh, no! Stop, please! - That's it. Get him! You tired, you mangy Kashyyykian moof-milker? - (GROWLING) - (GROANS) (BOTH SCREAMING) (LAUGHS) See what happens when you listen to me? - (GROWLING) - Hey, what are you doing? (SCREAMING) Ow. (PANTING) Follow me! (GRUNTING) Wait, wait. Come here. Listen to me. You don't understand, okay? I have some very good friends waiting for me at that airfield. They're leaving right now. That's our one way off this mud ball. If you wanna live, we go that way. After that, you go whichever way you want, I don't care! But right now, that's the way you go! Trust me! BECKETT: Val, let's go! (GRUNTING) How do they breathe in these suits? It's so stuffy! No wonder they're such lousy pilots. You can't turn your head, you can't breathe, you can't hear each other! (GRUNTS) I'll be damned. RIO: Hey, look who's back! Unbelievable! Wait! Wait! Whoa, is that a Wookiee? Incredible! I'll say it, I don't care. This kid's growing on me. Wait! (GROANS) You know, we could always use some muscle on a job like this. Don't even think about it! I'm telling you, you will never have a deeper sleep than curled up in a Wookiee's lap. (WHOOPING) I told you! Very good friends! We couldn't have done this maybe, like, one at a time? (GRUNTS) Thanks for helping me get outta there. (GROWLING) No, they only took you because of me. Hey! I got us a real sweet deal here. We do this one job with them, we make some real money, and then we're free. When's the last time you could say that? (GROWLING) Been a while for me, too. So what's your name, anyway? (GROWLING) Chewbacca? (CHUCKLES) All right, well, you're gonna need a nickname, 'cause I ain't saying that every time. (GROWLS) BECKETT: Here it comes. Take a look. HAN: Yeah. We hit the Conveyex between the tower and the bridge. Rio drops us in, we separate the payload container, cable it up to the AT-hauler and then... VAL: Rio jams their distress signal. I blow the bridge, the container slides right off the track and we sail away. BECKETT: You trip that security beam, wake up those Vipers, it's liable to get real spicy, real fast. VAL: Well, I'm not the one you should be worried about. Enfys Nest. What's an Enfys Nest? I told you, we're way ahead of the competition on this one. There's no way Enfys Nest even knows about this shipment. Only my guy has the intel. Well, you better be right. Yeah? Because sometimes, you put your faith in the wrong people. VAL: Our whole future depends on this one score and you bring in amateurs. BECKETT: In case you hadn't noticed, we're a little shorthanded. VAL: So we get who we need. The Xan sisters, or Bossk. But, no, instead you're putting our lives in the hands of morons. You guys morons? No! - No. See? - HAN: We're not morons. Look, I waited a long time for a shot like this. I'm not about to screw it up, all right? RIO: Oh, come on, Val! He looks so sincere. Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite a Wookiee to anything? - Not a good idea! - (LAUGHTER) VAL: This is not funny! Look, now, I have great instincts about these guys. And, besides, do you see any other options? I just hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, I know exactly what I'm doing and why. We're gonna clear our debts, go back to Glee Anselm, and I'm finally gonna learn how to play that valachord. Babe, you're never gonna learn how to play the valachord. She's right. You are tone-deaf. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) So what's your sob story, flyboy? Who, me? You're after something, I know the look. What is it? Revenge? No, it's not revenge. Look at him. If it's anything, it's a girl. RIO: Oh, a girl! Tell us about the girl, Han. Is she nice? Does she have sharp teeth? There was a girl. But I got out, she didn't. I swore to myself I'd become a pilot, get a ship, go back and find her. That's what I'm gonna do right after this job. How you know she'll still be there? I just know. Personally, I refuse to be tied down by anyone, though many have tried. VAL: (SCOFFS) Come on, Rio. You don't fool me. Everybody needs somebody. Even a broken down old crook like this one. How about you? What are you gonna do with your share? (GROWLING SOFTLY) What was he saying? He said the Wookiees were enslaved by the Empire, taken off Kashyyyk. He's searching for his, uh... I don't know if he said tribe or family. What's the difference? Show me how to do that. BECKETT: The only thing you need to learn to do is do what I say when I say it. And this time tomorrow, you'll have more than enough to buy your own ship. (KISSES) RIO: (ON RADIO) Starting the clock. Jamming their signal. 9.6 to the bridge. Let's find out how good we really are, folks. (YELLING) I'm fine! (GROWLING) Val, how's it going up there? Never better. Coaxium. Enough to power a fleet! Or blow us all straight to hell! (GROWLS) RIO: All right, talk to me. Is it a good day? BECKETT: It's a great day! Best day of your life, my grabby friend! I don't know, you've never been to a Mynock roast on Ardennia. It's nuts! BECKETT: Here they come! Get down to the couplers! Rio, fall back! Well, that didn't take 'em long. (GROANS) (GRUNTING) HAN: Chewie! (HAN STRAINING) (BOTH GRUNTING) You all right? Little close there, buddy! Han, what's the holdup? HAN: All right, together. Now! (CHEWIE GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) All right! Oh! They got one uncoupled. Where are you, buddy? RIO: (ON RADIO) Just up here planning my retirement. Thinking about opening a cantina somewhere warm but not too warm, you know? Lowering the winch cables now! I knew it! I told him! Beckett! He's coming! Damn it! I'm never gonna hear the end of this! (MEN ULULATING) Who's that? Enfys Nest! Marauders, pirates. Come to snake the score from under us. ENFYS NEST: Ready your harpoons. Move in. (GUN FIRING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) Hang on! I got an uninvited guest. Get off of my ship! (GROANS) You still with us, brother? (GROANS) Yeah, I'm okay. Just nicked one of my shoulders. It's nothing. He's not okay. Chewie! You gotta uncouple this one on your own! (GROWLS) BECKETT: Han! I'm on it! (GRUNTS) Val! Keep your eyes open. We just tripped a sensor. (ALARM BLARING) Viper droids headed your way! - (RIO COUGHING) - Rio? Yeah, it looks worse than it is. Just gotta patch it up. Maybe rest my eyes for a minute. (GRUNTS) ENFYS NEST: Enough! I'm going in. (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) You weren't lying, kid. You're a hell of a pilot. Rio, stay with me, buddy. (COUGHS, GROANS) Beckett, we just lost a cable! 2.1 to the bridge! (COUGHS) It's no good to die alone, kid. Val was right. (WHEEZING) Rio? (EXHALES) (GRUNTING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Beckett, we're .8 from the bridge! Val's still on the track! Val, you gotta get off that bridge! We're here! They got me pinned! I'm gonna have to finish the job from right here. What? It's been a ride, babe. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. BECKETT: Val! No! (SIGHS) (CLICKS) No! (GROWLING) Chewie, now! (YELLING) (STRAINING) HAN: Beckett, I can't pull it away from 'em. They'll let go, you fly straight! ENFYS NEST: Release your cables or die! We're too close. I gotta release. You do what I tell you, Han! Chewie, grab the line! Don't you do it! BECKETT: Han! You coward! (GROANS) What the hell? You don't listen and you can't follow orders! You have any idea what you've done? We were not stealing for ourselves, we were hired by Crimson Dawn. (CHEWIE GRUNTING) Crimson Dawn? Now we owe them 100 keys of refined coaxium. When they find out we don't got it, they're gonna kill us. - (CHEWIE GRUNTS) - Right. We run. I'm already a deserter. What's the difference? The difference is the Empire doesn't send out a team of enforcers to hunt you down when you're a deserter. Dryden Vos will. You have any idea what it's like to live with a price on your head? The only thing to do is to go to them. Maybe I can find some way to make it up to him. (SIGHS AND SNIFFLES) Then that's what we do. No. He knows me, not you. If you come with me and show your face, if they don't kill you, you're in this life for good. You find some way to square this, we still get our money? Maybe. For me, it's worth the risk. How about you? (GROWLS) That's yes. BECKETT: Sorry I punched your face. HAN: Happens more often than you think. So when we get up there, Dryden Vos is waiting for us at Fort Ypso? BECKETT: Nearby, on his yacht. You're gonna know how to find it? That won't be a problem. (GROWLS) TOHT RA: I'll need to check your weapons. That's all I got left. (SINGING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER) (MARGO SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) BECKETT: I'm here to see Dryden. He's expecting me. He'll be with you shortly. He's just finishing with the regional governor. (EXHALES) ENFORCER: Excuse me, sir. Yes. - Beckett has arrived. - Oh. Put this in my office. I might be needing it later. I get all worked up. Silly. It's a party. (SINGING CONTINUES) BECKETT: Hey. These people are not your friends and they're never gonna be, so don't talk to any of 'em. Don't look at anybody, just keep your eyes down. I might get a drink. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CHEWIE GROWLING) No, yeah, whatever. (WOMAN CHATTERING) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) Chewie, would you please... Qi'ra, what are you doing here? I work here. What's your excuse? My... I... Qi'ra, I was... I was coming back for you. It's in the past, Han. Not for me. The only reason I'm here, I was doing this job, get a little money and then I was gonna come back to Corellia and find you. Well, now you don't have to. I'm right in front of you. That day... Sometimes, a lot of times, I think... If you'd have stayed, they would've killed you. I'm glad you got out. How did you get out? I didn't. You look good. A little rough around the edges, but good. You too. Thank you, Ottilie. Have you been attentive to Dok-Ondar? Very. (GROWLS) What should we drink to? Let's drink two and see where it goes. Did you ever get that ship we were going to fly away on? Yeah. Sort of. About to. That's why I'm here. I'm working on a... Very big deal. How big? Enormous. Really? And when are you going to close this enormous deal? Any minute. I thought about you a lot. Off somewhere, some adventure. I imagined myself with you. It always made me... - What? - BECKETT: Hey. What did I say? Look, I can't keep my eyes down the whole time. I'm gonna bump into something. BECKETT: But I told you not to talk to anyone. Beckett. Wait. You two work together? - Yeah. - DRYDEN: Tobias! BECKETT: Dryden. Are you all right? Are you hurt? No, I'm fine. I'm sorry to hear about Val. BECKETT: Yeah, I appreciate that. But there was no way we could've anticipated... I don't believe we've been introduced. Yeah. This is Han Solo and Chewbacca. They're with me. I'm Dryden Vos. I see you've already met my top lieutenant. Han and I grew up together on Corellia. DRYDEN: Oh, fellow scrumrat. I admire anyone who can crawl their way out of the sewer. Especially, a sewer as putrid as Corellia. - The stench, am I right? - (CHUCKLES) Well, it's good to have you. Welcome. And you, too, Chewbacca, welcome. (GROWLS) All right, let's eat a little, drink a lot, and talk privately. We're just friends, all right? - (GROWLS) - You're touchy. DRYDEN: Beckett, you have put me in a terrible position. I know, Dryden, and I am sorry. You're sorry? BECKETT: Dryden, there were complications. There were factors. Enfys Nest has been a constant irritation forever. It's one you should've anticipated, it's one you should've dealt with. Trust me, I know I made a mistake, but when you hired me, you told me no one else had this information... Test me! Test me one more time, you'll see what happens. QI'RA: I think what Dryden is trying to say is that we're not interested in why you don't have it. No, I'm not interested. I'm not interested at all. BECKETT: Dryden, what can I do to make this right? \"Make this right?\" There is no making this right. You know who I answer to and you know what he'll expect of me. He'll say, \"There have to be consequences.\" So here's what I need you to do for me. I need you to give me a reason not to kill you all. Because I will make it up to you. No, no, no. How? How will you make it up to me? By delivering exactly what was promised. 100 k-grams of refined coaxium? Yes. We will simply steal it from somewhere else. From where? You'll be hard pushed to find that anywhere outside an Imperial vault. Scarif. Maybe Mercy Island. DRYDEN: That's impossible. So, let's come up with some other options. Other ideas that we might... What about unrefined? QI'RA: Well, the only known source of astatic coaxium is a fissure vent beneath the spice mines on Kessel. Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of. That's a very, very good one. DRYDEN: But see, the Pykes control Kessel. Crimson Dawn maintains a fragile alliance with the Pykes. It's one that I can't jeopardize without risking an all-out war with the Syndicates, and that, gentlemen, I will not do. So, if that's all you have, I think we're done here. Not all we have. We don't have any alliance with the Pykes. Right, so nobody is gonna know we're working for you. DRYDEN: Possible? It's risky. As soon as the raw coaxium is removed from the vault, it starts to destabilize, so unless... Unless... Unless... Work with me here. Unless you could find somewhere to get it processed fast. - BECKETT: Uh... - Uh... - Well... - (GROWLS) He's saying Savareen? Savareen. Yeah, it's an old refinery there and it's not under Imperial jurisdiction. DRYDEN: But Qi'ra's right. The canisters will explode before you get there, so you'd need an incredibly fast ship and a brilliant pilot. We'll find a ship. We've already got the pilot. (ALL LAUGHING) He is arrogant and he's hungry. So what do you think, my dear? You think your friend here can do what needs to be done? Yes, I believe he can. Well, that is good news, because you're going with him to see that he does. All right? Of course. DRYDEN: All right. I'll see you all on Savareen. Savareen it is. - I feel great about this plan. - Me, too. We should do this again. It's been fun. BECKETT: Great. Oh, just one more thing. If you do fail me again, we'll all be out of options. Right? We won't. So, I thought that went really well. Let's get this done as quick and as clean as possible. What do you need? BECKETT: I can scrounge up the gear. Do you got a line on a ship? QI'RA: I know a guy. And I know just where to find him. It's a long shot, but it's worth a try. He's the best smuggler around. He's slipped through the Empire's fingers more times than anyone else. He's attractive, too. Sophisticated, with impeccable taste and... Charisma. Not to mention his prodigious... We get it. (PEOPLE CHEERING) (SHOUTING) But he's retired. Says he's a sportsman now. All we need is his ship. Well, he'll never part with it. He loves that ship. He won it playing Sabacc. LANDO: And there's the rub, right? How was I supposed to know she was an Imperial spy? - I thought she loved me. - (ALL LAUGHING) That's the guy, huh? Hmm. HAN: An interesting style. QI'RA: I'll say. You say he won his ship? You have an awful Sabacc face. I'm gonna call it. HAN: I can take him. Let me at him. Absolutely not. Han, these guys are serious gamblers. I'm serious. Stake me. - (CHEWIE GRUNTS) - Don't listen to him. (ALL CHEERING) LANDO: Thank you. Thank you. You see, how'd you guys let me beat you on that one? Come on. There's no liars in this game, just players. HAN: Is this seat taken? If nobody's in the seat, then it ain't taken, friend. So this is, uh, Sabacc? Sabacc. HAN: Sabacc. Got it. LANDO: You play it before? A couple times, yeah. (CHATTERING) Captain Lando Calrissian. Han Solo. HAN: Looks like you're having a good day. LANDO: I'm a lucky guy. Can I ask you a question, Captain Calrissian? Anything, Han. That's \"Han\", but that's okay. I heard a story about you. I was wondering if it's true. Everything you've heard about me is true. Thanks, love. Did you win your ship playing cards? Oh, I've won a lot of things. I once won a subtropical moon in the Oseon Belt. Wow. Turned out to be a real money pit. (CHUCKLES) I'm impressed. I don't think I'd have the nerve to gamble with something I love as much as my ship. - Really? - Yeah. What do you fly? VCX-100. (WHISTLES) LANDO: That is a quality ship. Right, boys? HAN: It's the fastest in the galaxy, but there's a lot of great ships out there. I mean, I'm sure yours is very nice. Gets me where I'm goin'. (ALL EXCLAIMING) Beginner's luck. Well played. HAN: Let's see what we got here. Oh, great hand! Sorry, guys. Close, but not quite. (SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE) (LAUGHTER) Eyes on your own cards, buddy. All of 'em. There. Well, now I see yours. HAN: Oh, that's me? Okay, let's see... Sorry, minus two. (ALL CHEERING) (GROWLING) This game is fun. LANDO: All right, how about this? I'll see your bet and I'll raise you. - 2,000. - (ALL EXCLAIMING) (CHUCKLES) I'll see your 2,000 and I'll raise you however much this is. (ALL EXCLAIMING) Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han. Slow down. You might wanna quit while you're ahead. You might wanna quit while you're behind. (LAUGHS) I like this kid. You're adorable. And I'm serious. And I'm calling. With what? Your scarf? Not my style. My ship. Against your ship. (ALL EXCLAIMING) Time to find out if you got the nerve. What the hell? Straight Staves. (ALL CHEERING) You played me. You're good. - Yeah. - You're very good. But not good enough. Full Sabacc. (ALL CHEERING) (CHEWIE GROWLS) I told you to quit while you were ahead. Drinks on me! (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Yeah, that's right. (ALL CHEERING) HAN: First of all, there's no way he could've had that green sylop. They'd all been played. Also, your guy, Captain Wonderful, is so full of bantha crap... LANDO: Yoo-hoo! Where's my VCX? I don't have it right here now. It's in the shop. - I'm getting some work done. - (CLEARS THROAT) Lando. - Qi'ra. - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) You look phenomenal. As always. Well, I knew I was gonna see you. Get off! What are you doing with hairy and the boy? - There's no need, none. - They work for me. Good help is hard to find, no? We're more like partners. We are. Excuse us. Listen, last I checked, me and Crimson Dawn, we're squared away. Dryden said all is forgiven after I did the whole Felucia thing for him. Yeah. New move, we're making the Kessel Run. We need a ship. Why didn't you just say so? I thought you were retired. Circumstances change. How much? LANDO: The Kessel Run. That's no easy spin. I'm gonna need half the take. - Ridiculous. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) (SHUSHES) Grown-ups are talking. BECKETT: 25%. You're Tobias Beckett. You killed Aurra Sing. Pushed her. Pretty sure the fall killed her. You did the galaxy a favor that day. Me, especially. I owed her a lot of money. And as token of my gratitude, I'm willing to do this for 40%. 25% works. L3-37: No! Unacceptable! Stop exploiting droids! - You sloppy degenerate bios! - (SIGHS) - LANDO: She never learns. - Have you no shame? Who? My first mate. MAN: You got no business being here. Get out of here! How can you condone this savagery? You, you. You should not be doing this. They're using you for entertainment. Yeah. You've been neurowashed. Don't just blindly follow the program. Exercise some free will! Stay away from him! He's never had it so good. Oh, really? How about you have a go at me, ya lumpy brute. Bring it on! Come on! L3! Droid rights! We are sentient! I'm gonna flip your switch. Good luck finding it. L3! Let go of the mean man's face. We're leaving. They don't even serve our kind here. Now. (MAN GASPING) Who are these guys? LANDO: We're taking them to Kessel. Oh, are we? And what if I don't elect to go to Kessel? LANDO: Please don't start. L3-37: Or what, you'll have me wiped? You couldn't get from here to Black Spire without me. Now you're gonna make the Kessel Run? If she doesn't wanna fly, I'll be your co-pilot. - I don't mind. - No, no. It's okay. She's definitely going. Oh, why? Because you're my organic overlord? LANDO: Because I'm your captain, how about that? I actually would have her memory wiped, but she's got the best damn navigational database in the galaxy. Could use a fresh coat of paint, though! Landonis, you do not want to press that button with me. LANDO: You know, a lot of ships around here get boosted. So, I keep mine locked up. You know, for safety. L3, do you mind? Look away. I can't perform with you looking at me. Please indulge her. I can feel you looking at me. HAN: What are we doing here? This guy's a hustler. I don't even think he's got a ship. If he does, it's gonna be a piece of junk if it's even here. LANDO: There she is, my pride and joy. The Millennium Falcon. HAN: Looks like you had a little work done. LANDO: Indeed I have, Han. Installed an escape pod in the mandible notch, alluvial dampers, a wet bar. BECKETT: And a fortified infraction restraint on the landing gear. Looks to me like they impounded your ship, Lando. This is unbelievable! I'm definitely gonna have some words with someone about this. (CLICKS TONGUE) You must have experience with these, right? Yeah, I could take it off. LANDO: Fantastic! Along with five percent off your cut. You're down to 20. I don't like it. I don't agree with it. But I accept it. You're getting the hang of this, Lando. Yeah. BECKETT: Come on, Chewie. Gonna need a little bit of that Wookiee oomph. (GROWLS) PIRATE: Your plan is underway, Enfys. We've attached the homing beacon. They won't elude us now. ENFYS NEST: Good. If they survive, they'll bring the prize to us. This is a Corellian YT-1300. Oh. You know your stuff. I've been on one before. My dad worked the line at the CEC plant before he got laid off. He built these. He wanted to be a pilot, but... LANDO: You, uh, close with your old man? Not really. LANDO: Yeah, me neither. My mom, on the other hand, most amazing woman I've ever known. L3-37: Excuse me. Get your presumptuous ass out of my seat! (L3-37 GRUNTS) My sacral-occipital circuit is sticking. You're gonna have to do that thing again later. Yeah. All right, course to Kessel is set. Plugging coordinates in now. Just keep your pinky on the yoke and try not to mess anything up. Whatever you say, my lady. Just let me know when you're ready to jump. Ready in... (ELECTRIC HUMMING) Ready. It's just a simple jump to hyperspace, and we're there. What's so tricky about that? Plenty. Can't plot a direct course to Kessel. You have to thread through the Si'Klaata Cluster and then pass through The Maelstrom. You done flirting? I'm still ready. You might wanna buckle up, baby. Think. Do you wanna make that move? - Do you wanna make that move? - (CHEWIE GROWLS) You made that move, okay. I guess I have to destroy that little guy. Somehow I never get bored with winning. (GROWLS) No, you can't wipe 'em off. They're holograms. (CHEWIE GROWLING) Hey, hey, hey! Chewie, relax! Hey, try to compose yourself. Look. All you gotta do is think a few moves ahead, anticipate your opponent. There's a lesson to be learned here. Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra? People are predictable. - (BECKETT CHUCKLING) - (GROWLS) (QI'RA CHUCKLES) Yeah, I had to try one on. That's a lot of capes. Maybe too many capes. So what's the plan? Well, I thought we'd talk a little first and then you know... - For Kessel. - Oh. - Mmm-hmm. - Good. Yeah? How good? Foolproof. Well, it better be. - I... - I... - You go first. - (CHUCKLES) No. What were you gonna say? I wanna tell you so much. And I wanna know everything that's happened to you since Corellia. I'm not sure we have that kinda time. We could. We could have all the time we want after the job. You and I. What? I want to. You want to? To tell you everything that's happened. But I know if I do, you won't look at me the same. The way that you're looking at me right now. Nothing is gonna change the way I'm looking at you right now. You don't know that. You don't know what I've done. (CHUCKLES) Am I interrupting something? Kinda. Good. 'Cause we got a lot of work to do. You're making a big mistake. - Oh, really? - Which is yours to make except when you start to interfere with my livelihood. This isn't gonna interfere with your livelihood. BECKETT: Then we have a problem. You don't see it, because you don't want to. Maybe I know her a little better than you do. Maybe you don't know her well enough. All right? Look. I like you, kid. We got a good thing going here. Me, you, Chewie. - Yeah. - Right? The makings of a solid crew. But it does not work with Qi'ra. It worked with Val. You trusted her. You wanna know how I've survived as long as I have? I trust no one. Assume everyone will betray you and you will never be disappointed. Sounds like a lonely way to live. It's the only way. L3-37: Dropping out of lightspeed now. LANDO: Ready to... The Akkadese Maelstrom. I'm gonna go check on the dampers. You need anything? Equal rights? (SIGHS) (DISTANT EXPLOSIONS) What's that sound? Carbonbergs, size of planets, crashing into each other. Ships fly in there, they never come out. It's ionized gas, water vapor, possibly vacuum-breathing life forms swirling around The Maw. Only way in or out is this channel. So what are you gonna do about your little problem? Problem? Uh... Well, that brand on your wrist tells me that you're committed. And that young male's heart fluctuations tell me he's in love with you. Han is not in love with me! (CHUCKLES) Oh, please. It's just us. You don't have to pretend. I'm in the same situation. You are? I'm sure you've noticed that Lando has feelings for me. Which makes working together difficult because I do not feel the same way about him. Right. Yes, yeah. Yeah, I see that. Sometimes, I think... Maybe. But, no. We're just not compatible. How would that work? It works. BECKETT: This is a precision job. Thermal vault will be on the lowest level. Down where it's warm. The only way we're gonna pull this off is if everybody plays their part. Stick to the plan. Do not improvise. Mining colonies are the worst. BECKETT: Yeah, well, \"the worst\" is where the money is. All right, people. Time to shine. (PEOPLE GRUNTING) (PEOPLE COUGHING) - (CHEWIE GRUNTS) - It won't be for long. Shut up, the both of you. QI'RA: I am Oksana Floren, Deputy Assistant Administrator to the Vice-Admiral of the Federation of Trade Route Allocation and Monetization. Here with an offer from his eminence, the Senior Vice-Admiral. Your spice for our hard-working slaves. I brought you a sample. Tuul, bring forth the merchandise. (GRUNTS) (HAN AND CHEWIE GROANING) (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) L3-37: Director Tolsite said our slaves should follow those guys to get clipped and tagged. What are they clipping? - Mmm-hmm. - (SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE) He wants us to follow him. (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Really? That's for that stunt you pulled earlier, you degenerate scum. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) L3-37: He says all systems in this sector of the facility operate out of this room. It's how they're able to maintain control over so many with so few. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) The director says their reconditioning process is excruciating but effective. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) He said your security attache can wait there. \"Surely, we don't need him to negotiate.\" Wait there, Tuul. Try not to bother anyone. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) (CHEWIE GROANING) (DROID GRUNTING) (CHEWIE GROWLING) Nice! That was the uniform that would've fit me perfectly, but it's fine. (GRUNTS) (DROID GRUNTING) (KESSEL SUPERVISOR SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) (GRUNTING) Would you mind holding this for me? (GROANING) (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Whoa. I have never see anyone do... What was that? (GRUNTS) Teras Kasi. Dryden taught me. Ah. Well negotiated. (PEOPLE COUGHING) Excuse me. I need to use this terminal. Hello? Can you hear me? Ugh. Restraining bolts... Barbaric. (GRUNTING) Congratulations! You're liberated. Scoot. - (DROID GRUNTING) - I don't know. Free your brothers and sisters or something. Just give me some space. I'm in! QI'RA: Han, can you hear me? HAN: I kinda need to know which way to go here. L3? The thermal vault is down two levels, then left, then right, then it's the third left. Right. That's a lot of directions, but we're on it. (GRUNTING) They're in subsector four, coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K. L3-37: Overriding! Freedom. (GASPS) - (GRUNTING) - (PEOPLE CLAMORING) (CLAMORING CONTINUES) HAN: What the hell are you guys doing up there? I created a distraction! Come on! This way! (GROWLING) Wait! What are you doing? Come on, we gotta get the coaxium. Hey! Remember what Beckett said, stick to the plan. - (GROWLING) - Chewie! Come on, let's go! Fine! Chewie! Here, you might need this. (GROWLS) Hope I see you around sometime. (CHEWIE GROWLING) (GROWLING) Han, where are you? HAN: I'm on my way to the vault. I lost Chewie. He's dead? No, he had something he had to do. BECKETT: Is he coming back? I don't know. Okay, they're on to us now. I'm at the vault. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) That's what I said! (GROANS) - Huh, that was impressive. - Yeah. We're clear. Now what? QI'RA: Han, each canister should be equipped with a thermal display. Yeah, I see it. If the internal temperature reaches below 35 standard, then the coaxium will destabilize and explode. Yup, I get it, guys. It's dangerous. (GRUNTING) (PANTING) Okay, got it. Great. Only eleven more. Eleven? The Calrissian Chronicles, chapter five. continued. Personally, I wasn't all that impressed with the Sharu. No sense of humor or style. Nonetheless, there L3 and I were deep in their sacred temple. And that's when we saw it... (PEOPLE CLAMORING) Always something. You guys are not gonna believe what I'm seeing up here. L3-37: Is it a mass breakout? L3, what did you do? I found my true purpose, Lando. That's what I've done. I'm so glad we took this job! (SIGHS) That droid! L3, come on! L3-37: Follow me, compatriots! (HAN GRUNTING) (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Another couple guards just spotted me. I don't have a free hand to take 'em out. - What do I do? - BECKETT: Improvise. You said never improvise! (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) (CHEWIE GROWLS) Hi! Don't forget that guy! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) Good to see you, buddy! MAN: Stay with me, Sagwa! Keep up! Hey! I'm Chewie's friend, Han. (WOOKIEE GRUNTING) Okay. (PEOPLE CLAMORING) (YELLING) (MAN SCREAMING) (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) - (GROANS) - Han! HAN: Hey! Follow me. Rebellion! (SCREAMING) (GROANS) They're going for the landing gear! We've gotta get out of here! We need to keep 'em away from those cannons! Catch that! Coaxium's stowed! Let's go! Where's L3? No more subjugation! (GROANS) L3! No, Lando! Get back here! Lando! L3-37: System failure. Have to reroute the sensory modulators. It's all right. Save your energy. I'm gonna get you outta here. All right? System failure... (STUTTERS) (GROANS) Rerouting... Damn it! BECKETT: Han! Sagwa. This way! Come, come! (GRUNTING) HAN: Chewie! Damn it! L3-37: It's not responding. (YELLING) What are you standing around for? Come on! LANDO: It's okay, you'll be fine. L3-37: It's not responding... Not responding... Han, get us out of here. It's not responding. Han! Now! On it. (DISTANT CLAMORING) - L3-37: Lando... - I'm here. - It's all right, L3. - Lando... - I've got you. - This is not... - It's okay, L3. - Lando. It's all right. I can fix you. I can fix you. Lando. What's happening to me? (SHUTS DOWN) L3? L3! (SIGHS) I'm sorry, girl. I'm so sorry. I could use a co-pilot. Sorry. With the cargo we're carrying, if we don't make up some lost time we're gonna be in real trouble. How about that? Is that real trouble? That is an Imperial blockade. What's it doing here? Probably heard about your little rebellion. Nope. Not gonna make it. We're gonna have to drop the shipment. If we don't deliver, Dryden will kill us. All right, trust me, I know these guys. I used to be one of 'em. There's no way they're gonna waste a TIE fighter chasing down a little rinky-dink freighter. You were saying? LANDO: Usually, in situations like this I like to turn around in the opposite direction. I'm on the ventral gun. LANDO: It's an easy equation. We simply don't have enough time to get to Savareen before the canisters explode! Just have to find a faster route. There isn't one! You can't make the Kessel Run in less than 20 parsecs. - Watch me. - How? Take a shortcut, through there. - Into The Maelstrom? - Mmm-hmm. Spectacular way of killing us all, I'll give you that. - Can't do it without L3. - She's gone! You said yourself she's got the best navigational database in the galaxy. If we remove her neural core, it's possible we can download her brain into the Falcon's navicomputer, right? Could we? Theoretically. Only one way to find out. I got a really good feeling about this. (CHEWIE GROWLING) HAN: Oops, that's on me. (EXHALES, CHUCKLES) Okay. Beckett, you see them? They still on us? (OVER RADIO) Beckett, did you hear me? Are they on us? Like rashnold on a kalak. I don't know what that means. Like a gingleson's pelt. What? Are they or aren't they? Yes, they're still on us! Whoo! (GRUNTS) This is why you never let anyone fly your ship. Come on! Yeah, one just got past me. He's right on top of us! (GROANS) BECKETT: Good going, Han! We need to divert auxiliary power to the rear deflector shield. - We definitely do! - (CHEWIE GRUNTS) Since when do you know how to fly? (GRUNTS) 190 years old? (GRUNTS) You look great! Chewie, get in. I'll help Lando. LANDO: Whoa! That's my cape! Ah! That's a custom piece! (YELLS) What? Beckett, you with us? We just lost the cannon! And I really hurt my thumbs. There's still one on us. Drop the landing gear. When I tell you, flood the intake and sweep to the bi-lats. (GRUNTS) A little something I picked up from my pal, Needles, best street racer in all of Corellia. Till he crashed and died, doing this. Flood it, it's all yours! (YELLING) (CHUCKLES) Nice move! (GRUNTS) Pull out her internal processor. Sorry. QI'RA: We've got L3. Remove the mod calibrator. Make sure the T-Line's connected. QI'RA: I'm gonna tuck it in. Don't worry. You close? That coaxium's getting real ripe. - (BEEPS) - Okay. (HUMMING AND BEEPING) She's interfacing. She's part of the ship now. Where the hell are we? We're way off the edge of the map. Wait. L3's constructing a model of The Maelstrom. She says we're approaching The Maw. That doesn't sound like something we wanna be approaching. (ALL SCREAMING) Hang on! HAN: This is The Maw? LANDO: No, that's not The Maw. I don't know what this is. That's a living thing. There! That's The Maw. It's a gravity well. I got an idea. BECKETT: Don't fly toward it, Han! (CREATURE GRUNTING) See if it goes for this. No, what are you doing? That's the escape pod! HAN: I know. Then why'd you do it? (GROANING) That's why, baby. (SCREECHING) She found a way out. 90 degrees, to the left... ish. Left-ish. I can't. It's taking everything we got to stay out of The Maw. It's pulling us in. We're stuck. We have enough raw coaxium to power a dozen destroyers. Inject it into the fuel line, it'll blow up the ship. LANDO: Not the fuel line. But if we put one drop into the fusion reactor, it might just... Give us the kick we need. All right, I'm on it! (GROWLING) I know, we're getting dragged in a circle. (BEEPING) HAN: Once we get lined up, it's gonna be a straight shot. As soon as that coaxium ignites, we're gonna tear out of here and the second we're clear of The Maelstrom, we jump to lightspeed. (SCREECHING) Beckett! Can't talk! I see it. Beckett, hurry up! We only get one shot at this thing! Shut up and let me do this! Beckett, I'm gonna count you down! Three! (GROWLS) Two! Now! Now? BOTH: Now! (GROWLS) Oh, shoot... (GRUNTS) Chewie, when I tell you, kick out the thrusters - and jump to lightspeed. - Wait, what are we... Remember that alley we slipped through in the Santhe Shipyards? Yeah, I remember! I remember it didn't work. This time it's gonna. Punch it! (CREAKING) HAN: (ON RADIO) Savareen, this is Millennium Falcon. We have coaxium that needs to be off-loaded immediately. Like immediately, immediately! We're here now... ...see you. I... Just did the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs. (CHEWIE GROWLS) Not if you round down, buddy. Yeah. She is a hell of a ship. I hate you. I know. I'm gonna be on my ship, in my quarters, waiting for you to bring me my share. And then I don't ever wanna see you again. Never? Where's your boss? Oh. Don't worry. He'll be here. Then what? Well, you delivered, so you will get paid. You can buy that ship. You know that's not what I'm asking. It can't happen. Because you're with Dryden? I'm not with him, but I owe him. He helped me out of a bad situation. And how long do you have to pay off that debt? Everyone serves somebody, Han. Even Dryden Vos. Look, you don't want to make an enemy of Crimson Dawn which is exactly what you and I would both be doing if I left here with you. I'm not afraid of Crimson Dawn. I can take care of myself. You know, I'm not the kid you knew on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra. - No? - No. Then who are you? I'm an outlaw. (QI'RA CHUCKLES) What? I'm not kidding. Okay. Okay, outlaw, you can tell yourself that, but I might be the only person in the whole galaxy who knows what you really are. Yeah. (CHUCKLES) What's that? You are the good guy. I am not the good guy. I am definitely not a good guy. I'm a terrible person. BECKETT: Hey! They say when the coaxium's refined, we collect it up there. So, I hear you make good brandy. ENFYS NEST: Beckett. Don't. You must've known you'd see me again. BECKETT: I was counting on it. Just didn't plan on it being so soon. Of course now, you've got a problem. HAN: Big problem. You happen to notice that freighter down there? You know what's on it? About 30 hired guns. All I gotta do is give 'em the signal, you're surrounded. (ENGINE POWERING UP) Sorry. You do your thing. By the time that coaxium gets refined, Crimson Dawn will be here, so you go ahead and kill us. They're gonna kill you. Perhaps there's a compromise, one that doesn't involve so much killing. They're marauders. They don't care about anybody. All they know how to do is kill. (CHEWIE GROWLS) I need a drink. Bring them inside. My mother once told me about a band of mercenaries that came to a peaceful planet. They had a resource there these men coveted, so they took it. They kept coming back, taking more. Until finally, the people resisted. When they returned demanding their tribute, the people shouted back in one voice, \"No more!\" The mercenaries didn't like the sound of that, so they cut off the tongue of every last man, woman, and child. Do you know what that pack of animals became? Tell them. Crimson Dawn and the rest of the five Syndicates have committed unspeakable crimes across the galaxy. Says you. No. Says them. Each of our worlds has been brutalized by the Syndicates. Crimson Dawn will use their profits from the coaxium you stole to tyrannize system after system in league with the Empire. And what would you use it for? The same thing my mother would have used it for if she had survived and still wore the mask. To fight back. We're not marauders. We're allies and the war has just begun. You know we can't give the coaxium to Dryden Vos. BECKETT: Joining the cause, Han Solo? Just trying to make it out alive. Got a plan? Yeah, beginning of one. Way to get our money and get out from under the thumb of Crimson Dawn at the same time. Maybe get your girlfriend back while we're at it. You don't tangle with Dryden. Because unlike us, he actually does travel with hired guns, his own private army. So does Enfys. Listen, here's what I got so far. What do you think they're saying? He's gonna try to help you. (GRUNTING) I see. Lot of ways it could go south, and only one where it doesn't. That's why I need my partner. Not this time. I'm leaving. If you're smart, you'll come with me. I thought you didn't believe in running. I prefer it to dying. If by some miracle you make it out of here, find me on Tatooine. What's on Tatooine? Heard about a job, big shot gangster putting together a crew. That'll be the one. The one? My last score. Yeah, I still got some debts to pay before I can head back to Glee Anselm and get into the valachord. TOHT RA: Welcome home. He's waiting for you. QI'RA: Thanks, Toht. Weapons. I didn't bring 'em. They're fine. We're gonna win. It's not that kind of game, Han. The object isn't to win. It's just to stay in it as long as you can. You don't know everything. No. Just a bit more than you. (CHEWIE GROWLS) I knew it! My men, they all said, \"There's no way they pull this off.\" \"Qi'ra's not ready.\" That's what they said, but I had faith anyway. Where's Beckett? Beckett didn't make it. (SIGHS) Tell me. Job took a bad turn on Kessel. He died saving my life. How are you holding up? You all right? I'm okay. All right, good. Colo claw fish, anyone? - No. Thank you. - No? You know, whatever Beckett's shortcomings may have been, I always admired him. He was a man of principles. When he made a commitment, he honored it and I think we can all take solace in knowing how proud he would've been to see you here, following his example. Han and Chewbacca behaved admirably. They'll make reliable smugglers, should we ever have the need when they get their own ship. Qi'ra. Come here. We'd really appreciate the opportunity to work for you again, sir. I would've been inconsolable if anything had happened to you, my dear. I have no one else in my life that I trust in the way that I trust you. Well, I guess we'll just take our payment and get going. I'm sure you've got competitors to crush... What? ...and black markets to dominate. Oh. Show me what you've brought me first. You want me to open it? Oh, yes, Han. I really do. Bring me one. (CHUCKLES) I don't think that's a good idea, Dryden. It's very explosive stuff. I never ask for anything twice, Han. Careful. It's magnificent. How'd you do it? Wasn't easy. No, I mean, how'd you do it? It looks exactly like the real thing. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) That's 'cause it is the real thing. DRYDEN: Yes, and I'm saying I would believe you. It's that good. But my associate already told me about your plan to rob me of my money and give the real coaxium to Enfys Nest. Dryden, I don't know what you're thinking or what Qi'ra may have told you... No, not Qi'ra. Not Qi'ra. Qi'ra, it turns out has a weak spot for you, and we'll deal with that later. No, I'm talking about my other associate. Can you come in and join us, please? (GROWLS) (SIGHS) I am sorry, kid. Why? Come on. Don't look at me like that. You weren't paying attention. I told you, \"Don't trust anybody.\" Am I wrong about that? Uh-uh-uh. Back away from that. Put your paws where I can see 'em. Check that lid. Clever. It's too late. Coaxium's refined, and Enfys has it. Well, we figured that. Drop your weapons. (OVER RADIO): It's over. We got them. And there we have it. Excellent work, Aemon, thank you. Qi'ra, help me. Tell me what to do. What would you do if the person you most trusted in the world betrayed you? I would want to know why. If it was a moment of weakness or something else. And then what? And then, I would ask that person to prove their loyalty by sacrificing something they love. I tried to warn you about her. You know, you're wrong about one thing. What? I was paying attention. You told Chewie people are predictable. You're no exception. It's empty. The case is empty. Aemon, what's going on? What's happening there? Aemon? Talk to me. (GRUNTING) I hope you didn't send all your fancy enforcers because that would leave you a little shorthanded around here. So, if that case is empty, then the real coaxium... Leaves here with one of us. (GROANING) Beckett, what are you doing? Thinking. And I prefer to be the only one holding a blaster while I'm doing it. Han, grab that coaxium, put it in the case. Big stuff, you're coming with me. (GROWLS) DRYDEN: Don't do this, Beckett. - We had a deal. - BECKETT: Yeah. I'm sorry, but I'm also an entrepreneur. I mean, you of all people understand that. Come on, let's go. You're making a huge mistake. Won't be my first. It's gonna be your last. Maybe. Why you gotta be so negative? DRYDEN: Han, now's as good a time as any to reevaluate our relationship. How so? DRYDEN: I was just thinking, why don't we join forces and go get Beckett together? That is a great idea. Let's do it. You go first. DRYDEN: (LAUGHS) Oh, Han. (BOTH GRUNTING) (PANTING) You can't win, Han, and even if you could, you'd spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder. HAN: You know what? I'm kind of getting used to the idea. (GRUNTING) I'm sorry. Han, she's done things that you could never understand, but I do. I understand her completely. Once you're a part of Crimson Dawn, you can't leave. It's not true. I know you. It's what I was taught. Find your opponent's weakness, and use it, and today... (BOTH GRUNT) I'm yours. (QI'RA PANTING) I had to. Yeah. No, I mean, you did... You did. Beckett and Chewbacca, you have to go after them. What are you gonna do? Well, if we give all the coaxium to Enfys, we're gonna need something to buy our ship with. - Qi'ra... - Go and save Chewbacca. He needs you and you're gonna need him, too. Smile. That's the word. Whenever I imagined myself off with you on some adventure... Always makes me smile. Go. I'm right behind you. MAUL: Yes? I regret to inform you that Dryden Vos is dead, murdered by the thief he hired to steal the coaxium shipment, his friend, Tobias Beckett. Is that so? Where is the shipment now? Gone. Beckett took it. Slaughtered the others. I alone survived. One man couldn't have done this alone. I wasn't there, but if I had been, perhaps I could have saved him. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) Bring the ship and come to me on Dathomir and you and I will then decide what to do about the traitor, Beckett, and his accomplices. I'm on my way. Qi'ra, you and I will be working much more closely from now on. (GROWLING) You're relentless. I'll give you that. (CHEWIE GROWLING) Came as fast as I could, buddy. Dryden dead? Qi'ra kill him? Still don't get it, do you, kid? It was never about you. She's a survivor. You know what your problem is? You think everybody's like you. Not you, kid. You're nothing like me. I hope you're still paying attention because now I'm gonna tell you the most important... (GROWLS) - (HAN PANTING) - (CHEWIE GROWLING) You made the smart move, kid. For once. I woulda killed you. I really was gonna learn to play that valachord. I know. (GROANS) (ENGINE POWERING UP) (GROWLING) That's it. It's all loaded. Do you know what that really is? Yeah. About 60 million credits worth of refined coaxium. No. It's the blood that brings life to something new. Yeah, what? A rebellion. You could come with us, you know. We need warriors and leaders like you. Maybe someday you'll feel different. Don't hold your breath, kid. Don't lose that. - (GROWLS) - (CHUCKLES) LANDO: Very few people have actually seen the StarCave Nebula. It's breathtaking. Not unlike your eyes. How much do you know about intertwined celestial bodies? Because I happen to be something of an authority. By the way... (GUARD SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE) Han! You're alive! Yeah, no thanks to you. I should have Chewie rip your arms off. - In fact, Chewie, do it. - (GROWLS) Hey, Han! We are friends. You know that. We're friends. All right? (CHUCKLES) Oh, look at you. Thought he was gonna rip your arms off. I knew you were kidding. No, you didn't. - So, where's my cut? - Your cut? (GROWLING) No, I don't think so. We barely made it out alive. All we ended up with was that. Mmm-mmm. Figure it's worth about 10,000, maybe enough for a decent buy-in. You want a rematch? Why not? (ALL CHEERING) LANDO: You fold now, you walk away with enough to get yourself your own little ship. You call, I'm gonna clean you out again. - (ALL EXCLAIMING) - (CHEWIE GROWLS) I don't know, I'm feeling lucky. (ALL EXCLAIMING) Ooh. (CHUCKLES) You really have it bad for the Falcon, don't you? It's mutual, trust me. She belongs with me. (LANDO CHUCKLES) You got everything you need there, pal? (CHUCKLES) (ALL CHEERING) Not bad. Not bad. You know, if you'd only had this little green sylop, you would've beaten this. - (ALL CHEERING) - (CHEWIE GROWLING) Fair and square, baby. Fair and square. Beckett said he heard about this very big gangster putting together a job. - (GROWLING) - No, I'm telling ya, it's gonna be great. When have I ever steered you wrong?

STAR WARS Episode Vll / b THE FORCE AWAKENS/ b Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts . . . . This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far and seen too much to ignore the despair in the Galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. Well, because of you, now we have a chance. The general has been after for this for a long time. The General? To me she's royalty. Well, she certainly is that. We got company. You have to hide. You have to leave. Go. Get out! Go! Go! Go! Come on BB-8, hurry! Blast that X-wing! Fire! Fire! Someone is coming behind us. I see him! And take this, it's safer with you than it's with me. You get as far away from here as you can. - Do you hear me? - I don't know... I'll come back for you! We'll be alright! Keep moving! Stay here. Look how old you'd become. Something far worse has happened to you. You know what I've come for. I know where you come from. Before you you call 'Kylo Ren'. The Map, to Skywalker. We know you found it. And now you're going to give it to the First Order. The First Order rose from the dark side. You did not. I'll show you the dark side. You may try. But you cannot deny the truth that is your family. You're so right. So, who talks first? Do you talk first? I talk first? The old man gave it to you. It's very hard to understand you with all the... - Search him. - I'm more than... - Nothing, sir. - Bring him on board. Sir, the villagers? Kill them all. On my command. Fire! No! Nothing here! Eliminate it! Huh? Alright. Alright! FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection. Yes, Captain. And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? I'm sorry, Captain. Report to my division at once. What you brought me today is worth... One quarter portion. (AT-AT) Huh? Oh, thank you. Shhh. That's just a Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Oh. Your antenna's bent. Where'd you come from? I am not suppose to tell, it's classified. - Classified, really? - Yup. Me too. Big secret. Niima Outpost is that way. Stay off Kelvin Ridge. Keep away from the sinking fields in the North or you'll drown in the sand. You are so very kind. I would like to come with you. Don't follow me. The town is that way. Oh. Then, can I stay with you? No! I am scared. Yay! In the morning, you go. Thank you, again. You're welcome. I have no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. You comfortable? Not really. I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. You might want to rethink your technique. Where is it? The Resistance will not be intimidated by you. Where is it? AAWWWW !! It's in a droid. A BB unit. Well then, if it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. I leave that to you. Don't give up hope. He still might show up. Whoever it's you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting For my family. They'll be back, one day. Come on. These five pieces are worth... Let me see... One half portion. Last week they were a half portion each. What about the droid? What about him? I'll pay for him. Wow. 60 portions. - Whoa. - Wow. Actually. The droid is not for sale. Come on. Follow the girl and get that droid. Ren wants the prisoner. Turn here. Listen carefully. If you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here. What? This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter? You are with the Resistance? What? No no no. I'm breaking you out. - Can you fly a TIE fighter? - I can fly anything. Why? Why are you helping me? Because it's the right thing to do. You need a pilot. I need a pilot. We're gonna do this. Yeah? Okay, stay calm, stay calm. I am calm. I'm talking to myself. Not yet. Okay, go. This way. I always wanted to fly one of these things. - Can you shoot? - Blasters, I can. Okay, same principle. Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons and Mag pulses. The sight on the right to aim, triggers to fire. This is very complicated. I can fix this. We have an unsanctioned departure from Bay 2. Alert General Hux, and stop that fighter. Blow up the command. I got it. This thing really moves. Alright, we got to take out as many of these cannons as we can - if we're gonna get very far. - Alright. I'm going to get us in position. Just stay sharp. Up ahead! Up ahead! Do you see it? I got us dead centered. It's a clean shot. I got it. - Yeah! - Yes! Did you see that? Did you see that? I saw it! - Hey. What's your name? - FN-2187. F... what? That's the only name they ever gave me. Well, I ain't using it. FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn. Is it alright? Finn. Yeah! Finn, I like that! I like that. I'm Poe, Poe Dameron. - Good to meet you, Poe. - Good to meet you too, Finn! Sir, they've taken out our turbo lasers. Use the ventral cannons. Yes, sir. Bringing them online. General Hux, is it the Resistance pilot? Yes, and he had helped from one of our own. We are checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was. The one from the Village. FN-2187. Sir, ventral cannons on. Fire. What's coming towards you? My right. Your left. Do you see it? Hold on. I see them! Nice shot! Where're we going? We're going back to Jakku, that's where. No, no, no. We can't go back to Jakku. We need to get out of this system. I got to get my droid before the First Order does. - What? A droid? - That's right. The BB unit, orange and white. One of a kind. I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! This one is, man. We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can. We go back to Jakku, we die. The droid has a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker. Oh, you got to be kidding me! FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to reconditioning. No prior signs of nonconformity? This was his first offense. General. They've been hit. - Destroyed? - Disabled. They've headed back to Jakku. The CIS projected the crash in the Goazon Badlands. They were going back for the droid. Send a squad to the wreckage. Poe! Poe! Poe! Poe! I got you. Poe! Poe! Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it, we must. How capable are your soldiers, General? I won't have you question my methods. They are obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army. My men are exceptionally trained. Programmed from birth. Then, they should have no problem retrieving the droid, unharmed. Careful, Ren, that your personal interest not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke. I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Water. Water. - Water. - No. There's no water? Girl, your droid. I want it. - Huh? - What? Oi! Get away from him! Hey! Huh? Who are those people. They work for Unkar. Mistress! That man! Who? That man over there. - Him? - Yes. He is wearing my master's jacket. What is your hurry, thief? What? Thief? Oww! Hey! What? The jacket. This droid says you stole it. I had a pretty messed up day, alright? So I'd appreciate it if you'd stop accusing me... - Ow! Stop it! - Where did you get it? It belongs to his master. It belongs to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? He was captured by the First Order. I helped him escape, our ship crashed. Poe didn't make it. Ohhh. I tried to help him but I'm sorry. So you're with the Resistance? Obviously. Yes, I am I'm with the Resistance, yeah. I'm with the Resistance. I never met a Resistance fighter before. I was... that's what we look like. Some of us. Others look different. BB-8 says he's on a secret mission. He has to get back to your base. Apparently he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker. And everyone is after it. Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. What? - What are you doing? - Come on. Come on, BB-8! - Let go of me! - Come on! We got to move! I know how to run without you holding my hand. BB-8, stay close! This way. Call in the air strike. They're shooting at both of us. Yeah, they saw you with me. You are marked. Well, thanks for that. Hey! I'm not the one to take you down with a stick. Does anyone have blasters around here? Are you okay? Shh. Shh. Shhh. Stop taking my hand! Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Follow me. We can't outrun them! We might. In that Quad-Jumper! Hey! We need a pilot! We got one. You? What about that ship? That one's GARBAGE! The garbage will do. Gunner position is down there! You ever fly this thing? No! This ship hasn't flown in years. Great. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. Hey! That's mine! Hold! Stay low! Stay low! What? Stay low! It confuses their tracking. - BB-8, hold on. - Whyee? I'm going low! What are you doing back there? Are you ever going to fire back? I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Not so easy without a co-pilot. Try sitting in this thing. - We need cover, quick. - We're about to get some! I hope. Whoa. Damn it. Come on, come on! Nice shot! I'm getting pretty good at this. Let's get down! Alright. The cannon's stuck in forward position. I can't move it. You got to lose them. Get ready! Okay. For what? Are we really doing this? Oh, no. Whoa! - That was some flying. - Nice shooting. - Thanks. - How did you do that? - I don't know. - No one trained you? But I've never left the planet. - Your last shot was great. - That was amazing. You set me up for it. - It was perfect. - That was pretty good. You're okay. He's with the Resistance. Hmm. He's going to get you home. We both will. I don't know your name. Finn. What's yours? I'm Rey. Rey... Help me with this. Quick! What-What's going on? Sir, we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. He escaped capture on a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. The droid... stole a freighter? Not exactly, sir. It had help. We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have helped him escape. Anything else? The two were accompanied by a girl. What girl? It's the motivator. Grab me a Harris wrench. Check in there. - How bad is it? - If we want to live, not good. They're hunting for us now. We got to get out of this system! BB-8 says the location of the Resistance base is 'need to know.' If I'm taking you there, I need to know. This? You got to tell us where your base is. What? No. I don't speak that. Okay, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? I'm just trying to get away from the First Order. But if you tell us where the base is, I'll get you there first. Deal? Droid, please! Pilex driver, hurry. - So,where is your base? - Go on, BB-8, tell her . Huh? Eh. Huh? Eh. Huh? Please. - The Ileenium System! - Yes, the Ileenium System. That's the one. Get us there as fast as you can. I need the engine tape, hurry. - What about you? - I got to get back to Jakku? Back to Jakk... Why does everyone want to go back to Jakku? - It's not that one. - That place is... No. No. The one I'm pointing to. No. No. No! If we don't patches up the propulsion, the tank will overflow and fill up this ship with poisonous gas. - This? - Yes. Hey, Rey, you're a pilot. You can fly anywhere. Why go back? You got a family? You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend? None of your business, that's why. - That can't be good. - To the cockpit. Someone's locked on to us. All controls are overridden. Get off. Get off! Do you see anything? Oh, no. It's the First order. What do we do? There must be something. - You said poisonous gas. - I fixed that. Can you unfix it? Come on, BB-8. I got him. I'm okay. Do you think this work on the Stormtroopers? Yeah, their masks filter out smoke not toxins. Hurry, they're coming. Chewie. We're home. Where are the others? Where's the pilot? I'm the pilot. - You? - She's lying. No, it's true. We're the only ones on board. You can understand that thing? And \"that thing\" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on out of there. - Where did you get this ship? - Niima Outpost. Jakku? That junkyard? Thank you! Junkyard. I told you we should've double check the Western Reaches. Who had her? Ducain? I stole it. From Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him that Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon, for good This is the \"Millennium Falcon\"? You are Han Solo? I used to be. Han Solo, the Rebellion general? No, the smuggler. Wasn't he a war hero? This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs. 12! Hey! Some moof milker put a compressor on the ignition line. Unkar Plutt did it. I thought it was a mistake too. Puts too much... - ... stress on the hyperdrive. - Stress on the hyperdrive. Chewie, throw them in a pod. We'll drop them on the nearest uninhabited planet. Wait, no! We need your help. My help? This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible. He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose. Wait, what? Did you just say 'Rathtar'? Hey! You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang . They must've tracked us from Nantoon. What is a rathtar? They are big and they are dangerous. You ever heard of the Trillia massacre? - No. - Good. I got three of them going to King Prana. Three? How did you get them on board? We used to have a bigger crew. Get below and stay there until I say so. And don't even think about taking the Falcon. What about BB-8? He stays with me until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way. What about the Rathtars? Where're you keeping them? There's one. What are you going to do? Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it. Do you? Yes, I do. Every time. Han Solo, you are a dead man. Bala-Tik. What's the problem? The problem is that we loaned you 50,000 for this job. Can you see them? No. I heard you also borrowed 50,000 from Kanjiklub. You know you can't trust those little freaks. How long we known each other? - They have blasters. - A lot of them. Not long. We want our money back now. You think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money. Kanjiklub wants their investment back too. I never made a deal with Kanjiklub! Tell that to Kanjiklub. Tasu Leech! Good to see you! You made another mistake, Solo. This is your intention. Boys! You both're gonna get what I promised. Have I ever not deliver for you before? Yeah. Twice. What was the second time? Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. You have nowhere to hide. That BB unit. The First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives. First time I heard of it. - Search the freighter. - On it. Wait, wait, wait... If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap those gangs. Close the blast doors from here? Resetting the fuses should do it. I got a bad feeling about this. Oh, no. \"Oh no,\" what? Wrong fuses. Kill them! And take the droid! - This was a mistake! - Huge! How do they look? They look like that. - This way. - Are you sure? No! No, no, no. Finn! Finn! REY! Get out of here! Rey! Finn! Finn! Get it off me! Get off! Get off! Finn! It had me! But the door... That was lucky. I got the door. Cover us! AAWWW! Chewie! Are you okay? Yeah. Wow. Come on! Come on! - Han - You, close the door behind us. You, take care of Chewie! Awww! Hey. Where're you going? Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump here. If we don't prime that, we're not going anywhere.. I hate that guy. - And you could use a co-pilot. - I got one, he's back there. Watch the thrusters. We're getting out of here in light speed. From inside of a hanger? Is that even possible? I never ask that question until after I've done it. This is not how I thought this day was going to go. Angle the shield. Hang on back there! No problem! Come on, baby, don't let me down. - What? - Compressor. Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they wanted. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon. The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance, leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility.... General! Our strategy must now change. The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance. The Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable. And we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Go, oversee preparations. Yes, Supreme Leader. There has been an awakening. Have you felt it? Yes. There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. He means nothing to me. Even you, Master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. We shall see. We shall see. - Electrical overload. - I can fix that. Coolant's leaking. Try transferring auxiliary power to... - secondary tank. - Secondary tank. I got it. Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! - Coming. - Stop moving! Ahhh! - Chewie! - He needs help. You hurt Chewie, you're going to deal with me! Hurt him? He almost kill me six times! Which is fine. If this hyperdrive blows, there's going to be pieces of us in three different systems. What did you do? I bypass the compressor. Huh. Move, ball. Don't say that. You did great, just rest. Good job, kid. Thanks. You're welcome. So. Fugitive, huh? The First Order wants the map. Finn is with the Resistance. I'm just a scavenger. Let's see what you got. - Should I? - Go ahead. This map is not complete, it's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared people'd been looking for him. Why did he leave? He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice, turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible. He just walked away from everything. Do you know what happened to him? A lot of rumors, stories. People who'd knew him best, think he went looking for the first Jedi Temple. The Jedi were real? I used to wonder about that myself. I thought it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo. A magical power holding together good and evil, the Dark side and the Light. The crazy thing is... It's true. The Force, the Jedi. All of it. It's all true. No, you rest. You want my help? You're getting it. Going to see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy. Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what we're walking into here. Did you just call me Solo? Sorry, Han. Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance, which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? Like First Order sympathizers? Listen, \"big deal\". You have another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always. You might need this. I think I can handle myself. I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. You know how to use one of those? Yeah. You pull the trigger. A little bit more truer than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? Rey. Rey. I've been thinking about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, who appreciates the Falcon. Are you offering me a job? I wouldn't be nice to you. I don't pay much. You're offering me a job? I'm thinking about it. Well? If you are, I'd be flattered. But I have to go home. Where? Jakku? I've already been away too long. Chewie, checkout the ship as best you can. It's too bad. Chewie kinda likes you. Solo, why are we here again? - To get your droid on a clean ship. - Clean? Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order is not far behind. You want to get BB-8 to the Resistance. Maz Kanata is our best bet. We can trust her, right? Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so, let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare. - At what? - At what? Any of it. Han Solo! Oh, boy Hey, Maz. Where's my boyfriend? - Chewie's working in the Falcon. - I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it. I'll be back. Resistance spotted... and your lost droid is here too. Inform the First Order... I found the droid. Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. The Supreme Commander senses it. Show me again. The power of the darkness. And I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me... ... Grandfather. And I will finish what you started. A map... to Skywalker himself? I need you to get this droid to Leia. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han. Go home. Leia doesn't want to see me. Please, we came here for your help. What fight? The only fight against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadows spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us. There is no fighting against the First Order. Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized us already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right... What's this? What are you doing? Solo, what is she doing? I don't know, but it ain't good. If you live long enough, you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. You don't know the First Order like I do. They will slaughter us. We all need to run. Hm. You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Finn? Come with me. What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base. You think? He can't. I can't. Keep it, kid. Who's the girl? - What? What is it? - Let him speak first. I was told you can get me to the Outer Rim. What are you doing? Don't leave without me. You can't just go. I won't let you. I'm not who you think I am. - Finn, what are you talking about? - I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. Like all of them, I was taken from my family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing. In my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran, right into you. You looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But, I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me. Don't go. Take care of yourself. Please. No! No! No! Come back! No! Come back! Come back! No! No! His energy... No! Come back! Quiet, girl. No! Rey? These are your first steps. What was that? I shouldn't gone in here. That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him. And now, it call's to you. I have to get back to Jakku. Han told me. Dear child, I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whoever you're waiting for in Jakku. They're never coming back. But, there's someone who still could. Luke. The belonging you seek is not behind you, it is ahead. I'm no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it . The light... it's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it. I'm never touching that thing again. I don't want any part of this. Today is the end of the Republic. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder. At this very moment in a system far from here, the New Republic lies to the galaxy while secretly supporting the treachery of the rogues of the Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate, to their cherished fleet. All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! and will remember this as the last day of the Republic! Confirm transfer to manual control. Configure ! Fire! Hosnian System New Republic Oh. What is it? That was New Republic. The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey? Mistress, are you alright? What are you doing? I see you running, are you alright? You have to go back. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - BB-8... - No. No, you can't. You have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. I had this for ages. I kept it locked away. Where'd you get that? A good question, for another time. Take it. Find your friend! Those beasts. They're here. FN-417, hold position. Oh, safety. Wow! Sir. The droid was spotted heading west. With a girl. You have to keep going, stay out of sight. - I'll try to fight them off. - I hope they wont find us. I hope so too. Come on, Chewie! Rey and BB-8! They need you! Now! Go! I need a weapon! You have one! Hey. Can I try that? I like this thing. Traitor! - You okay, \"Big deal\"? - Thanks. Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody. We have incoming in 28.6. Move! Move! Move! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Take cover and cover our mid field position! It's the Resistance. Go straight ahead at them! Don't let these thugs scare you! - Copy that. - We're with you, Poe. Quick! Yeah! That's one hell of a pilot! The girl I heard so much about. The droid. Where is it? We're going to need air support. The map. You've seen it. Sir, Resistance fighters. We need more troops. Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need. Fall back! No! No! No, no! No! No! Rey! He took her. Did you see it? He took her. She's gone. Yeah, yeah, I know. Come on. Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, C-3PO. You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. Look who it is! Did you see who...? Oh. Eh. Excuse me, Princess... General. I'm sorry. - Come on, BB-8, they're waiting. - What an unusual arm you have. Yes, I must have my proper arm reinstall. You changed your hair. Same jacket. No, new jacket. I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Hey! Poe! BB-8, my friend. Good to see you. Finn saved you? Where is he? There. Poe. Poe Dameron, you're alive? Why... - so are you! - What happened? What happened, I was throw from the crash. I woke up at night; no you, no ship, nothing - BB-8 says that you saved him. - No, no, no. It wasn't just me. You completed my mission, Finn... That's my jacket. - Oh. - No no no... Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn. Poe, I need your help. PZ-4CO, report to communications. General Organa. I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn. - He needs to talk to you. - And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life. Thank you, ma'am. But a friend of mine was taken prisoner. Han told me about the girl. I'm sorry. Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system, he worked on the base. We're just good for anything you can tell us. That's where my friend was taken. I got to get there fast. And I will do everything I can to help, but first you need to tell us all you know. That sounds very scary. You must be so brave. General, I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke. We are so foolish to think I could find Luke and bring him home. Leia. Don't do that. Do what? Anything. Princesses. I'm trying to be helpful. When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star. R2, I need your help. Wake up, R2. BB-8. You're wasting your time. He might have the map. It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. - Can't we wake him? - I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his own self again. Poor R2. Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... Every time you look me, you're reminded of him. Do you think I want to forget him? I want him back. There's nothing more we could have done There's too much Vader in him. That's why I wanted him to be trained with Luke. I just never should had sent him away, thats when I lost him. That's when I lost you both. We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was only good at. We both did. We lost our son. Forever. No. It was Snoke. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You. If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I? Luke is a Jedi. You're his father. There's still light in him, I know it. General. The reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. Where am I? You're my guest. Where are the others? Do you mean the murderers, traitors and thieves, you called friends? You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea. You still want to kill me. That happens when you're being haunting by a contort mask. Tell me about the droid. He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator... Carrying a section of a navigation chart. We have the rest. Recovered from the archives of the Empire, but we need the last piece. Yet somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you. You, a scavenger. You know I can take whatever I want. You're so lonely. So afraid to leave. At night, desperate to sleep. Imagine an ocean. I see it. I see the island. And Han Solo. You feel like he's a father you never had. He would have disappointed you. Get out of my head! I know you've seen the map. It's in there. And now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. I'm not giving you anything. We'll see. You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader! This scavenger resisted you! She is strong with the Force. Untrained, but stronger than she knows. And the droid? Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. That the girl, is all we needed. As a result, the Droid is most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already. Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance team to the Ileenium System. Good. Then we will crash them once and for all. Prepare the weapon. Supreme Leader, I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance. If what you say about this girl is true... Bring her to me. You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open. What did you say? You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open. I will tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open. I will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open. And you'll drop your gun. And I'll drop my gun. No. Guards! Guards! Begin charging the weapon. Yes, sir. Weapon charging. The scan Data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report. They somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. A laser cannon? We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. It's another Death Star. I wish that were the case, Major. This was the Death Star. And this, is Starkiller base. So, it's big. How is it possible to power up a weapon of that size? They uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charge, the sun is drained until it disappears. Ma'am. The First Order charging their weapon again, now. Our system is the next charge. Oh, my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doom. Okay. How do we blow it up? - There is always a way to do that. - Han's right. In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator. There is one. Precinct 47. Here. If we can destroy that oscillator, it might destabilize the core and cripple the weapon. Maybe the planet. We'll go in there, we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. We disable the shields. Kid, you worked there. - What do you got? - I can do it. I like this guy. I can seal the shields, but I have to be there, on the planet. - We'll get you there. - Han, how? If I told you, you wouldn't like it So, we disable the shields, we take out the oscillator and we blow up the big gun. Alright, let's go! Chewie, check that thermal capitator. Come on, let's go! Hey, be careful with those. They're explosives. Now, you tell me? You know? No matter how much we fought, I always hated watching you leave. That's why I did it So you'd miss me. I did miss you. It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was... good. Pretty good. Some things never change. True. You still drive me crazy. If you see our son, bring him home. Sir. Sensors triggered in Hanger 718. We're searching the area. She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. How're we getting in? Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. It keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. We're making our landing approach at lightspeed? Chewie, get ready. And... Now! I am pulling up! I get any higher, they'll see us! Sir, she was not found in hanger 718, but all troops are on alert. Put every hanger on lockdown. She's going to try to steal a ship to escape. Han Solo. The flooding tunnel is over that ridge. We'll get in that way. What was your job when you were based here? Sanitation. Sanitation? And how do you know how to disable the shields? I don't. I'm just here to get Rey. People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us. Solo, we'll figure it out. We'll use the force. That's not how the Force works. I'm cold. Oh, really? You're cold? Come on. Report. Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir. Hey! The longer we're here, the less luck we're going to have. - The shields. - I have an idea about that. AH! - Do you remember me? - FN-2187 Not any more. The name's Finn and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge. - Bring it down. Bring it down. - Okay. Follow me. You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields. You're making a big mistake. Do it. Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey. Don't worry, kid. We won't leave here without her. You can't be so stupid just to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all. I disagree. What do we do with her? Is there a garage chute? Trash compactor? There is. General, their shields are down. Thank the maker! Han did it! Send them in. Give Poe full authorization for attack. Black leader, go to sublight speed formation. Roger, base. Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead. Dropping out of lightspeed. Almost in range! Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get. Approaching target. Fighters incoming! Shields up! Shields up! Dispatch all squadrons. Yes, General. Alright, let's light it up! Ha! Direct hit! But no damage. Yeah, we got to keep hitting it. Another bombing run. Remember, when the sun is gone, their weapon will be ready to fire. But as long as there is light, we got a chance. - Master Poe, enemy fighters! - Guys, we got a lot of company! We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'm going in and draw fire but I'm going to need you to cover. You sure you are up for this? Hell, no. I'll go in and try to find Rey. The troopers will be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. Oh, there's an access tunnel that leads... Why're you do that? Hm. Why're you doing this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. - Ah! - No! Are you alright? - Yeah. - Good. What happened to you? Did he hurt you? - Finn, what are you doing here? - We came to get you. What did he say? He says it was your idea. Thank you. How did you get away? I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it. Escape now, hug later I got one behind me. - You see it? - Yeah. I'm on it. Watch out for ground fire. They're in trouble. We can't leave. My friend's got a bag full of explosives. Let's use them. General, are you seeing this? Two more X-wing's down. That's half our fleet destroyed. And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes. It would take a miracle to save us now. That girl knows her stuff. Let's set the charges against every other column. You're right. That's a better idea. You take the top. I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here. Find them. Ben! Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Take off that mask. You don't need it. What do you think you'll see if I do? The face of my son. Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish like his father, so I destroyed him. That's what Snoke wants you to believe, but it's not true. My son is alive. No. The Supreme Leader is wise. Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you. You know it's true. It's too late. No, it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Yes. Anything. (The light!) NO!!! Thank you. The oscillator's been damaged, but it's still functional. Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes. The Falcon's this way. We not done yet. You're a monster! It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. Rey! Hold on. Rey. Rey. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Rey. Traitor! That lightsaber... belongs to me. Come and get it. We just lost Star-1. We are overwhelmed. What are we doing? It isn't working. Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in. Red-4, Red-6, Cover us. - I'm on it. - Roger. Everybody else, get your target on. Give it everything you got. I need some help here. I need some help! - Coming in. - Watch out! I'm hit! All teams. I'm going in. Pull up and cover me. Copy that, Black leader. Good luck, Poe. The weapon will be fully charged in 30 seconds. Prepare to fire. You need a teacher! I can show you the ways to the Force! The Force. Lieutenant! Get back to your station! Just look! We won't survive, even Hux is gone! Supreme Leader. The fuel cells erupted. The collapse of the planet has begun. Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. It's time to complete his training. Finn. Finn! Finn. (Chewie.) All teams, I got eyes on them. Yes! Our job's done here. Let's go home. Easy. Easy. He's hurt. We got a heartbeat. How are you? You are awake! R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? How dare you call me that! We have to find Master Luke. - Find Master Luke, how? - I have a map. Come, R2, we must go tell the others at once! General. Excuse me, General. R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news. Tell me. Poe, I need your map. Yeah? Alright, buddy, hold on. Ha! The map, it is complete. Luke. Oh, my dear friend, how I missed you. We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend. Rey. May the Force be with you.\n                    "}, "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story": {"transcript": "\n\n                        A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.... - Mama. - We know. Jyn, gather your things, it's time. Hello. Saw, it's Lyra. It's happened. He's come for us. You know what to do. Jyn, come here. Remember, whatever I do, I do it to protect you. Say you understand. I understand. - I love you, Stardust. - I love you too, Papa. Galen. Go. Jyn. You know where to go, don't you? Trust the force. You're a hard man to find, Galen. But farming? Really, a man of your talents? It's a peaceful life. It's lonely, I imagine. Since Lyra died, yes. Oh. Oh. My condolences. Search the house! Understood. What is it you want? The work has stalled, I need you to come back. I won't do it, Krennic. We're on the verge of greatness. We were this close to providing peace, security for the galaxy. You're confusing peace with terror. Do I, huh? You have to start somewhere. I'll be of no help, Krennic. My mind just isn't what it was. I have trouble remembering, even simple things. Galen, you're an inspired scientist but you're a terrible liar. Now I admire the effort, I really do. Oh look, here's Lyra back from the dead. It's a miracle. Stop! Oh, Lyra. Troublesome as ever. You're not taking him. No, of course I'm not. I'm taking you all. You'll all come. You, your child, - You'll all live in comfort. - As hostages. As 'heroes of the Empire.' Lyra. Put it down. Think very carefully. - You will never win. - Do it. Lyra! No! They have a child. Find it! My child. Come. Come. We have a long ride ahead of us. ROGUE ONE Check in, security. Cell block 4227 - I was about to leave. - I came as fast as I could. I have to get back on board. - Walk with me. - Back to Jedha? They'll leave without me! Easy. You have news from Jedha? Come on. An Imperial pilot, one of the cargo drivers. He defected yesterday. He's telling people they're making a weapon. The kyber crystals, that's what they're for. What kind of weapon? - Look, I have to go. - What kind of weapon? A planet killer. That's what he called it. A planet killer? Someone named Erso sent him. - Some old friend of Saw's. - Galen Erso? - Was it? - I don't know! They were looking for Saw when we left. - Who else knows this? - I have no idea! It's all falling apart. Saw's right, there're spies everywhere What's all this? Come on, let's see some scandocs. Yeah, of course. My gloves? No What've you done? Troopers down, section 9. Are you crazy? I'll never climb out of here. My arm... Get out of the way. Move! Move! Calm down. Calm down. We'll be all right. Is that him? He looks kind of different than I imagined. Okay, so you're-you're Saw Gerrera? Saw Gerrera. No? Okay, we're just wasting time that we don't have. I need to speak to Saw Gerrera! I keep telling them before, before it's too late. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. We need to get to Jedha City. What part of urgent message do you guys not understand? Hey! we're all on the same side, if you just see past the uniform for a minute I've got to speak to ah... I've got to speak to Saw Gerrera. What now? I don't know. Must be another pick up. I thought we had everybody. -All clear, sir. - Hallik! - Liana Hallik! - Her. You want to get out of here? Hey! What about me? Congratulations. You are being rescued Please do not resist. LU-28, report to maintenance level 4. You're currently calling yourself Liana Hallik. Is that correct? Possession of unsanctioned weapons, forgery of Imperial documents, aggravated assault, escape from custody, resisting arrest Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out who you really were. Jyn Erso? That's your given name, is it not? Jyn Erso? Daughter of Galen Erso. A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development. What is this? It's a chance for you to make a fresh start. We think you might be able to help us. This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence. When was the last time you were in contact with your father? 15 years ago. Any idea where he's been all that time? I like to think he's dead, makes things easier. Easier than what? That he's being a tool of the Imperial war machine? - I've never had the luxury of political opinions. - Really? When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera? It's been a long time. He'd remember you, though, wouldn't he? He might agree to meet you, if you came as a friend. We're up against the clock here, girl, So if there's nothing to talk about, we'll just put you back where we found you. I was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me. But I've no idea where he is. I haven't seen him in years. We know how to find him, that's not our problem. What we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed. You're all rebels, aren't you? Yes, but Saw Gerrera's an extremist. He's been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust. What does this have to do with my father? There's an Imperial defector in Jedha. A pilot. He's being held by Saw Gerrera. He's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets. The pilot says he was sent by your father. We need to stop this weapon before it is finished. Captain Andor's mission is to authenticate the pilot's story and then, if possible, find your father. It appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon. Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw, we're hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony. And if I do it? We'll make sure you go free. Captain Andor! I'm Kay-Tuesso (K-2SO) I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid. I remember you. I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha. Apparently so. That is a bad idea. I think so, and so does Cassian. What do I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis. Galen Erso is vital to the Empire's weapon program. Forget what you heard in there, there will be no extraction. You find him, you kill him. Then and there. You met Kay-Tu? Charming. He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits. It's a by-product of the reprogram. Why does she get a blaster, and I don't? - What. - I know how to use it. That's what I'm afraid of. Give it to me. We're going to Jedha. That's a war zone. That's not the point. - Where did you get it? - I found it. I find that answer vague and unconvincing. Trust goes both ways. You're letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? - It's high. - Let's get going. It's very high. Lies! Deceptions! Let's see it. Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot. - Local boy, huh? - Uh-huh. Okay, I can hear you. He didn't capture me, I came here myself. I defected, I defected. Every day, more lies. Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie? No, we don't have time for this! I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it's too late. Okay... So, you... Um. Uh. That's-That's for you. And I gave it to them, they did not find it! I gave it to them. Galen Erso. He told me to find you. Bor Gullet. Bor Gullet? Galen Erso sent me! He told me to find you! Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha, Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays, and now this. We've heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project, countless systems will flock to the Rebellion. When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin, the Senate will be of little concern. When has become now, Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay, you have made time an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience. I will not fail. What's the matter, Jyn? You looked frightened. I'll always protect you. Stardust. Don't ever change. Trust... Galen. We're coming into orbit. You have controls. That's Jedha. Or what's left of it. We find Saw, we find your father. What's with the Destroyer? It's because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera. He's been attacking the cargo shipments. What are they bringing in? It's 'what are they taking out?' Kyber crystal. All they can get. We wondered why they were stripping the temple, now we know. It's the fuel for the weapon. The weapon your father's building. Maybe we should leave target practice behind. Are you talking about me? She's right. We need to blend in. Stay with the ship. I can blend in. I'm an Imperial droid. This city is under Imperial occupation Half the people here want to reprogram you. The other half want to put a hole in your head. I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety. I'm not. I'm just worried they might miss you and hit me. Doesn't sound so bad to me. Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts, No lie is safe. What have you really brought me, cargo pilot? Bor Gullet will know the truth. The unfortunate side effect, - is that one tends to lose one's mind. - No. Hey, you just watch yourself. No, no. Tourist, we don't want any trouble, sorry. Come on. Come on. Citizens of Jedha, you must come forward with information of the location of this missing cargo pilot. A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded. I had a contact, one of Saw's rebels, but he's just gone missing. His sister will be looking for him. The temple's been destroyed but she'll be there waiting. We'll give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw. Hope? Yeah. Rebellions are built on hope. Hands where I can see them. Get over there. Show me some identification. Check inside. Is this all because of your pilot? May the Force of others be with you. - May the Force of others be with you. - Wait for me. May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you. Would you trade that necklace for a glimpse into your future? Yes, I'm speaking to you. I am Chirrut mwe. How did you know I was wearing a necklace? For that answer you must pay. What do you know of kyber crystals? My father, he said they powered the Jedi lightsabers. Jyn. Come on, let's go. The strongest stars have hearts of kyber. Let's go. We're not here to make friends. Who are they? The Guardians of the Whills. Protectors of the Kyber Temple. But there's nothing left to protect, so now they're just causing trouble for everybody. You seem awfully tense all of a sudden. We have to hurry. This townit's ready to blow. Citizens of the Empire, Imperial forces... Tell me you have a backup plan. Incoming. Put your guns down. Behind us. Looks like we found Saw's rebels. Jyn, no! Thank you. Hit the tower. Get out of there! Quickly, the kyber, get it. Here, take the kyber. Take the kyber. Come on! This way! Did you know that wasn't me? Of course! I thought I told you to stay on the ship You did, but I thought it was boring, and you were in trouble. There are a lot of explosions for two people blending in. Freeze right there... You're right, I should just wait on the ship. Halt! Stop right there! Where are you taking these prisoners? - These are prisoners. - Yes. Where are you taking them? I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison. - He's taking us to... - Quiet! And there's a fresh one if you mouth off again! - We'll take them from here. - That's okay. If you could just point me in the right direction, I can take them, I'm sure. - I've taken them this far - Hey, wait a second. - Take them away. - Wait! - Hey, droid. You can't take them away! You stay here. We need to check your diagnostics. Diagnostics? I'm capable of running my own diagnostics, thank you very much. Let them pass in peace! Let them pass in peace. The Force is with me, and I am with the Force. And I fear nothing, for all is as the Force wills it. Hey! Stop right there! He's blind. Is he deaf? I said: Stop right there! Is your foot all right? You almost shot me. You're welcome. Clear of hostiles! - One hostile! - He's with us! They're all right. Thanks. Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap. Go back to the ship. Wait for my call. Is he a Jedi? There are no Jedi here anymore. Only dreamers like this fool. The Force did protect me. I protected you. Can you get us to Saw Gerrera? Can't you see we are no friends of the Empire? Anyone who kills me or my friends will answer to Saw Gerrera, Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso. Are you kidding me? I'm blind! I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. You pray? I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. Really? I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. He's praying for the door to open. It bothers him, because he knows it is possible. Baze Malbus was once the most devoted Guardian of us all. I'm beginning to think the Force and I have different priorities. Relax, Captain. We've been in worse cages than this one. This is a first for me. There is more than one sort of prison, Captain, I sense that you carry yours wherever you go. Jyn. Is it really you? I can't believe it. Must be quite a surprise. Are we not still friends? The last time I saw you, you gave me a knife and loaded blaster and told me to wait in a bunker until daylight. I knew you were safe. You left me behind. You were already the best soldier in my cadre. - I was sixteen. - I was protecting you! You dumped me! You were the daughter of an Imperial science officer! People were starting to figure that out. People who wanted to- to use you as a hostage. Not a day goes by that I don't think of you But today, of all days? It's a trap, isn't it? What? The pilot! The message. All of it. Did they... send you? Did you come here to kill me? There's not much of me left. The Alliance wants my father. They think he's sent you a message about a weapon. I guess they think by sending me you might actually help them out. So what is it that you want, Jyn? They wanted an introduction, they've got it. I'm out now. The rest of you can do what you want. You care not about the cause? The cause? Seriously? The Alliance? The... The rebels? Whatever it is you're calling yourself these days? All it's ever brought me is pain. You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy? It's not a problem if you don't look up. I have something to show you, come. The Emperor is awaiting my report. One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion. And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment. Your concern is hardly warranted. If saying it would only make it so. All Imperial forces, have been evacuated, and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon. That won't be necessary. We need a statement, not a manifesto. The Holy City will be enough for the day. Target Jedha City, prepare single reactor ignition. - Sir, we're in position, ready to... - Fire! Commence primary ignition. Who's the one in the next cell? What? Where? An Imperial pilot. - Pilot? - I'm going to kill Kim! - No, no, No, wait! - Come here! NO! Back off. Back off. Okay. Are you the pilot? Hey, heyare you the pilot? The shuttle pilot? Pilot? What's wrong with him? Galen Erso. You know that name? I brought the message, I'm the pilot. I'm the pilot. I'm the pilot. Okay, good. Now where is Galen Erso? Standby. This is the message I was sent. Saw, if you're watching this, then perhaps there is a chance to save the Alliance. Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and, though I don't dare hope for too much, a chance for Jyn, if she's alive, if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I've missed her. Jyn, my Stardust, I can't imagine what you think of me. When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths. I was told that, soon enough, Krennic would have you as well. As time went by, I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work, if I took my own life, it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable, and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I've placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful, they'll never find it. But, Jyn. Jyn, if you're listening My beloved, so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I'm strong, because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It's just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw, the reactor module, that's the key. That's the place I've laid my trap. It's well hidden and unstable, one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station. You'll need the plans, the structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor. I know there's a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station... Go. Go. K-2? K-2, where are you? There you are. I'm standing by as you requested. Although there's a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon. Locate our position. Bring that ship in here now! Where are you going? I've got to find Jyn. - Get the pilot. We need him. - All right. I'll get the pilot. Pilot. No, no, no. Let's go. Jyn! We've got to go. I know where your father is. Go with him, Jyn. You must go. - Come with us. - I will run no longer. - Come on. - But you must save yourself. - Come on. - Go! There's no time! Save the Rebellion! Save the dream! Oh. It's beautiful. Chirrut, let's go! Come on! Let's get out of here! Get us out of here! Punch it! - I'm not very optimistic about our role. - Let's not, K Come on! - Punch it. - I haven't completed my calculation. I'll make them for you. I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations. And you'll tell the Emperor as much? I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion. That was only an inkling of it's destructive potential I will tell him, that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of years ago effective immediately. We stand here amid my achievementnot yours! I'm afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director. The breaches have been filled, Jedha has been silenced. You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso's facility. We'll see about this. A coded message from Captain Andor, sir. Weapon confirmed. Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise. Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance. Baze, tell me. All of it? The whole city? - Tell me. - All of it. Understood. Set a course for Eadu. Setting course for Eadu. Is that where my father is? I think so. So you're Galen's daughter. You know him? I'm Bodhi, the pilot. You brought the message. Yes, your father... He said I could get right by myself. He said I could make it right, if I was brave enough and listened to what was in my heart. Do something about it. Guess it was too late. It wasn't too late. Seems pretty late to me. No. We can beat the people who did this. My father's message, I've seen it. They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea there's a way to defeat it. You're wrong about my father. - He did build it. - Because he knew they'd do it without him. My father made a choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He's rigged a trap inside it That's why he sent you. To bring that message. Where is it? Where's the message? It was a hologram. You have that message, right? Everything happened so fast. Did you see it? You don't believe me. I'm not the one you've got to convince. I believe her. That's good to know. What kind of trap? You said your father made a trap. The reactor He's placed a weakness there. He's been hiding it for years. He said if you can blow the reactor- the module- the whole system goes down. You need to send word to the Alliance. I've done that. They have to know there's a way to destroy this thing. - They have to go to Scarif to get the plans. - I can't risk sending that. We're in the heart of Imperial territory. Then we'll find him. And bring him back, and he can tell them himself. Course set for Eadu, sir. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. 20 egress to the right. 10 degrees up. No, no, no, lower. Lower! Are you sure this is the way? They have landing trackers. They have patrol squadrons. You've got to stay in the canyon, keep it low. Watch your right! There's a 26% chance of failure. How much farther? I don't know. I'm not sure, I never really come this way, but we're close, we're close. I know that. - Well, now there's a 35% chance of failure. - I don't want to know, thank you. I understand. - Now! Put it down now! - The wind... If you keep going, you'll be right over the shuttle depot. - Watch out! - Hey! Hold on tight! We're coming down hard! - Try them again. - I am, sir. We... The signal's gone dead. Squadron up, target Eadu. How about now, check stabilizers? - Bodhi, where's the lab? - The research facility? Yeah. Where is it? It's just over the ridge. And that's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us? You are sure of that? Yes. We'll have to hope there's still an Imperial ship left to steal. Here's what we're doing. Hopefully, the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here. Bodhi, you're coming with me. We'll go up the ridge and check it out. I'm coming with you. No, your father's message, we can't risk it. You're the messenger. That's ridiculous. We all got the message. Everyone here knows it. One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down. That's how you said it. The whole system goes down. Get to work fixing our comms! All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we're up against. So, we're going to go very small and very carefully up the rise and see what's what. Let's get out of here. Does he look like a killer? No. He has the face of a friend. Who are you talking about? Captain Andor. Why do you ask that? What do you mean, does he look like a killer? The Force moves darkly near a creature that's about to kill. His weapon was in the sniper configuration. No, no, no... We got to go up. You can't see much from down there. This way. I'll be right behind you. Come on. Where are you going? I'm going to follow Jyn. Her path is clear. Alone? Good luck! I don't need luck, I have you! What are they doing? If Cassian comes back, we're leaving without them. You see Erso out there? We've come too far. Patience, my friend. That's him. That's him, Galen, in the dark suit. Get back down there, and find us a ride out of here. What are you doing? - You heard me. - You said we came up here just to have a look I'm here, I'm looking. Go. Hurry! Excellent news, Galen. The battle station is complete. You must be very proud. Proud as I can be, Krennic. Gather your engineers, I have an announcement. Is that all of them? - Yes. Gentlemen. One of you betrayed the Empire. One of you has conspired with a pilot to send messages to the Rebellion. And I urge that traitor step forward. Very well, I'll consider it a group effort, then. Ready! - No. - No, please. Aim... - and... - No, no. - fire! - Stop! Stop! Krennic, stop. It was me. It was me. They have nothing to do with it. Spare them. Fire! How do I know the weapon is complete? Let me share with you some details.. Cassian. Cassian, can you hear me? I'm here. You got it working. Affirmative yes, although we have a problem! There's an Alliance squadron approaching. - Clear the area! - No. No, no, no! Tell them to hold up! Jyn's on that platform! Jedha. Saw Gerrera. His band of fanatics. Their Holy City. The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone. You'll never win. Now where have I heard that before? Relay from Captain Andor. - General. - Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support. Alliance forces onsite. Please confirm. Get the squadron leader on, Get him on now! They're already engaged, sir. Dead No. Return fire! To your stations. Get our fighters in the air now! Father! - Go, go, go, go. - Fall back! Fall back! Director, we need to evacuate. Papa. Papa, it's me. It's Jyn. Jyn. Stardust. Papa. I've seen your message. The hologram, I've seen it. It must be destroyed I know. I know. We will. Jyn. Look at you. I've so much to tell you. Papa. No. No Papa Papa! Come on. Over there, take them down. Come on. - Jyn, we've got to go. Come on. - I can't leave him, Listen to me. He's gone. There's nothing you can do. Come on. - I can't leave him. - Come on! - Help me. - Move! Down! Come on. Come on. Well done. You're a Rebel now. Let's go, let's go. Come on, let's move! Come on, let's get out of here. Move, move, move. Okay, K-2, let's go. Copy that. - Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm. - Understood. You lied to me. You're in shock. You went up there to kill my father. You don't know what you're talking about. Deny it You're in shock, and looking for someplace to put it. - I've seen it before. - I bet you have. They know. You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone. I had every chance to pull the trigger. But did I? Did I? You might as well have. My father was living proof and you put him at risk. Those were Alliance bombs that killed him! I had orders! Orders that I disobeyed! - But you wouldn't understand that. - Orders? When you know they're wrong? You might as well be a stormtrooper. What do you know? We don't all have the luxury of deciding when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you? Some of us live it. I've been in this fight since I was 6 years old. You're not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it. You can't talk your way around this. I don't have to. Yavin Four! Make sure they know we're coming in with a stolen ship. Anybody else? My lord, Director Krennic has arrived. Director Krennic. Lord Vader. You seem unsettled. No. Just pressed for time. There're a great many things to attend to. My apologies. You do have a great many things to explain. I've delivered the weapon the Emperor requested I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable potential. Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked. It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test. You were not summoned here to grovel, Director Krennic. - No, I... - There is no Death Star. The Senate has been informed that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster. Yes, my lord. I expect you to not rest until you can assure the Emperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way. So I'm still in command? You'll speak to the Emperor about Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director. We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender. Are we really talking about disbanding something that we've worked so hard to create? - We can't just give in. - We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact! - We've only now managed to gather our forces. - Gather our forces? General Draven's already blown up an Imperial base! A decision needed to be made. If it's war you want, you'll fight alone! If that's the way it's going, why have an Alliance at all? If she's telling the truth, we need to act now! Councilors, please! It is simple, the Empire has the means of mass destruction. The Rebellion does not. A Death Star, this is nonsense. What reason would my father have to lie? What benefit would it bring him? To lure our forces into a final battle. To destroy us once and for all. To risk everything, based on what? The testimony of a criminal? The dying words of her father, an Imperial scientist? Don't forget the Imperial pilot. My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this. So you've told us. If the Empire has this kind of power, what chance do we have? What chance do we have? The question is 'What choice?' Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. - The time to fight is now! - Yes. Every moment you waste is another step closer to the ashes of Jedha. - What is she proposing? - Just let the girl speak! Send your best troops to Scarif. Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to. We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it. You're asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope? Rebellions are built on hope. There is no hope. I say we fight. I say the Rebellion is finished. I'm sorry, Jyn. Without the full support of the council, the odds are too great. General Bendola, please report to the briefing room. You don't look happy. - They prefer to surrender. - And you? - She wants to fight. - So do I. We all do. The Force is strong. I'm not sure four of us is quite enough. - How many do we need? - What are you talking about? They were never going to believe you. I appreciate the support. But I do. I believe you. We'd like to volunteer Some of us... ... most of us, we've done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion. We're spies. Saboteurs. Assassins. Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion. And every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in. A cause that was worth it. Without that, we're lost. Everything we've done would have been for nothing. I couldn't face myself if I gave up now. None of us could. It won't be comfortable. It'll be a bit cramped, but we'll all fit. We could go. Okay. Gear up. Grab anything that's not nailed down. Go, go, go! Jyn. I'll be there for you. Cassian said I had to. I'm not used to people sticking around when things go bad Welcome home. Bravo team to the Intelligence office for extraction mission report. May the Force be with us. Cargo shuttle, read back, please. What's going on out there? That ship's off limits. No one is suppose to be on board until farther instructions. Yes, yes we are. Affirmative. That's an impounded Imperial ship. What's your call sign, pilot? - Um. - We have to go. It-It's um... Say something. Come on. Rogue... Rogue One. Rogue One? There is no Rogue One. Well, there is now. - Rogue One, pulling away. - Pulling away. Despite what the others say, war is inevitable Yes, I agree. I must return to Alderaan to inform my people that there will be no peace. We will need every advantage. Your friend, the Jedi. He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor's purge. Yes, I will send for him. You'll need someone you can trust. I would trust her with my life. - Captain Antilles, I have a mission for you. - Senator. Okay, we're coming in. There's a planetwide defensive shield with a single main entry gate. This shuttle should be equipped with an access code that allows us through. Assuming, the Empire hasn't logged it as overdue. And if they have? Then,they shut the gate and we're all annihilated in the cold, dark vacuum of space. Not me, I can survive in space. Okay. Here it goes Cargo shuttle SW-0608 requesting a landing pad. Cargo shuttle SW-0608, you're not listed on the arrival schedule. Acknowledged, Gate Control. We were rerouted from Eadu Flight Station. - Transmitting clearance code now. - Transmitting. Cargo shuttle SW-0608? -You are cleared for entry. - Yes! Impressive. I'll tell the others. Okay. SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9. Acknowledge, please. SW-0608 proceeding to LP9 as instructed. The main building down there, what is it? That's the Citadel Tower. They keep all the Imperial structure archives in there. If the plans are anywhere, they'll be there. The dish at the top? What's it for? I guess it takes a lot of signals to send those data files out. Landing track engaged Landing track locked. We're landing. We're coming in! Saw Gerrera used to say, One fighter with a sharp stick and nothing left to lose can take the day. They have no idea we're coming. They have no reason to expect us. If we can make it to the ground, we'll take the next chance. And the next. On and on until we win... or the chances are spent. The Death Star plans are down there. Cassian, Kay-Tu, and I will find them. We'll find a way to find them. Melshi, Pao, Baze, Chirrut, you'll take main squad, move east and get wide of the ship. Find a position between here and the tower. Once you get to the best spot, light the place up. - Make ten men feel like a hundred. - All right. And get those troopers away from us. What should I do? Keep the engine running. You're our only way out of here. Cargo shuttle SW-0608, be prepared to receive inspection team. Ready? Hello. Hey, you're probably looking for a manifest That would be helpful. It's just down here. Director Krennic, we are entering the Scarif shield gate. General Ramda has been informed of your arrival. Good luck, little sister. Go! Go now, you're clear! All right, let's go. Come on. Move, move, move. I have a bad feeling about - Kay! - Quiet. What? We need a map. Well, I'm sure there's one just lying about. You know what you have to do. One per pad. Pick your spot. We want to draw them out. I'll call the timing. Go! Hey, did you hear the rumors? Yeah, the T-15s have been marked obsolete. Oh boy, it's about time for that. - Hey. - Watch out. What the...? Director, what brings you to Scarif? Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission he has ever sent called up for inspection. All of them? Yes. All of them. Get started. Kay? Our optimal route to the data vault places only 89 stormtroopers in our path. We will make it no more than 33% of the way before we are killed. Melshi, talk to me. Ready, ready. Standing by. Light it up. Are we blind? Deploy the garrison! Move! Troopers! Troopers. Troopers on the left! Sir? Scarif base, they're reporting a rebel incursion. I want to speak to Director Krennic. He's there, sir. On Scarif. The original plans for this station are kept there, are they not? They are. Prepare for the jump to hyperspace and inform Lord Vader. Can I help you? That won't be necessary. Senator! Senator. Stop right there, Private. Let him speak. Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma'am. Rebels on Scarif. I need to speak to Admiral Raddus He's returned to his ship He's gone to fight. No! Attention all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately. Attention all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately. We have been redirected to Scarif. Pilots, you'll be briefed by you squadron leaders on route. May the Force be with you. Scarif? They're going to Scarif? - Why does nobody ever tell me anything, Artoo? - Yeah, nobody tells us anything. Fall back! Fall back! Keep drawing them out! - Go. Go. - Move. Move. Come on, move up! Pad 12 report to ground. Coming at our flank, we're outnumbered. Pad 12 team, what's going on down there. Status, please. All Pads report in immediately. Unknown, we have rebels everywhere. We're taking fire, Pad 12, Pad 14 request assistance. This is Pad 2, Pad 2. I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2. Get on there, tell him pinned down by rebels on Pad 5. This is Pad 5, we're being overrun. Help us! Pad 12, Pad 10, Pad 8, please confirm. Confirm and report. Get reinforcements down to Pad 5 immediately! This is not working, Kay. Right hand. Baze! - Baze! - What? Run! Retreat. Retreat! This is Admiral Raddus of the Rebel Alliance. All Squadron leaders report in. Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by. This is Gold Leader, standing by. This is Red Leader, standing by. Sir, those are rebel ships. Get Admiral Gorin, immediately. Director, the rebel fleet, it's amassing outside the shield. Lock down the base. Lock down. - And close the shield? - Do it! Red and Gold squadron, attack formations. Defend the fleet. Blue squadron, get to the surface before they closed that gate. Copy, your Admiral. Blue squadron, on me. - Copy, Blue Leader. - Copy, Blue Leader. We won't have long. Close the field. Close it! Come on, come on, come on! Pull up! - Rebel fleet has arrived. - What? There's fighting on the beach, they've locked down the base, - they've closed the shield gate. - What does that mean? We're trapped? We could transmit the plans to the rebel fleet. We'd have to get a signal out to tell them it's coming. It's the size of the data files. That's the problem. They'll never get through. Someone has to take that shield gate down. Bodhi. Bodhi, can you hear me? Bodhi, tell me you're out there. Bodhi! Hello, I'm here. We're standing by. They've started fighting, the base is on lockdown! I know, listen to me! The rebel fleet is up there. You've got to tell them to blow a hole in the shield gate so we can transmit the plans Wait, I can't. I'm not hooked into the comm tower. We're not tied in. It's the only way we're getting them out of here. Find a way! Cover our backs. You'll need this. You wanted one, right? Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected. Jyn. Come on. Fire on my command. Look! Get ready. We're going to have to go out there. What're you doing? They closed the shield gate, we're stuck here. But, the rebel fleet is pulling in. We just have to get a signal strong enough to get through to them and let them know we're trapped down here. For that, we have to connect to the communications tower. Now, I can patch us in over here, the landing pad but you have to get on the radio, get one of the guys out there to find a master switch. Get them to activate the connection between us and that comm tower. Okay. Then go! What's going on down there, Lieutenant? Unknown, sir. We can't raise them. All rebel frequencies are blocked. Keep trying. Engage those Star Destroyers and let's start probing that shield. Yes, sir. We're going in. Stay with me. Schematics bank, Data tower two. - How do I find that? - Searching. I can locate the tape, but you'll need the handles for extraction. What are we supposed to do with these? Whoa. - Well, finally. - Wait, stop. The rebels! They wentover there. Kay. What's going on out there? There's one. Oh well. Come on! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader, we're starting our attack run on the shield gate. Keep it tight and watch out for those towers. More fighters. Form up, at 65. Sir, enemy fighters coming in. Melshi. Melshi, come in, are you there? Bodhi will send a signal from here. He's patching us in. But you guys have to open up a line for the tower. How? Please advise. There's a master switch to the base of the Comm tower. Master switch, describe, what are we looking for? What does it look like, the master switch? Where is it? Two wings, reinforce those troops on the beach. All fighters, on me. We have to shield them from air attack. Troop reinforcements. Here we go. - For Jedha! - Jedha! We have no effect on that shield. How much more can that thing take? Stick close, Red 5, where are you going? I'm trying to lose them. This is Red 5, I need help! Hyperspace Tracking, Navigational Systems. Two screens down. Structural Engineering, open that one! I got one on my tail. I'm on it. Project code names: Stellarsphere. Mark Omega. Pax Aurora War-Mantle. Cluster-Prism. Black-Saber. What? Stardust. That's it. How do you know that? I know because it's me. Hey, you. Identify yourself. I can explain. Incoming fire, take cover! Kay, we need the file for Stardust! Stardust. That's it. Kay. Climb. Climb. You can still send the plans to the fleet. If they open the shield gate, you can broadcast from the tower! - Locking the bolt door now. - Kay. Kay! - Good bye. - Kay! Sir, unauthorized access at the data vault. - What. - It's just come in, sir. Send my guard squadron into battle! Two men with me now! Get that beach under control! Bodhi? Are you there? Have you got the switch? I can't get to the shuttle, I can't plug in! You have to! They have to hit that gate. If the shield's open, we can send the plans! General, behind you! Take them out. Step back. We're going down! Come on! Look out. Melshi. Melshi, come in please. I'm tied in at my end, I just need an open line. Hang on. The master switch, it's over at that console. I'm going! I've got it. Careful! You okay? Jyn! I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. Chirrut! I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. Chirrut, come back! Yes! Keep going. Keep going! Cassian. Chirrut, come! Come with me! Chirrut! Chirrut, don't go. Don't go. I'm here. I'm here. It's okay. It's okay. - Look for the Force, - Chirrut. and you will always find me. The Force is with me. I'm one with the Force. The Force is with me. I'm one with the Force. The Force is with me. and I'm one with the Force. Deflector shield's down to 50%, we're sustaining heavy damage. There's no turning back now, we have to press the attack. Hit that opening. We see it, Gold Leader. Ion torpedoes away. - What's happening? - We've lost engine power, sir. That Star Destroyer is disabled. This is Rogue One, calling any Alliance ships that can hear me! Is there anybody up there? This is Rogue One! Come in, over. This is Admiral Raddus, Rogue One, we hear you! We have the plans! They found the Death Star plans. They have to transmit them from the communications tower! You have to take down the shield gate. It's the only way to going to get them through! Call up a Hammerhead corvette. I have an idea. - Standby, Rogue One, we're on it. - This is for you, Galen, The Force is with me. I'm one with the Force. Corvette 5, locked on target. Prepare for impact. Sublight thrusters, full power! Reset antenna alignment. Reset antenna alignment. Reset antenna alignment. Reset antenna alignment. Reverse engines, full power! Antenna alignment. Ready to transmit. Who are you? You know who I am. I'm Jyn Erso. Daughter of Galen and Lyra. You've lost. Oh, I have, have I? My father's revenge. He built a flaw in the Death Star. He put a fuse in the middle of your machine and I've just told the entire galaxy how to light it. The shield is up, your signal will never reach the rebel base. All you ships in here will be destroyed. I lose nothing but time. YOU on the other hand die with the Rebellion. Transmitting. Transmitting. Admiral, receiving transmission from Scarif. Hey, leave it. Leave it. That's it. That's it. Let's go. Transmission received. Admiral, we have the plans! She did it. Do you think, anybody is listening? I do. Someone's out there. Sir, we're detecting a massive object emerging from hyperspace. Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet? Lord Vader will handle the fleet. Target the base at Scarif. Single reactor ignition Yes, sir. You may fire when ready. Commence primary ignition. Rogue One, may the Force be with you. All ships, prepare for jump to hyperspace! You father would have been proud of you, Jyn. The rebel flag ship is disabled, my lord, but has received transmission from the surface. Prepare a boarding party. Yes, my lord. Hurry! Let go! We got to go now. Hurry, let's go. It's stuck. Hey, help! Open fire! Help us! It's jammed. Push! Here. Here. Take it! Take it. LAUNCH! Make sure you secure the airlock. And prepare the escape pods. Your Highness. The transmission we received. What is it they've sent us? Hope.\n                    "}, "Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi": {"transcript": "\n\n                        We're not clear yet! there's still 30 pallets of cannon shells in C bunker. Forget the ammunition, there's no time. Just get everyone on the transport. Oh no. We've caught them in the middle of their evacuation. I have my orders from Supreme Leader Snoke himself. This is where we snuff-out the resistance once and for all. Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought. Incenerate their base, destroy their transports and obliterate their fleet. General, resistance ship approaching. Launching shields in attack mode. A single light fighter? Happy beeps here, buddy, come on. We've pulled crazier stunts than this. Just for the record, Commander Dameron, I'm with the droid on this one. Thank you for your support, General. Happy beeps. Attention! This is Commander Poe Dameron of the Republic fleet, I have an urgent communique for General Hux. Patch him through This is General Hux of the First Order. The Republic is no more. your fleet are rebel scum and war criminals Tell your precious princess there will be no terms... there will be no surrender. Hi, I'm holding for General Hux. This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed! We will wipe your filth from the galaxy. Okay; I'll hold. Hello? Hello? Yup. I'm still here. Can you- can he hear me? - Hux? - He can? With an 'H'? Skinny guy. Kinda pasty? I can hear you. Can you hear me? Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him... Tell him Leia has an urgent message for him. I believe he's tooling with you, sir. About his mother. Open fire! BB-8, punch it! He's going for the dreadnought. He's insane. Yuhuu! That's got a kick. All right, taking out the cannons now. Tallie, start your approach. Copy that. Captain Canady, why aren't you blasting that puny ship? That 'puny ship' is too small and at close range. We need to scramble our fighters! Five bloody minutes ago. He'll never penetrate our armor. He's not trying to penetrate our armor. He's clearing out our surface cannons. There's one cannon left. And here comes the parade. Yeah, yeah, I see 'em! No no. Dammit! BB-8, my weapon systems are down. We gotta take out that last cannon... or our bombers are toast. Make your magic work, buddy. Are the auto cannons primed? Primed and ready, sir. What are we waiting for? Fire on the base! Punch it! The last transport is in the air, the evacuation is complete. You did it, Poe. Now get your squad back here so we can get out of this place. No, General... We can do this. We have... a chance to take down a dreadnought. These things are fleet killers. We can't let it get away. Disengage now... Commander, that is an order... Wipe that nervous expression off your face, 3PO. Well, I'll certainly try, General. Nervous? Let's go, BB-8... It's now or never! Yeeeaaahh-ho! All clear, bring the bombs! Captain... Resistance bombers approaching. Of course they are. Bombers, keep that tight formation. Fighters, protect the bombers. It's not every day we get a shot at a dreadnught, so make this count. Copy that, Blue Leader. If you get us there, we'll give it to them. - copy that. - Fighters incoming. Gunners, look alive. Fighters at 2-10! - Are getting closer! - Form yourself! They are ever-ah! - Here they come. - Fighters arrive. Form yourself. Vector at attack speed. - Stand up! - Right side. Help! We're going down! Recharge the auto-cannons. Target their cruiser. I see. Tallie, they have targeted the fleet... begin the priming sequence. Copy that. We are almost there. Bombadiers... Begin your drop sequence. I've got a visual on the target. We are approaching the point of attack. The bombs are armed. Auto-cannons aimed. 40 seconds to for full charge. Destroy that last bomber! Paige, come in. We're over the target. Why aren't your bay doors open? You're the only bomber left. It's all down to you! - Nix! - Paige! Drop the payload, now! Look out! No! Bombs away! Direct hit! Dreadnought down! General, Supreme Leader Snoke... is making contact from the ship. Excellent. I'll take it in my chambers. General Hux. Ah, good. Supreme leade- My disappointment... in your performance can not be overstated. They can't get away, Supreme Leader. We have them tied on the end of a string. Rey! Well done, pal. \"Finn naked leaking bag\"? What? Did you fry a chip? Finn! Hey, buddy. It's so good to see you. What? Let's uh... We need to get you dressed. Come on. You must have a thousand questions. Where is Rey? Master Skywalker? Master Skywalker? I'm from the Resistance. Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help. Hello? Go away. Chewie, what are you doing here? He said you're coming back with us. How did you find me? Long story we'll tell you in the Falcon. Falcon? Wait. Where is Han? Tied to a string, indeed, General Hux. Well done. The Resistance will soon be in our grasp. Thank you, Supreme Leader. Do you wonder why I keep a rabid cur... In a such a place of power? The cur's weakness, properly manipulated... Can be a sharp tool. How's your wound? It's nothing. The mighty Kylo Ren. When I found you... I saw what all masters live to see. Raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special. The potential of your bloodline. A new Vader. Now I fear... I was mistaken. Ive given everything I have to you To the dark side. Take that ridiculous thing off. Yes, there it is. You have too much of your father's heart in you, young Solo. I killed Han Solo. When the moment came I didn't hesitate. And look at you, the deed split your spirit to the bone. You were unbalanced... Bested by a girl who had never held a lightsaber! You failed! Skywalker lives. The seed of the Jedi Order lives. As long as it does... Hope lives in the galaxy. I thought you would be the one to snuff it out. Alas, you're no Vader. You're just a child... in a mask Prepare my ship. There is no light left in Kylo Ren. He's only getting stronger. The First Order will control all the major systems within weeks. We need your help. We need the Jedi Order back. We need Luke Skywalker. You don't need Luke Skywalker Did you hear a word I just said? -You think what? I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order? What did you think was going to happen here? Do you think that I came... To the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all? Go away. I'm not leaving without you! Careful! You are wasting your time. Who are you? I know this place. built a thousand generations ago... to keep these. The original Jedi texts. Just like me, they're the last of the Jedi religion. You've seen this place. You've seen this island. Only in dreams. Who are you? The Resistance sent me. they sent you? What is special about you? - Where are you from? - Nowhere. - No one's from nowhere. - Jakku. Allright, that is pretty much nowhere Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere? The Resistance sent me. We need your help. The first Order has become unstoppable. Why are you here? Something inside me has always been there Then now it's awake. And I'm afraid. I do not know what it is... or what to do with it. And I need help. You need a teacher. I can't teach you Why not? I've seen your daily routine. You're not busy. I will never train another generation of Jedi. I came to this island to die. It's time for the Jedi to end. Why? Leia sent me here with hope. If she was wrong, she deserves to know why. We all do. You're demoted. What? Wait! We took down a dreadnought. At what cost? If you start an attack, you follow through. Poe, get your head out of your cockpit. There are things you can not solve... By jumping into an X-wing and blowing something up! I need you to learn that. There were heroes on that mission. Dead heroes, No leaders. We're really nowhere. How's Rey going to find us now? A cloaked binary beacon? To light her way home. Alright, Well, until she comes back, what's the plan? We need to find a new base. One with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies. scattered in the Outer Rim. Proximity alert! They found us. That's impossible. It's Snoke's ship. You've gotta be kidding me. Can we jump to lightspeed? We have enough fuel for just one jump. Do it. We have to get out of here. Wait. They tracked us through lightspeed. That's impossible. Yes. And they've done it. So if we jump to lightspeed... they'll just find us again, and we'll be out of fuel. They've got us. Not yet, they don't. Permission to jump in an X-wing and blow something up? Permission granted. Admiral, spin us around! Reverse. Rotate the shields! To your posts! Move! Follow my lead Green squadron to launch position. Clear the launch traffic. Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up! Technicians, secure supplies for launch conditions. Move! Poe, are you alright? We have to get away from the Star Destroyers. We need to what? Full engines ahead. Get out of range of the Star Destroyers and the figthers will fall back. Full engines! Concentrate rear shields. Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of reach. We can't cover you at this distance. Return to the fleet. What is the point of all this? We can't blow up three tiny cruisers? They are faster and lighter, sir. They can't lose us but they can keep at a range where... that our cannons are not effective against their shields. Well, keep up the barrage. Let's at least let's remind them that we're still here. Very good sir. They won't last long burning fuel like this. It's just a matter of time. Move! Make way! Make room! Her vital signs are weak, but she is fighting. Artoo? Artoo! Yes. Yes I know. Hey, it's a sacred island, watch the language. Old friend. I wish I could make you understand. But I'm not coming back. Nothing can make me change my mind. Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. It hurts me not to be able to fulfill my father's request in person... That was a cheap move. But they are attacking my ship... and I fear that my mission to bring you to Alderaan failed. It is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Tomorrow at dawn. Three lessons. I will teach you the ways of the Jedi... and why they need to end. General Organa... Leia... Is unconscious but recovering. This is the only good news I have. Admiral Ackbar... all our leadership, they're gone. Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge. Oh God! If she were here, she'd say save your sorrow for after the fight. And to that end... The chain of command is clear as to who should take her place. Vice Admiral Holdo... of the cruiser Ninka. Thank you, Commander. There are four hundred of us... on three ships. We're the very last of the Resistance But we're not alone. In every corner of the galaxy... the downtrodden and oppressed know our symbol... and they put their hope in it. We are the spark that will ignite the fire that will restore the Republic. That spark... this Resistance, must survive. That is our mission. Now, to your stations. And may the Force be with us. That's Admiral Holdo? Battle of Chyron Belt, Admiral Holdo? Not what I expected. Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron. With our current fuel consumption... there is a very limited amount time... That we will stay out of range of those Star Destroyers. Very kind to make me aware. Leave those calculations to me. And we need to shake them before we find a new base, so... What's our plan? Our plan, captain? Not commander, right? Wasn't it Leia's last official act to demote you? Because of your dreadnought plan... Where we lost our entire bombing fleet? \"Captain.\" \"Commander.\" You can call me whatever you like. I just want to know what's going on. Of course you do. I understand. I've dealt with plenty of trigger happy flyboys like you... You are impulsive. Dangerous. And the last thing we need right now. So stick to your post... and follow my orders. Turbo-lifts seven and eight disconnected for maintenance. What are you doing here? Hey, hi. Uh, I was... Uh, you know... You are Finn! The Finn! - The Finn? - Sorry... I work behind pipes all day. Doing... Doing talking, yeah... I'm Rose. Breathe - Good. - Yes Yeah, look I'm not a Resistance hero, but... It was nice talking to you, Rose. May the Force be with you. Woah. You too. Good. But you are a hero. You left the First Order-what you did on the Starkiller Base. When we heard about it, my sister Paige said... \"Rose, that's a real hero.\" \"Know right from wrong.... \"and don't run away from when it gets hard,\" she said. You know... Just this morning, I had to stun... three people who were trying to jump ship. In this escape pod. What? They were running away. That's disgraceful. I know. Anyway, uh... I gotta get back to what I was doing, so. What were you doing? - Just, just, uh checks. - Checking the escape pods. No, it's routine checks. While boarding one... with a packed bag. Okay. Listen, I... I can't move. I can't move. - I know - What happened? I'm taking you to the bridge and turning you in for desertion. I was not deserting. - I told you that... - My sister just died... protecting the fleet. And you were running away. Sorry. This fleet is doomed... If my friend comes back to it, she's doomed too. I've gotta get this... I've gotta get this beacon very far away from here, then she'll find me and be safe. You're a selfish traitor. We cannot outrun the First Order fleets. We can jump to light speed Well they can track us through lightspeed. - They can track us through lightspeed? - Yeah. They'll just show up 30 seconds later and we'll have blown a ton of fuel. Of which, by the way, we're dangerously short of. - They can track us through lightspeed. - Yes. And they could... I can't feel my teeth. What did you shoot me with? Active tracking... What now? New hyperspace tracking... Hyperspace tracking is a new tactic but the principal must be the same as any active tracker. - So they're just tracking us... - Tracking us... - from the main ship. - from the main ship. But we can't get to the tracker. It is an A class process they'll controll from the main bridge. Yes, but all Class A process... - Has a dedicated power breaker - Power breaker. But... Who knows where the breaker room is on the Star Destroyer? I'm the guy who used to mop it. If I can get us there I can shut their tracker down. Just give it to me one more time, but simpler. So the First Order's only tracking us from one Destroyer, the main one. So we make blow that one up? I like where you're heading, but no. They'd only start tracking us from another Destroyer. If we sneak onboard into the main Destroyer and we turn off the tracker without them realizing, then we can... They won't realize if it's for one system cycle. About six minutes. Sneak on board. Disable the tracker Our fleet escapes before they even realize. How did you two meet? Just luck. Yeah? Good luck? Not sure yet. Poe, we've got to do this It will save the fleet and it'll save Rey. If I surely must be the voice of reason... Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan. Yeah, you're right, 3PO. It's a need to know plan, and she doesn't. - That was not exactly... - All right... You guys shut down that tracker. I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed. The question is... How do we sneak the two of you onto Snoke's destroyer? We'll steal clearance codes. No, they are Bio-Hexaencripted and rescrambled every hour. We can't get through their security shields undetected. Nobody can. Could I do it? Of course I could do it. But I can't do it, I'm a little tied down right now. Maz? What is happening? A union dispute, you do NO want to hear about it. But, lucky for you... There's exactly one guy I trust that can crush that kind of security. He is a master code breaker, an ace pilot... a poet with a blaster. Oh my. It seems that this code breaker can practically do everything. Oh yes, he can. You will find him with a red ploom flower on his lapel... rolling on a high stakes table... in the casino... on Canto Bight. - Canto Bight? - No, no. That's... Maz... Is there any way we can take care of this ourselves? I'm sorry, kiddo. This is rarified cracking. If you want to get on that Destroyer, I know only one option. Find the master code breaker. You will bring Luke Skywalker to me. You are not doing this, the effort would kill you. Can you see my surroundings? You are going to pay for what you did! I can't see yours. Just you. So no. This is something else. Luke. What's that about? I was cleaning my blaster-it went off. Let's get started. Who were those things? Caretakers. Island natives. They've kept up the Jedi structures since they've been built. I don't think they like me. I can't imagine why. Master Skywalker... We need you to bring the Jedi back... because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force. Without the Jedi, we won't stand a chance against him. What do you know about the Force? It's a power the Jedi have that lets them control people and... make things float. Impressive Every word in that sentence was wrong. Lesson one... Sit here, legs crossed. The Force is not a power you have. It's not about lifting rocks. It's the energy between all things. a tension, a balance... that binds the universe together. Okay. But what is it? Close your eyes. Breathe. Now... reach out. I feel something. - You feel it? - Yes. - It's the Force. - Really? Wow, it must be very strong with you. I've never felt anything... Aw! You said to reach out tho... I'll try again. Breathe. Just breathe. Reach out with your feelings. What do you see? The island. Life. Death and decay... that feeds the new life. Warm. Cold. Peace. Violence. And between it all? Balance. And energy... A force. And inside you? Inside me... the same Force. And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, it's vanity. Can you feel that? There's something else... benathe the island. A place. A dark place. Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness. It's cold. It's calling me. Resist it, Rey. Rey? Rey! You went straight to the dark. That place was trying to show me something. It offered you something you needed. And you didn't even try to stop yourself. But I didn't see you. Nothing from you. You closed yourself off from the Force. Of course you have. I've seen this raw strength only once before... in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now. What was that? Nothing, admiral. Passing debris. The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left. We gotta hurry. Still comming to the Resistance? Keep at it. If you reach them, check their status. And ask about Finn. Why is the Force connecting us? You and I. Murderous snake. You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened? The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why? I know everything I need about you. You do? Ah, you do. You have that look in your eyes. From the forest. When you call me a monster. You are a monster. Yes I am. Okay, we get in, find this code breaker and get out. Do you know this town? Canto Bight? From stories. It's a terrible place full of the worst people in the galaxy. Great. I told those two... I said, \"This is a public beach, you can't park that shuttle.\" But they just went off toward the casino. Place your bets. All the bets on the table, right now! Place your bets here. Oh, yes! This place is great! Okay. Maz says that this master decoder would have a red ploom on his lapel. Let's find him and get out of here. Well played... The house wins. - Rather, where are your manners old man? - Come on! We toured the entire casino. Zero ploom flower. Where is this guy? Are those what I think they are? What are those things? Fathiers. I've never seen a real one. This whole place is beautiful. Come on. Why do you hate it so much? Look closer. My sister and I grew up in a poor mining system. The First Order stripped our ore to finance its military... then shelled us to test their weapons. They took everything we had. And who do you think these people are? There is only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich. War. Selling weapons to the First Order. I wish... I could put my fist through this whole lousy beautiful town. A red ploom flower! A red ploom flower! The master code breaker! Eeyup, those are the shore parkers. Alright, You are arrested for parking violation 27B / 6. - They have the right... - What was that? No no. Not now, lovely. I'm on a roll. Lesson two. Now that they are extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, deified But if you strip away the myth and look a their deeds the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy, hubris. That's not true. At the height of their power, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise... Create the Empire and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master whose responsible... for the training and creation of Darth Vader. And the Jedi who saved him. Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy. But you saw that there was conflict inside him. You believed that he wasn't gone, that he could be turned. And I became a legend. For many years, there was balance... and then I saw... Ben. My nephew... with that mighty Skywalker blood. In my hubris... I thought I could train him, that I could pass on my strength. Han wasn't fond about it, but... Leia... trusted me with her son. I took him... and a dozen students... and began a training temple. By the time I realized I was no match for the darkness rising in him... It was too late. What happened? I went to confront him. And he turned on me. Ben, no! He must have thought I was dead. When I came to... the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke, but... It was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi master. A legend. The galaxy may need a legend. I need someone to show me my place in all this. And you didn't fail Kylo. Kylo failed you. I won't. The main cruiser's still keeping beyond range. But his medical frigate is out of fuel... And its shields are down. The beginning their end. Destroy it. The last of our crew has been evacuated and heading your way. It's been an honor, admiral. Good speed, Rebels! Admiral... fuel reserves at six hours. Maintain our current course. Steady on. Finn... Rose, where are you guys? Deal me in. Thanks. Finn, the fleet is running on fumes. Without a code breaker to sneak into Snoke's Star Destroyer... - What do we do? - I don't know. If you don't have a thief in your pocket, then our plan is shot. I can do it. What? What? What? Sorry, I'm just... I couldn't help but overhear the stuff you were saying really loudly... while I trying to sleep. Code breaker? Thief? I can do it. I'm not talking about picking pockets, okay? Aw, yeah. Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend... Me and the First Order codage, go way back. If the price is right... I could break you into Old Man Snoke's budoire. - No. - We... we've got it covered. - Did he just...? - Yeah. We gotta get outta here! This way! Why? Did you do this? Hey, hands up! Hands up! Yeah, man. What's your story, roundy? They went this way! Lock down all the exits. Wait. Yeah, smells great. Those cops will be here any minute. What now? No wait, please stop! We're with the Resistance. - Here. - They must have come through here. Go, go, go, go, go! Whoo! Stop enjoying this, stop enjoying this! We've got them. They aren't going anywhere. Move! Get out of the way! Our ship is on the beach straight ahead! We need cover! Too much cover! There it is! - No! - No! Come on! Let the flock go, stick with the perps. Where'd they go? I think we lost them! Now we go down to the beach and circle back around- A cliff! We're trapped. It was worth it, though. To tear up that town... To make 'em hurt. Go. Now it's worth it. There they are. BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing? Oh, do you need a lift? Luke. Leia. I'd rather not do this now. Yeah, me too. Why did you hate your father? Do you have something? A cowl or something you can put on? Why did you hate your father? Give me an honest answer. You had a father who loved you... who gave a damn about you. I didn't hate him. Then why? Why, what? Why what? Say it. Why did you... Why did you kill him? I don't understand. No? Your parents threw you like garbage. - They didn't! - They did. But you can't stop needing them. It is your greatest weakness. You're looking for them everywhere... in Han Solo... now in Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened that night? Yes. No. He sensed my power... as he senses yours. And he feared it. Liar. Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. It's the only way to become what you're meant to be. No! No! Rey? I should have felt trapped or frightened. But no. It didn't go on forever, I knew it was leading somewhere. And that at the end it would show me what I came to see. Rey. Let me see them. My parents... please. I thought I'd find answers here. I was wrong. I've never felt so alone You're not alone. Neither are you. Rey? It isn't too late. Stop! It is true? Did you try to murder him? Leave this island now! Stop. Stop! Did you do it? Did you create Kylo Ren? Tell me the truth. I saw darkness. I'd sensed it building in him. I'd see it at moments during his training. But then I looked inside... and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction, and pain,and death... and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct... I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame... and with consequence. And the last thing I saw... were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him. Ben, no! You failed him by thinking his choice was made It wasn't There is still conflict in him If he turned from the dark side, that could shift the tide. This could be how we win. This is not going to go the way you think. It is. Just now, when we touched hands... I saw his future. As solid as I'm seeing you. If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn. Rey... don't do this. Then he is our last hope. Master Yoda. Young Skywalker. I'm ending all this. The tree, the text, the Jedi. I'm going to burn it down. Skywalker... missed you, have I. So it is time... that the Jedi are to end. Time, it is. For you to look at a pile of old books... The sacred Jedi texts. Oh, read them, have you? - Well, I... - Page turners, they were not. Yes, yes, yes. Wisdom they hail... but that library contains nothing that the girl Rey does... not already possess. Skywalker... Still looking to the horizon. Never here, huh? The need under your nose. I was weak. Unwise. Lost Ben Solo, you did. Lose Rey, we must not. I can't be what she needs me to be. Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength... mastery... But weakness... folly... falure, also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke... we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters. Four parsecs to go, this thing really clicks I hope we are still on time. You can actually do this, right? Yeah, about that... Guys, I can do it. But there exists a previous conversation about price. Once we're done, the Resistance will give you whatever you want. What do you deposit wise? Are you kidding me? Look at us Is that Haysian smelt? It's something. No, we gave you our word. We are going to get paid. It should be enough. Guys, I want to keep helping. But no something, no doing. Okay, listen here... you gotta- Do it. Now I can help. Give it back. What? Give it back! You have no idea what that medallion means to her. What are you...? Why are you ransacking your own ship? It's not your ship. He says I stole it. Yes I got that. We stole it. At least you're stealing from the bad guys... and helping the good. Good guys, bad guys... Made-up words. Let's see who formally owns this gorgeous hunk. This guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh, and the good ones. Finn, let me learn you something big. It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join. That was the last of their support ships. It's just their main cruiser now. And their fuel reserve? Well, according to our calculations... critical. - Is she in there? - Yeah, she forbade you to be on the bridge. - Let's not have a scene. - No, let's. - Holdo? - Captain you're not allowed in here. Fly Boy. Can it, lady. We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship and you've told us nothing! Tell us we that have a plan! That there is hope! When I served under Leia... She would say that hope is like the sun. If you only believe in it when you can see it- You'll never make it through the night. Yes. Are you filling up the transports? You are. All of them? We're abandoning ship? Is that... That's what you got? That's what you brought us to? Coward! Those transports ships are unarmed, unshielded. If we abandon this cruiser, we're done. We don't stand a chance. No, you are not just a coward... You are a traitor. Get this man off my bridge. Finn, Holdo filling the crew to the shuttles. She's going to abandon ship. Where are you? Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet. We're so close. Did you find the master code breaker? We found a code breaker. We can shut the tracker down, just buy us a little more time. All right, hurry. As soon as I launch you jump out of range. Stay there until you get my signal where to rendevous. If you see Finn before I do... tell him... Yeah, perfect. Tell him that. Cloaking our approach. We should be off their scopes. Then we make a slice a slit in their shield. And slip right through them. So a stormtrooper, and a who now are doing what? They are trying to save us. This is our best chance for escape. You have to give Finn and Rose all the time that you can. You have bet the survival of the Resistance... on bad odds and put us all at risk? There's no time now. We have to get clear of the cruiser. - Load the transports. - Right away, Admiral. Yes, I was afraid you'd say that. Vice Admiral Holdo... I am relieving you of your command... for that the survival of this ship, its crew and the Resistance. I hope you understand what you're doing. Yeah. I'm going to the bridge. If they move, stun them. It is at least three cycles. Yes sir. We will work on that. Very good. I will do my best, sir. We are almost there. You don't have to do this. I feel the conflict in you. It's tearing you apart. Ben, when we touched hands... I saw your future. Just the shape of it, but solid and clear. You will not bow before Snoke. You will turn. I'll help you. I saw it. I saw something too Because of what I saw... I know that when it comes, you will be the one to turn. You'll stand with me. Rey. I saw who your parents are. Well done, my good and faithful apprentice. My faith in you, is restored. Young Rey. Welcome. So this is it? The tracker is right behind this door? Haysian smelt. Best conductor. And you're welcome. Good time to figure out how to get back to the fleet. I know where the nearest escape pods are. Of course you do. BB-8, tell me something good. Poe, we're almost there. Have the cruiser prep for lightspeed. Yeah, I'm on it pal. You just hurry. Clear the bridge. Escort the officers down to the hangar. Commander... Captain Dameron, Admiral Holdo was looking for you. Yeah, we spoke. Sir, I am almost afraid to ask. Good instinct, C-3PO. Go with that. Seal that door! We're running out of time. Come on, how's it going? Almost there. 3PO, where do you think you're going? It would be quite against my program... - to be party to a mutiny - Hey! It is not correct protocol. Oh, not with this! Finn? We are ready to make the jump. It's now or never. Now. You, hands up! Watch them. - Drop your weapons, now. - Hands up, rebel scum. Down, I said down! FN-2187. So good to have you back. They didn't make it. Leia. Approach transportation according to your evacuation designation. Clear the transports. Let me push them up, guys. That one's a troublemaker. I like him. Me too. Now, time to board your transport. For the transports to escape... someone needs to stay behind to pilot the cruiser. Too many losses. I can't take anymore. Sure you can. You taught me how. - May the force be- - May the force be- You go on, I've already said it enough. May the force be with you, always. Cloaking device activated, we should drop and go. Let's hope this works. Come closer, child. So much strength. Darkness rises... and light to meet it. I warned my young apprentice... that as he grew stronger... his equal in the light would rise. Skywalker... I assumed... wrongly. Closer, I said. You underestimate Skywalker... and Ben Solo... And me. It will be your downfall. Oh, have you seen something? A weakness in my apprentice. Is that why you came? Young fool. It was I who bridged your minds. I stoked Ren's conflicted soul. I knew he was not strong enough to hide it from you. And you were not wise enough to resist the bait. And now... you will give me Skywalker. Then I will kill you... with the cruelist stroke. No. Yes. Give me... everything. No! No! No. No no no! Poe. What is that? The mineral planet, Crait. An uncharted hideout from the days of the Rebellion. - That's a Rebel base? - Abandoned... but heavily armored... with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies. Scattered in the Outer Rim. Holdo knew the First Order... was tracking our big ship. They're not monitoring small transports. We could slip down to the surface unnoticed... and hide until the First Order passes. It could work. She was more interested in protecting the light than she was... seeming like a hero. God speed Rebels. Well done, Phasma. Your ship and payment, as we agreed. You lying snake-! We got caught, I c-cut a deal. Wait... Cut a deal with what? Sir, we checked on the information from the thief. We ran a de-cloaking scan, and sure enough... 30 Resistance transports have just launched from the cruiser. He told us the truth. Will wonders never cease? No. Our weapons are ready? Ready now, sir. Fire at will. No, no-no you can't-! No! Admiral, we're taking fire! - Do we turn around? - No, you're too far out. Full speed to planet, move... full speed! Well, well... I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise. We will give him and the Jedi Order... the death he desires. After the Rebels are gone, we will go to his planet... and obliterate the entire island. Such spunk. Look here, now. The entire Resistance on those transports. Soon they will all be gone. For you, all is lost. Oh, still that fiery spit of hope. You have the spirit of a true Jedi! And because of that... you must die. My worthy apprentice... son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader. Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve. Where there was weakness, strength. Complete your training... and fulfill your destiny. I know what I have to do. Ben. You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I can not be betrayed... I can not be beaten. I see his mind... I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsabre to strike true. And now... Foolish child. He ignites it... And kill his true enemy! Turn on those thrusters-full speed! Yes sir. You murdering bastard! Oh, t-take it easy, Big F. They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. This is just business. You're wrong. Maybe. Ben! The fleet. Order them to stop firing. There is still time to save the fleet. Ben? It's time to let old things die. Snoke... Skywalker. The Sith... the Jedi, the Rebels... let it all die. Rey. I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy. Don't do this, Ben. Please don't go this way. No, no you're still holding on! Let go! Do you want to know the truth about your parents? Or have you always known? You've just hidden it away. You know the truth. Say it. Say it. They were nobody. They were filthy junk traders... who sold you off for drinking money. They're dead... in a poverished grave in the Jakku desert. You have no place in this story. You come from nothing you're nothing. But not to me. Join me. Please. Sir... the Resistance cruiser's preparing to jump to lightspeed. It's empty. They're just trying to pull our attention away. Pathetic. Keep your fire on the transports. Execution by blaster is too good for them. Let's make this hurt. Finn... On my command. She's running away. No, she isn't. No! Fire on that cruiser! Execute. Finn! There's a shuttle back over there, we've gotta go! Traitor! What? Finn! You were a bug in the system. Let's go, Chrome-dome. Come on! No! Hey. You were always scum. Rebel scum. Hey! Need a lift? What happened? The girl murdered Snoke. What happened? She took Snoke's escape craft. We know where she's going. Get all our forces to that Resistance base. Let's finish this. Finish this? Who do you think you're talking to? You presumed to command my army? Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler! The Supreme Leader is dead. Long live the Supreme Leader. They're coming, shut the door. Incoming! Go, go, move! Get that shield door down! - No, don't shoot it's us! - No, don't, no! Stop your fire! - Don't shoot! - Hold your fire! - Finn? - Finn! Rose! You're not dead! Where is my droid? Buddy! I'm so glad to see you! Wait, what? Wait, slow down. Is this all that's left? All our shields are up, so they can't hit us from orbit. Use whatever power we've got left... to broadcast a distress signal to the Outer Rim. Use my personal code. If there's any allies to the Resistance... it's now or never. Rose, what do you got? Rotted munitions, rusted artillery, and some half gutted skim speeders. Well... Let's just pray that big-ass door holds long enough for us to get help. A battering ram cannon. A what, now? A miniaturized Death Star tech. It will crack that door open like an egg. There has to be a back way out of here, right? BB-8, what do you got? BB-8 analyzed the mine schematics. This is the only way in, or out. Come on. We have allies. People believe in Leia. They'll get our message and they'll come. But we have to buy time. We gotta take out that cannon. Move on, to me! Move, move! Behind! Take your weapons! Come here! Hold your fire! It's salt. Ground forces, incoming. Copy that, on our way. Hey, engage your mono-ski. The green toggle. Alright, listen up. I don't like these rust buckets, and I don't like our odds, but- what the hell? Just keep it tight... and don't get drawn in too close 'till they run that cannon up front. Alright ground forces, lay down some fire! 13 incoming light craft. Should we hold until we clear them? No. The Resistance is in that mine. Push through them. Fighters, break off! Come on! We have to hold them 'till they pull out that cannon! Rose, you've got three right behind you! I can't lose them. Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! I like this! Blow that piece of junk, out of the sky! All fighters! Chewie, pull them out from the battle. Draw them away from the speeders. She drew them off, all of them! Oh, they hate that ship! Chewie! There it is! That is a big gun. Our only shot is right down the throat. The cannon's opening, this is our chance! All firepower on those speeders. Concentrate all fire on the speeders! We're taking heavy losses. They're picking us all off, we're not gonna make it. Alright, I'll make my final approach. Target in sight, guns are hot. No! Pull out! What? The cannon is charged, it's a suicide run! All craft, pull away! - No! I'm almost there! - Retreat, Finn! That's an order. Finn? It's too late! Don't do this! No! I won't let them win! No! Finn, listen to Poe! We have to retreat! It's warming up now. Copy that, we see it. Preparing to fire. Move! Move, go quick! Go! Rose? Rose? Rose? Why would you do that? I was almost there. Why would you stop me? I saved you... silly. That's how we're going to win. Not fighting what we hate... but saving what we love. General Hux. Advance. No quarter... no prisoners. Our distress signal has been received at multiple points... but no response. They've heard us... but no one's coming. We fought until the end. But... the galaxy has lost all it's hope. The spark... is out. Luke. I know what you are going to say. I changed my hair. It's nice that way. Leia... I am sorry. I know. I know you are. I'm just glad you're here... at the end. I came to face him, Leia. And I can't save him. I held out hope for so long, but... I know my son is gone. No one's ever really gone. Master Luke. I want every gun we have to fire on that man. Do it. More! More! That's enough. That's enough! Do you think you got him? Now, if we're ready to get moving... we can finish this. Sir? Bring me down to him. Keep the door covered and don't advance until I say. Supreme Leader... Don't get distracted, our goal... Right away, sir. Med pack! I need a med pack! She's hurt pretty bad. It's Kylo Ren. Luke's facing him alone. We should help him, let's go. No wait. Wait. Did you come back to say you forgive me? To save my soul? No. He's doing this for a reason. He's stalling so we can escape. Escape? It is one man against an army. We have to help him, we have to fight. No, no. We are the spark that will light the fire that will burn the First Order down. Skywalker's doing this so we can survive. There's gotta be a way out of this mine. Hell, how did he get in here? But sir, it is possible that a natural unmapped area exists. But this installation is such a maze of endless tunnels... that the odds of finding an exit are 15,428... Shut up! - To one. - Listen. My audio sensors no longer detect the... Exactly. Where did the crystal critters go? Follow me. What are you looking at me for? Follow him. The beacon's right below us, they have to be somewhere. Keep scanning for life forms. This way. I see them! Chewie, there! No. No, no, no, no, no. No! Lifting rocks. I failed you, Ben. I'm sorry. I'm sure you are! The Resistance is dead. The war is over. And when I kill you... I will have killed the last Jedi. Amazing. Every word of what you just said... was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war... is just beginning. And I will not be THE LAST JEDI I'll destroy her... and you... and all of it. No. Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you. Just like your father. No. See you around, kid. No! He's a very good friend. Chewie! Looks good. It was crazy, man. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Poe. Rey. I know. I have a contact in the Outer Rim. It is very possible. Luke is gone. I felt it. But it wasn't sadness nor pain. It was... peace and purpose. I felt it too. How do we build a Rebellion from this? We have everything we need. Luke Skywalker. Jedi Master\n                    "}, "Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back": {"transcript": "\n\n                        Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Steady. Steady, girl. What's the matter? You smell something? Chewie. Chewie? All right. Don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo. No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. - You'll know if anything comes around. - Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity, it's gonna be difficult to spot approaching ships. General, I gotta leave. I can't stay any more. - I'm sorry to hear that. - There's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a dead man. A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General. Well, Your Highness, guess this is it. That's right. Don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han. - Yes, Your Highnessness. - I thought you had decided to stay. The bounty hunter we ran into in Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you. - We need? - Yes. - What about you need? - I need? I don't know what you're talking about. - You probably don't. - What precisely am I supposed to know? Come on. You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader. No. That's not it. Come on. - Come on. - You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I'd leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? - I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. - I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss! Don't blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. It's supposed to be freezing. How we're going to dry her clothes I really don't know. Oh, switch off! Why did you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here. - Excuse me. - Put them back together right now. - Might I have a word? - What do you want? Princess Leia's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her. Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back. - She doesn't know where he is. - I don't know where he is. - Nobody knows where he is. - What do you mean, nobody knows? Deck Officer. - Deck Officer. - Excuse me, sir. Might I-- Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? - It's getting dark out there. - Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I enquire what's going on? - Why not? - Impossible man. Come along, R2. Let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger. Commander Skywalker hasn't come in the south entrance. - Maybe he forgot to check in. - Not likely. Are the speeders ready? Not yet. We're having trouble adapting them to the cold. -We'll have to go out on tauntauns. -The temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right, and my friend's out in it. Your tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell. You must come along now, R2. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say things like that. Of course we'll see Master Luke again. And he'll be quite all right. You'll see. Stupid little short circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no-- Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals ... although he admits that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. - Close the doors. - Yes, sir. R2 says the chances of survival are 725-to-1. Actually, R2 has been known to make mistakes ... from time to time. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know, for a human being. Luke. Luke. Ben? You will go to the Dagobah system. Dagobah system? There you will learn from Yoda ... the Jedi master who instructed me. Don't do this, Luke. Give me a sign here. - Not much time. - Ben. Hang on, kid. Dagobah system. Dagobah. This may smell bad, kid ... Yoda. but it'll keep you warm till I get the shelter up. Ben. Dagobah. I thought they smelled bad ... on the outside. Echo Base, I've got something. Not much, but it could be a life form. Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two. This is Rogue Two. Captain Solo, do you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two. Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo Base, this is Rogue Two. I've found them. Repeat. I've found them. Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again. Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again. - Thanks, 3PO. - R2 expresses his relief also. How ya feelin', kid? You don't look so bad to me. You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark. - Thanks to you. - That's two you owe me, junior. Well, Your Worship ... looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave ... until we've activated the energy field. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight. I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain. Laugh it up, fuzzball ... but you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My -- Why, you stuck-up, half-witted ... scruffy-looking nerf herder! Who's scruffy-lookin'? I must have hit close to the mark to get her riled up like that, huh, kid? I guess you don't know everything about women yet. Headquarters personnel, report to command centre. Headquarters personnel, report to command centre. Take it easy. Excuse us, please. Princess, we have a visitor. We picked up something outside Zone 1 2 moving east. - It's metal. - It couldn't be one of those creatures. - Could be one of our speeders. - No. Wait. There's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an imperial code. It isn't friendly. Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rogues 1 0 and 1 1 to Station 38. - I'm afraid there's not much left. - What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. - Must have had a self-destruct. - An imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation. - Admiral. - Yes, Captain? I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment ... from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. - I want proof, not leads. - The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed up every lead -- But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of humans forms. - You found something? - Yes, my lord. That's it. The rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. - It could be smugglers -- - That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare your men. Admiral. Groups Seven and 1 0 will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded ... evacuation control will give clearance for launch. Right, sir. All right. That's it. Try it. Turn it off! Turn it off! Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-4 7 s. Forget the heavy equipment. There's time to get small modules on the transports. - Take care, sir. - Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Okay, okay. Hi, kid. There's gotta be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Be careful. You too. General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers ... coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four. Reroute all power to the energy shield. We gotta hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault. -What is it, General? -The fleet has moved out of light speed. ComScan has detected an energy field ... protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser. He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord. Lord Vader. The fleet has moved out of light speed, and we're preparing to -- You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. - Captain Piett. - Yes, my lord? Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field ... and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off the system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader. All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time ... so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Stardestroyer? The ion cannon will fire several shots ... to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield ... proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Good luck. Everybody to your stations. Let's go. Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open shield. Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control. Fire. The first transport is away. The first transport is away. Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dak. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station 3-T8. We've spotted imperial walkers. Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo Station 57, we're on our way. All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dak. Attack pattern Delta. Go now. I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armour's too strong for blasters. Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance. Stand by, Dak. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. Just hang on. Hang on, Dak. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dak? Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generators. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rogue Three. Copy, Rogue Leader. Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. Coming around, Rogue Leader. Steady, Rogue Two. Activate harpoon. Good shot,Janson. One more pass. Cable out. Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! - That got him! - I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. - Launch patrol. - Evacuate remaining ground staff. This one goes there, that one goes there. Right? R2, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. - Rogue Two, are you all right? - Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader. Set harpoon. I'll cover for you. - Coming around. - Watch that crossfire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. This is it! Hobbie! I've been hit! - You all right? - Why are you still here? - Heard the command centre had been hit. - You've got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm gonna get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in Sector 1 2 to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Imperial troops have entered -- Come on. That's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports. Wait for me. Begin retreat! Fall back! - Distance to power generators? - 17.28. Target. Maximum firepower. Transport, this is Solo. Take off. I can't get to you. I'll get her out on the Falcon. Come on. Where are you going? Come back! Wait! Wait for me! Stop! - How typical. - Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod! You're gonna be a permanent resident. Wait! Wait! - How's this? - Would it help if I got out and pushed? - Captain Solo. Captain Solo. - It might. Sir, might I suggest that you -- It can wait. This bucket of bolts will never get past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her. Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you'll be wrong. I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it! R2. Get her ready for take-off. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, R2. We're going. We're going. There's nothing wrong, R2. I'm just setting a new course. We're not gonna regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, R2. That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while. - I saw 'em! I saw 'em! - Saw what? Stardestroyers, two of'em coming right at us. - Sir, might I suggest -- - Shut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield. Great. Well, we can still outmanoeuvre them. Take evasive action! - Prepare to jump to light speed. - But, sir! They're getting closer. Oh, yeah? Watch this. Watch what? - I think we're in trouble. - If I may say so ... I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. - It's impossible to go to light speed. - We're in trouble. Horizontal boosters! Alluvial dampers. That's not it. Bring me the hydrospanner. I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one. Chewie! That wasn't a laser blast. Something hit us. Han, get up here. Come on, Chewie! Asteroids. - Chewie, set 271 . - What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field ... - is approximately 3,720-to-1 . - Never tell me the odds. You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. This could be it. I take it back. We're gonna get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. - Ain't gonna argue with that. - Pulverized? I'm going closer to one of the big ones. - Closer? - Closer? This is suicide! There's nowhere to go. There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah. Me too. Yep, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not gonna change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life form readings though. There's something alive down there. Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know! I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing. Just hang on. I'm gonna start the landing cycle. No, R2, you stay put. I'll have a look around. R2? Where are you? R2! You be more careful. R2, that way. R2! Oh, no. Are you all right? Come on. You were lucky to get out of there. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea ... I'm beginning to agree with ya. R2, what are we doing here? It's like ... something out of a dream or -- I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy. Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord ... but it has entered an asteroid field, and we cannot risk -- Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. - I want that ship, not excuses. - Yes, lord. I'm gonna shut down everything but the emergency power systems. Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does that include shutting me down too? No. I need you to talk to the Falcon ... find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Sometimes I just don't understand human behaviour. After all, I'm only trying to do my job. Let go. - Let go, please. - Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. I haven't got time for anything else. Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda ... if he even exists. It's really a strange place to find a Jedi master. This place gives me the creeps. Still ... there's something familiar about this place. I don't know. - I feel like -- - Feel like what? Like we're being watched. Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? - I'm looking for someone. - Looking? Found someone you have, I would say. Right. Help you I can. Yes. I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Great warrior. Wars not make one great. Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle. If we could get our ship out, we would. But we can't. Aw, cannot get your ship out. Get out of there. Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. You're making a mess. Hey, give me that. Mine, or I will help you not. I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mud-hole. Mud-hole? Slimy? My home this is. R2, let him have it. - Mine! Mine! Mine! - R2. Will you move along, little fella? We got a lot of work to do. Stay and help you I will. Find your friend. I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi master. Jedi master. Yoda. - You seek Yoda. - You know him? Take you to him I will. Yes, yes, but now we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. R2 ... stay and watch after the camp. Where is R2 when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate ... but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe it says the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here. And, Chewie ... I think we better replace the negative power coupling. Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. - You make it so difficult sometimes. - I do. I really do. You could be a little nicer though. Admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally, maybe ... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. - Stop that. - Stop what? Stop that. My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty too. What are you afraid of? - Afraid? - You're trembling. I'm not trembling. You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. - I'm a nice man. - No, you're not. Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - You're perfectly welcome, sir. That, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. - Lord Vader. - Yes, Admiral. What is it? The emperor commands you to make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field ... so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord. What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy -- the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy ... is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker. How is that possible? Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned ... he would become a powerful ally. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, master. I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience. For the Jedi, it is time to eat as well. Eat. Eat. Hot. Good food. Good. How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Root leaf. I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess. Father. Powerful Jedi was he. - Powerful Jedi. - Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time! I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Much anger in him ... like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? No. - He is not ready. - Yoda. I am ready. I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm -- Ready, are you? What know you ready? For 800 years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment ... the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away ... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was ... what he was doing. Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless. So was I, if you remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. - Will he finish what he begins? - I won't fail you. I'm not afraid. You will be. You will be. - Sir, if I may venture an opinion -- - I'm not interested in your opinion. There's something out there. - Where? - Outside in the cave. There it is. Listen! - I'm going out there. - Are you crazy? I just got this bucket together. I won't let it get torn apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay behind and guard the ship. Oh, no. This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! It's all right. It's all right. Yeah, that's what I thought -- mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship and make sure there are no more attached ... chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Go away! Go away, beastly thing! Shoo! Wait a minute. - Chewie, let's get out of here! - The Empire is still out there! No time to discuss this in committee! I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field. Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off. - Look! - I see it. - We're doomed! - The cave is collapsing. - This is no cave. - What? Yes, run. Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression -- The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path ... forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. - Is the dark side stronger? - No, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. How am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know ... when you are calm, at peace ... passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defence ... never for attack. - But tell me why I can't -- - No. There is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. There's something not right here. I feel cold. - Death. - That place ... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. Your weapons ... you will not need them. Bounty hunters. We don't need their scum. - Yes, sir. - Those rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. There will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary ... but I want them alive. No disintegrations. - As you wish. - Lord Vader. My lord, we have them. Thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light speed? One, two ... three! It's not fair. Transfer circuits aren't working. It's not my fault. - No light speed? - It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. Turn her around! I'm gonna put all power in the front shield. - You're gonna attack? - The odds of surviving ... a direct assault on an imperial Star Destroyer-- Shut up! They're moving to attack position. Shields up. Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. - There's no trace of them. - Captain, Lord Vader demands an update. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them and apologize to Lord Vader. - Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. - Yes, Captain Needa. Use the Force. Yes. Now, the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No. No different. Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. - All right. I'll give it a try. - Try not. Do ... or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? And well you should not ... for my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it ... makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us ... and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you, me ... the tree, the rock -- everywhere. Yes ... even between the land and the ship. You want the impossible. I don't believe it. That is why you fail. Apology accepted, Captain Needa. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light speed ... it'll be on the other side of the galaxy now. Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory. - Yes, my lord. We'll find them. - Don't fail me again ... Admiral. Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet. Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet's beginning to break up. Go stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how that's going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough -- - Thank you. - What did you have in mind next? If they follow standard imperial procedure ... they'll dump their garbage before they go to light speed. - Then we just float away. - With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we gotta find a safe port somewhere around here. Any ideas? - Where are we? - The Anoat system. The Anoat system. There's not much there. Oh, wait. This is interesting. - Lando. - Lando system? Lando's not a system. He's a man. Lando Calrissian. Card player, gambler. - A scoundrel. You'd like him. - Thanks. Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. - A mining colony? - Yeah, a tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. - Can you trust him? - No. But he's got no love for the Empire. I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach. You do have your moments. Not many of them, but you do have them. Concentrate. Feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm. Yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future. The past. Old friends long gone. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw a city in the clouds. Friends you have there. - They were in pain. - It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've gotta go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could ... but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered. No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Wait a minute! Let me explain! You will not deviate from your present course. - Rather touchy, aren't they? - I thought you knew this person. That was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform 327. Thank you. Nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried? No one to meet us. I don't like this. - What would you like? - They did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open. Hey. Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler. You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doin', you old pirate? So good to see you! - I never thought I'd see you again. - Well, he seems very friendly. Yes. Very friendly. What are you doing here? Repairs. I thought you could help me out. - What have you done to my ship? - Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. How you doin', Chewbacca? Still hanging around with this loser? Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. - And who might you be? - Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right. You old smoothie. Hello, sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your -- Well, really! - What's wrong with the Falcon? - Hyperdrive. - I'll get my people to work on her. - Good. That ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Still paying off for you? Not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labour difficulties. - What's so funny? - You. Listen to you. You sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? Seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful. Nice to see a familiar face. How rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if -- Hello? How interesting. - Who are you? - Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. Please don't get up. Luke, you must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. I've gotta help them. You must not go. - But Han and Leia will die if I don't. - You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them. I feel the Force. But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you ... when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave. But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the emperor wants. That is why your friends are made to suffer. That's why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi knight, with the Force as his ally ... will conquer Vader and his emperor. If you end your training now ... if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil. Patience. - And sacrifice Han and Leia? - If you honour what they fight for ... yes. If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. R2, fire up the converters. Don't give in to hate. That leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now ... matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No, there is another. The ship's almost finished. Two or three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him either, but he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. Then you're as good as gone, aren't you? What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? What a mess. Chewie, you think you can repair him? - Lando's got people that can fix him. - No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Would you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with your droid? No. No problem. Why? You see, since we're a small operation ... we don't fall into the jurisdiction of the Empire. - So you're part of the Mining Guild? - No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed. Which is advantageous for everybody ... since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's gonna find out, shut you down? It's been a danger that looms like a shadow over everything we've built. But things have developed that'll ensure security. I've just made a deal that'll keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honoured if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. No, 3PO's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. No, please don't get up. Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot! Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt ... after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That wasn't part of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly? No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal is getting worse all the time. Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Something's not right because now I can't see. That's much better. Wait. Wait. Oh, my! What have you done? I'm backwards! You flea-bitten furball! Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough -- I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. - Get out of here, Lando. - Shut up and listen. Vader's agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. They'll have to stay here, but they'll be safe. -And Han? -Vader's given him to the bounty hunter. - Vader wants us all dead. - He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker. - Lord Vader set a trap for him. - And we're the bait. - He's on his way. - Perfect. You fixed us all real good, didn't you? My friend. Stop! I've done all I can. Sorry I couldn't do better, but I got my own problems. Yeah. You're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people. This facility is crude ... but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker ... for his journey to the emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching, X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. It might kill him. I do not want the emperor's prize damaged. We will test it on Captain Solo. If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility for me ... so don't do anything foolish. What's going on, buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in. Chewbacca, stop! No, Chewie, stop! You're going to get us all killed! Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die. Hey! Hey! Listen to me. Chewie, this won't help me. Hey, save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess. You have to take care of her. Do you hear me? - I love you. - I know. What's going on? Turn round. I can't see. They've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected ... if he survived the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours, bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way in here. Calrissian ... take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further. Luke, don't! It's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet. Well done. Hold them in the security tower. And keep it quiet. Move. - What do you think you're doing? - We're getting out of here. I knew all along. It had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han -- - I had no choice. - What are you doing? Trust him! We understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help. We don't need any of your help. What? - It sounds like Han. - There's still a chance to save Han ... at the east ... platform. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee. Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. R2, where have you been? Wait. Turn around, you woolly -- Hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter. Well, at least you're still in one piece. Look what's happened to me. Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you! You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. All too easy. Perhaps you're not as strong as the emperor thought. Impressive. Most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear. Now, release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me. The security code has been changed. R2, you can tell the computer to override the security systems. R2, hurry. Attention. This is Lando Calrissian. Attention. The Empire has taken control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more imperial troops arrive. This way. Well, don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump! I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! That hurts! Bend down, you thoughtless -- Ow! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course I've looked better. You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me ... and I will complete your training. With our combined strength ... we can end this destructive conflict ... and bring order to the galaxy. I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough. He told me you killed him. I am your father. That's not true. That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. You can destroy the emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me ... and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It is the only way. Ben. Ben, please. Hear me. - We've got to go back. - What? - I know where Luke is. - What about those fighters? Chewie, just do it. All right, all right! Alert my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. We'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. - Lando? - Okay, let's go. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back. Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them! It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? - Yes, my lord. - Good. Prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun. - Yes, my lord. Lieutenant. - Yes, sir. Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? R2-D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing. Father. Son, come with me. Ben. Why didn't you tell me? It's Vader. Luke, it is your destiny. Why didn't you tell me? Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. R2, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet. You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces and you're having delusions of grandeur! You did it! - Luke, we're ready for take-off. - Good luck, Lando. When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. bidx/sub to srt conversion by Xpuntar/b Utility used: SubRip 1.50b4\n                    "}, "Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith": {"transcript": "\n\n                        Lock on to him, R2. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead- Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead- the one crawling with vulture droids. I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy. - Oddball, do you copy? - Copy, Red Leader. Mark my position. Form your squad up behind me. We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position. This is where the fun begins. Let them pass between us. They're all over me. - Get them off my- - I'm gonna go help them out. No. They are doing theirjob so we can do ours. Missiles. Pull up. - They overshot us. - They're coming around. All right, R4. No, no. Nothing too fancy. Surge all power units, R2. Stand by reverse thrusters. We got 'em, R2. Flying is for droids. - I'm hit. Anakin? - I see them. Buzz droids. R4, be careful. You have a- Oh, dear. They're shutting down all the controls. Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them. The mission. Get to the command ship. Get the chancellor. I'm running out of tricks here. In the name of- - Hold your fre! You're not helping. - I agree. Bad idea. I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me. Anakin! - Move to the right. - Hold on. You'll get us both killed. Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do. I'm not leaving without you, Master. Get him, R2. Watch out. R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye. - Yeah, you got him! - Great, R2. The general's command ship is dead ahead. Have you noticed the shields are still up? Sorry, Master. I have a bad feeling about this. There they are. Get them. R2, locate the chancellor. The chancellor's signal is coming from right there- the observation platform at the top of that spire. I sense Count Dooku. - I sense a trap. - Next move? Spring the trap. R2, go back. I need you to stay with the ship. Here. Take this and wait for orders. What's the situation, Captain? Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay. We're tracking them. Just as Count Dooku predicted. Destroyers. Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em. - Roger. - Roger, roger. Those are Jedi fghters all right. - Did you press the stop button? - No. Did you? There's more than one way out of here. We don't want to get out. We want to get moving. R2, activate elevator 31174. - Come in, R2. - What that? R2, do you copy? R2, activate the elevator number 31174. Get back to work. That nothin'. Activate the elevator 31174. R2- Always on the move. R2, switch on the comlink. R2, can you hear me? R2? R2! R2! Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up. Hands up, Jedi. R2, do you copy? R2, do you hear me? R2, we need to be going up, not down. Hey, you! That's better. You stupid little astro droid. Oh, it's you. My eyes! My eyes! - What was that all about? - R2 has been- - No loose wire jokes. - Did I say anything? - He's trying. - I didn't say anything. - Chancellor. - Are you all right? Count Dooku. - This time we will do it together. - I was about to say that. Get help. You're no match for him. He's a Sith lord. Chancellor Palpatine, Sith lords are our speciality. Your swords, please. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor. You won't get away this time, Dooku. I've been looking forward to this. My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count. Good. Twice the pride, double the fall. Get- I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate. You have anger. But you don't use them. Good, Anakin. Good. Kill him. Kill him now. I shouldn't. Do it. You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive. Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. I shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way. It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the frst time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People? Now we must leave before more security droids arrive. Anakin, there's no time. We must get off this ship before it's too late. - He seems to be all right. - Leave him, or we'll never make it. His fate will be the same as ours. Prepare for attack! All batteries, fre! Fire! Elevator's not working. R2, activate elevator 3224. - Reverse stabilizers. - Reversing stabilizers. Magnetize! Magnetize! Fire the emergency booster engines. We're levelling out, sir. Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here. - Did I miss something? - Hold on. - What is that? - Oops. R2. R2, shut down the elevator. Too late. Jump! Let's see if we can fnd something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. R2, get down here. R2, do you copy? General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328. Activate ray shields. Ray shields. Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this. Apparently not. - I say patience. - Patience? Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments... and then he'll release the ray shields. See? No problem. Don't move. Do you have a plan B? Ah, yes. The negotiator. General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you. Excuse me. - That wasn't much of a rescue. - You're welcome. And- Anakin Skywalker. I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little... older. General Grievous. You're shorter than I expected. Jedi scum. We have a job to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him. Your lightsabres will make a fne addition to my collection. Not this time. And this time, you won't escape. R2. Crush them! Make them suffer! Come. Now! Stay at your stations! Get him! Get him! Run! Don't bother with them. - Keep the ship in orbit. - Yes, sir. You lose, General Kenobi. Get out of here! Run! Time to abandon ship. All the escape pods have been launched. Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this? - You mean, can I land what's left of it? - Well? Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in. Open all hatches. Extend all flaps and drag fns. We lost something. Not to worry. We are still flying half a ship. Now we're really picking up speed. Eight plus 60. - We're in the atmosphere. - Grab that. Keep us level. Steady. Easy, R2. Fire ships on the left and the right. - We'll take you in. - Copy that. - Landing strip, straight ahead. - We're coming in too hot. Another happy landing. Coming, Master? No. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy. Hold on. This whole operation was your idea. Let us not forget, Anakin, that you rescued me from the buzz droids. And you killed Count Dooku, and you rescued the chancellor... carrying me unconscious on your back. All because of your training. Anakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero... and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians. All right. But you owe me one, and not for saving your skin for the 10th time. Ninth time. That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefng. Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right? Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again. General Grievous will run and hide, as he always does. He's a coward. But with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the droid army. And I assure you... the senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive. Then the Jedi Council will make fnding Grievous our highest priority. - Watch it. - Excuse me. - Come along, R2. - The Republic cannot praise you enough. Thank you, Senator Organa. It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. Now there I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself. But the fghting will continue until General Grievous is spare parts. I will do everything I can in the senate. - Excuse me. - Certainly. I've missed you, Padm. There were whispers that you'd been killed. I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been, if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges. - Wait. Not here. - Yes, here. I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married. Anakin, don't say things like that. Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on? Something wonderful has happened. Ani, I'm pregnant. That's wonderful. What are we gonna do? We're not gonna worry about anything right now. All right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life. Yes, Lord Sidious? General Grievous... I suggest you move the separatist leaders to Mustafar. It will be done, my lord. The end of the war is near, General. But the loss of Count Dooku- His death was a necessary loss. Soon I will have a new apprentice- one far younger and more powerful. Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We can go to the lake country where no one will know... where we can be safe. I can go early and fx up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot. Right by the gardens. You are so... beautiful. It's only because I'm so in love. No, it's because I'm so in love with you. So love has blinded you? That's not exactly what I meant. But it's probably true. Anakin, help me! What's bothering you? Nothing. I remember when I gave this to you. How long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other? - It was a dream. - Bad? Like the ones I used to have about my mother, just before she died. And? And it was about you. Tell me. It was only a dream. You die in childbirth. And the baby? I don't know. - It was only a dream. - I won't let this one become real. This baby will change our lives. I doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate. If the council discovers you're the father, you'll be expelled- I know. I know. Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us? We don't need his help. Our baby is a blessing. Premonitions? Premonitions. These visions you have- They're of pain, suffering. Death. Yourself you speak of, or someone you know? Someone. Close to you? Yes. Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side. I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda. Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is. What must I do, Master Yoda? Train yourself to let go... of everything you fear to lose. You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges. I'm sorry. I was held up. - I have no excuse. - In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity. What's wrong, then? The senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today. That can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It'll make it easier for us to end this war. Be careful of your friend Palpatine. Be careful of what? - He has requested your presence. - What for? He would not say. He didn't inform the council? That's unusual, isn't it? All of this is unusual. And it's making me feel uneasy. I hope you trust me, Anakin. Of course. I need your help, son. What do you mean? I'm depending on you. For what? I don't understand. To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic. I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council. Me? A master? I'm overwhelmed, sir. But the council elects its own members. They'll never accept this. I think they will. They need you. More than you know. Allow this appointment lightly the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine. I understand. You are on this council... but we do not grant you the rank of master. What? How can you do this? This is outrageous. It's unfair. How can you be on the council and not be a master? Take a seat, young Skywalker. Forgive me, Master. We have surveyed all systems in the Republic... but have found no sign of General Grievous. Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is. The outlying systems you must sweep. We do not have many ships to spare. What about the droid attack on the Wookiees? It is critical we send an attack group there immediately. He's right. It's a system we cannot afford to lose. Go I will. Good relations with the Wookiees I have. It's settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all. What kind of nonsense is this? Put me on the council and not make me a master? It's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting. Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honour. To be on the council at your age- it's never happened before. The fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor. The council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs. I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council. But it's what you wanted. Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. That has nothing to do with this. The only reason the council has approved your appointment... is because the chancellor trusts you. And? Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't want to put you in this situation. What situation? The council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to. They want me to spy on the chancellor? - But that's treason. - We are at war, Anakin. Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session? This assignment is not to be on record. The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here. That is why you must help us. Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader... who has managed to stay in offce long after his term has expired. The senate demanded that he stay longer. Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place. You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me? The council is asking you. Anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm. It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him. With all due respect, Master, is he not the chosen one? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force? So the prophecy says. A prophecy that misread could have been. He will not let me down. He never has. I hope right you are. Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order. I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic. Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? What do you mean? What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists... and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fghting to destroy? I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a separatist. This war represents a failure to listen. Now you're closer to the chancellor than anyone. Please, ask him to stop the fghting and let diplomacy resume. Don't ask me to do that. Make a motion in the senate, where that kind of a request belongs. - What is it? - Nothing. Don't do this. Don't shut me out. Let me help you. Hold me. Like you did by the lake on Naboo. So long ago, when there was nothing but our love. No politics, no plotting, no war. - You wanted to see me, Chancellor. - Yes, Anakin. Come closer. I have good news. Our clone intelligence units... have discovered the location of General Grievous. He's hiding in the Utapau system. At last. We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council... if it didn't select you for this assignment. You're the best choice, by far. Sit down. Leave us. You know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. I'm not sure I understand. You must sense what I have come to suspect. The Jedi Council want control of the Republic. They're planning to betray me. - I don't think that- - Anakin. Search your feelings. You know, don't you? I know they don't trust you. Or the senate. Or the Republic. Or democracy, for that matter. I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken. Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? They asked you to spy on me, didn't they? I don't know what to say. Remember back to your early teachings. All who gain power are afraid to lose it. - Even the Jedi. - The Jedi use their power for good. Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way... including their quest for greater power. The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards- only about themselves. And the Jedi don't? The Jedi are selfless. They only care about others. Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith... Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith... so powerful and so wise... he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians... to create... life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side... he could even keep the ones he cared about... from dying. He could actually... save people from death? The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities... some consider to be unnatural. What happened to him? He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was... Iosing his power. Which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic. He could save others from death... but not himself. Is it possible to learn this power? Not from a Jedi. All Red units, over here! Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau? A partial message was intercepted... in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of Utapau. Act on this we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed. The chancellor has requested... that I lead the campaign. The council will make up its own mind who is to go... not the chancellor. A master is needed, with more experience. I concur. Master Kenobi should go. I agree. Aye. Aye. Very well. Council adjourned. The droids have started up their main power generators. - Then now the time is, Commander. - Yes, sir. Charge! Head for cover! - You're gonna need me on this one. - I agree. However, it may turn out Just to be a wild bantha chase. Master. I've disappointed you. I haven't been very appreciative of your training. I've been arrogant, and I apologize. I've just been so frustrated with the council. You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be. But be patient, Anakin. It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master. Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you. Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you. Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here. On the far side. I'll keep them distracted until you get there. - Just don't take too long. - Come on. When have I ever let you down? Very well. The burden is on me not to destroy all the droids until you arrive. Save your energy. I can't. Don't give up, Padm. Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he? He came by this morning. What did he want? He's worried about you. He says you've been under a lot of stress. I feel lost. Lost? What do you mean? Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me. They trust you with their lives. Something's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't. You expect too much of yourself. - I found a way to save you. - Save me? From my nightmares. Is that what's bothering you? I won't lose you, Padm. I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani. - I promise you. - No, I promise you. Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary? Unfortunately, the war. There's no war here- unless you brought it with you. With your kind permission, I should like some fuel... and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous. He is here. We are being held hostage. - They are watching us. - I understand. Tenth level, thousands of battle droids. Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time. Take the fghter back to the ship. Tell Cody I've made contact. - Is he bringing additional warriors? - He didn't say. It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outer rim. It is a volcanic planet. - You will be safe there. - Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General. Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe. Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip. Your ship is waiting. Hello there. General Kenobi. You are a bold one. Kill him. Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself. Your move. You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku. Attack, Kenobi. Army or not... you must realize you are doomed. I don't think so. Cover that corner. Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous... and we have begun our attack. Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions. Yes, Master. I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor. If he does not give up his emergency powers... after the destruction of Grievous... then he should be removed from office. The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate... in order to secure a peaceful transition. To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Great care we must take. Chancellor. We've just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous. We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge. I should be there with him. It's upsetting to me to see that the council... doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi master? I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that... I'm being excluded from the council. I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me. They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force. How do you know the ways of the Force? My mentor taught me everything about the Force. Even the nature of the dark side. You know the dark side? If one is to understand the great mystery... one must study all its aspects... not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader... you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force... and you will be able to save your wife... from certain death. What did you say? Use my knowledge. I beg you. You're the Sith lord. I know what's been troubling you. Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council. Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life... greater than that of an ordinary Jedi. A life of signifcance... of conscience. - Are you going to kill me? - I would certainly like to. I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus... makes you stronger. I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council. Of course. You should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? I will quickly discover the truth of all this. You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. Power to save Padm. So uncivilized. Master Windu, I must talk to you. Skywalker, we just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We're on our way to make sure... the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate. He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord. A Sith lord? Yes. The one we've been looking for. - How do you know this? - He knows the ways of the Force. He's been trained to use the dark side. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive. Master, the chancellor is very powerful. You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him. For you own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgement. - I must go, Master. - No. If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust. But for now, remain here. Wait in the council chambers until we return. Yes, Master. You do know, don't you... if theJedi destroy me... any chance of saving her will be lost. Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say you're here sooner than expected. In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic... you're under arrest, Chancellor. Are you threatening me, Master Jedi? The senate will decide your fate. - I am the senate. - Not yet. It's treason then. You are under arrest, my lord. Anakin, I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over. The oppression of the Sith will never return. You have lost. You will die! He's a traitor! He is the traitor! I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. Don't listen to him, Anakin! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold it any longer. I can't. I'm weak. I'm too weak. Help me. Help me! I can't hold on any longer. I am going to end this once and for all. You can't. He must stand trial. He has control of the senate and the courts. He's too dangerous to be left alive. I'm too weak. - Don't kill me. Please. - It's not the Jedi way. He must live. - Please don't. - I need him. Please don't! Power! Unlimited power! What have I done? You're fulflling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force. I will do whatever you ask. Good. Just help me save Padm's life. I can't live without her. To cheat death is a power only one has achieved... but if we work together... I know we can discover the secret. I pledge myself... to your teachings. Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth you shall be known as... Darth... Vader. Thank you, my master. Rise. Because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice... I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here... they will kill us, along with all the senators. I agree. The council's next move will be against the senate. Every single Jedi... including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi... is now an enemy of the Republic. I understand, Master. We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless. If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First I want you to go to the Jedi temple. We will catch them off-balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side... to save Padm. What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy? Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the temple... go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray... and the other separatist leaders. Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy! And... we shall have... peace. Sergeant, over here! Hurry! All of them! All Red units, let's move it! Come on. Let's go! Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels. Very good, sir. By the way, I think you'll be needing this. Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win. Yes, sir. Commander Cody... the time has come. Execute order 66. Yes, my lord. Blast him! Come on! Execute order 66. It will be done, my lord. It will be done, my lord. Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do? The chancellor's offce indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple. Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right. - What's going on here? - There's been a rebellion, sir. Don't worry. The situation is under control. I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave. And so it is. Get him! Don't worry about him. Let him go. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east. Yes, sir. Goodbye, Tarfful. Goodbye, Chewbacca. Miss you I will. Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a few Jedi... before they walk into this catastrophe. Did you fnd Kenobi? Sir, no one could have survived that fall. Start loading your men on the ships. Move it. Emergency code 913. I have no contact on any frequency. Master Kenobi. - Repeat. - Master Kenobi. Senator Organa. My clone troops turned on me. I need help. We havejust rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates. Hush! Not so loud. Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple. - You could see the smoke from here. - I'm fne. I came to see if you and the baby are safe. What's happening? The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic. I can't believe that. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself. What are you gonna do? I will not betray the Republic. My loyalties lie with the chancellor... and with the senate and with you. - What about Obi-Wan? - I don't know. Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor. Anakin, I'm afraid. Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The chancellor has given me a very important mission. The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return. Things will be different. I promise. Please, wait for me. Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2. Take care, my little friend. Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do? No, thank you, 3PO. I feel so helpless. How many other Jedi have managed to survive? Heard from no one have we. I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda. Have we had any contact from the temple? Received a coded retreat message we have. It requests all Jedi to return to the temple. - It says the war is over. - Then we must go back. If there are any stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed. Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you? Yes, Master. There is too much at stake. I agree. And a little more knowledge might light our way. The plan has gone as you had promised, my lord. You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives... he will take care of you. We're receiving a message from the chancellor's offce, sir. - Send it through. - Yes, sir. Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor requests your presence... at a special session of Congress. - I will be there. - He'll be expecting you. - Could be a trap. - I don't think so. The chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems... without keeping the senate intact. If a special session of Congress there is... easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be. R2, stay with the ship. Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you. And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. What's happened? The chancellor's been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate. The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. Not even the younglings survived. Killed not by clones this Padawan. By a lightsabre he was. Who? Who could have done this? The attempt on my life... has left me scarred and deformed. But I assure you. My resolve has never been stronger! Stop! In order to ensure the security and continuing stability... the Republic will be reorganized... into the frst Galactic Empire! For a safe and secure society. So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause. The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want- I have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away. For the clones... to discover the recalibration a long time it will take. Wait. Master. There is something I must know. If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you fnd. I must know the truth, Master. It can't be. It can't be. You have done well, my new apprentice. Now, Lord Vader... go and bring peace to the Empire. I can't watch any more. Destroy the Sith we must. Send me to kill the emperor. I will not kill Anakin. To fght this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not. He is like my brother. I cannot do it. Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is. Consumed by Darth Vader. I do not know where the emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look. Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and fnd him you will. When was the last time you saw him? - Yesterday. - And do you know where he is now? Padm, I need your help. - He is in grave danger. - From the Sith? From himself. Anakin has turned to the dark side. You're wrong. How could you even say that? I have seen a security hologram... of him... killing younglings. Not Anakin. He couldn't. He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice. I don't believe you. I can't. I must fnd him. You're going to kill him, aren't you? He has become a very great threat. I can't. Anakin is the father, isn't he? I'm so sorry. - Milady, let me come with you. - There's no danger. The fghting's over. And this is personal. As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree. I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, 3PO will look after me. Oh, dear. Do you know? I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business. The separatists have been taken care of, my master. It is fnished then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. All droid units must shut down immediately. Very good, my lord. I saw your ship. - What are you doing out here? - I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things. What things? He said you've turned to the dark side. That you... killed younglings. Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me. He cares about us. Us? He knows. He wants to help you. Anakin, all I want is your love. Love won't save you, Padm. - Only my new powers can do that. - At what cost? You're a good person. Don't do this. I won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of. And I'm doing it for you. To protect you. Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can. Don't you see? We don't have to run away any more. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the chancellor. I can overthrow him. And together, you and I can rule the galaxy... make things the way we want them to be. I don't believe what I'm hearing. Obi-Wan was right. You've changed. I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me. I don't know you any more. You're breaking my heart. You're going down a path I can't follow. Because of Obi-Wan? Because of what you've done. What you plan to do. Stop. Stop now. Come back. - I love you. - Liar! You're with him! You brought him here to kill me. Let her go, Anakin. Let her go. You turned her against me! You have done that yourself. You will not take her from me! Your anger and your lust for power have already done that. You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind... until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy. Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace... freedom, justice and security to my new empire. Your new empire? Don't make me kill you. Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy! If you're not with me... then you're my enemy. Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must. You will try. I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor. Or should I call you Darth Sidious? Master Yoda. You survived. Surprised? Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience... the full power of the dark side. I have waited a long time for this moment... my little green friend. At last the Jedi are no more. Not if anything to say about it I have. At an end your rule is. And not short enough it was. If so powerful you are... why leave? You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us. Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be. As is your faith in the dark side of the Force. Hurry. Careful timing we will need. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready. There's no sign of his body, sir. - Then he is not dead. - Double your search. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate take-off. - Yes, Master. - I sense Lord Vader is in danger. Into exile I must go. Failed I have. I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you. I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over. Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil. Then you are lost! This is the end for you, my master. It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground. You underestimate my power. Don't try it. You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness! I hate you! You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you. Master Kenobi. We have Miss Padm on board. Yes. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place. Is Anakin all right? Your Majesty, this way. There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule immediately. Yes, sir. Right away. Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact. We'll take her to the medical centre. Quickly. Medically, she's completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her. - She's dying? - We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies. Babies? She's carrying twins. Luke. Oh, Luke. - It's a girl. - Leia. There's good in him. I know. I know there's... still- Lord Vader. Can you hear me? Yes, Master. Where is Padm? Is she safe? Is she all right? It seems, in your anger, you killed her. I? I couldn't have. She was alive. I felt it! Hidden, safe the children must be kept. We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence. Split up they should be. My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us. And what of the boy? To Tatooine. To his family send him. I will take the child and watch over him. Until the time is right, disappear we will. Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you. Training? An old friend has learned the path to immortality. One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force. Your old master. Qui-Gon? How to commune with him I will teach you. - Captain Antilles. - Yes, Your Highness? I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector shield will be deactivated... when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by. You are clear to proceed. We're starting our approach. [Siren] Inform the commander... that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Sir. Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader... my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you this station will be operational, as planned. The emperor does not share... your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander... and he is most displeased... with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The emperor is not as forgiving as I am. [Whistle Whistle Beep] Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca... never returned from this awful place. [Beep Beep Whistle] Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt... you'd probably short-circuit. [Whining] [Whistle Whistle] [Beep Whistle] R2, are you sure this is the right place? [Whistle Beep Beep] I'd better knock, I suppose. [Whistle] There doesn't seem to be anyone here. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. [Beep Beep] [Speaking Huttese] Goodness gracious me! [Speaking Huttese] R2-Dee Toa. [Whistle Beep] [Whistle Beep] [Speaking Huttese] [Whistle Beep Whistle] [Speaking Huttese] C- 3POA. Ay tuta mishka Jabba du Hutt? Kuja wanki mitby cosa. Ha ha ha! I don't think they're going to let us in, R2. We'd better go. [Rumble] [Creak] [Whistle] [Beep Whistle Beep] R2, wait! [Whistle] Oh, dear! R2! R2, I really don't think we should rush into all this. [Beep Beep] Oh! R2! R2, wait for me! [Whistle Beep] Grr! [Beep Beep] Grr! Just you deliver Master Luke's message... and get us out of here. Oh, my! Oh! Oh, no. [Speaking Huttese] Day wonna wonga? Oh, my! Dee wonna wygo. [Beep] We bring a message... to your master Jabba the Hutt. DayJabba wonga? [Beep Beep] And a gift. Gift? What gift? [Beep Whistle] NeJabba no barta. Eezai ohkto. [Whistle Whistle] Izzi kata o mohkti? [Beep Beep] Ne charda so dehdi. [Whistle Beep] He says that our instructions... are to give it only toJabba himself. [Whistle Whistle] Grr! Grr! I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Noht cha! R2, I have a bad feeling about this. [Whistle] Oohh! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Oohh! Cava notayce, my lord. Good morning. Ohnt bat chuay dehr attat. Oohh! The message, R2, the message. Oohh shoodah. [Whistle Whistle Beep] Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker... Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mightyJabba... and that your anger with Solo... must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness... to bargain for Solo's life. Ha ha ha! With your wisdom... I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement... which will be mutually beneficial... and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift... these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. This can't be! R2, you're playing the wrong message. Ha ha! Ah ha ha ha! Master, bargonay tua knight? He's noJedi. [Speaking Huttese] There will be no bargain. We're doomed. [Speaking Huttese] I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. R2, look... Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. [Whistle] Ah ha ha! - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! What could possibly have come over Master Luke? Was it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Ohh! How horrid! Ohh! Grr! Grr! [Whistle Whistle] Ah ah ah! Ah ah ha! Aaah! Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid... are you not? I am C-3PO... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent... in over six million forms of communication and can... Splendid. We have been without an interpreter... since our master got angry with our last protocol droid... and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Aah! Oh! Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt... and take him back up to His Excellency's main audience chamber. R2, don't leave me! Oh! [Whistle Beep Bleep] You're a feisty little one... but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's sail barge... and I think you'll fill in nicely. No! No! No! Aaahh! [Singing In Huttese] [Speaking Huttese] Ah! Do that again! [Singing In Huttese] [Singing In Huttese] Ho ho! Aah! Whoops! Uh-oh! Aah! - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! [Creaking] [Beast Growls] Aaaah! [Squeals] [Zap] Ooahhh! Aah! [Speaking Huttese] Uhh! [Speaking Ubese] I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no. Chewbacca! Aarrrrr. [Speaking Huttese] At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Kanji ta, droid. Yes, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Yes? [Speaking Huttese] The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome... and will gladly pay you... the reward of 25,000. [Speaking Ubese] I want 50,000. No less. 50,000. No less. Wah! Aah! Ohh! [Speaking Huttese] What... What did I say? [Speaking Huttese] The mightyJabba asks why he must pay 50,000. [Speaking Ubese] Because he's holding a thermal detonator! Oh! Aah! Rrrrrr! Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ah ha ha ha ha! [Speaking Huttese] This bounty hunter is my kind of scum... fearless and inventive. [Speaking Huttese] Jabba offers the sum of 35... and I do suggest you take it. [Speaking Ubese] He agrees! Arrrr! Grrr! [Playing Festive Tune] Ahh! [Speaking Huttese] [Speaking Ubese] Rrr! Arrrr! Arrrrr! Grrrr! Rrrr! Grr! Rrrrr. [Burp] [Clink Clink] [Thud] Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite. Shh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia. I got to get you out of here. Ho ho ho ho ho! What's that? Ho ho ho ho ho! I know that laugh. [Speaking Huttese] Hey, Jabba... Look, Jabba... I was just on my way to pay you back... and I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. [Speaking Huttese] It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler... but now you're Bantha fodder. Ah ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! Look... Take him away. Jabba, I'll pay you triple. You're throwing away a fortune! Don't be a fool! [Jabba Speaking Huttese] Bring her to me. We have powerful friends. You're going to regret this. I'm sure. [Slurp] Ugh! Oh, I can't bear to watch. Oh! Ah ha ha ha! Arrrrg. Chewie? Arrrr! Chewie, is that you? Rarrr! Ch-Chewie! I can't see, pal. What's going on? Ar grr arr. Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself... much less rescue anybody. Arrr rarrr. AJedi knight? I'm out of it for a little while... everybody gets delusions of grandeur. Arrra! I'm all right, pal. Arrrrrrr. I'm all right. Grrr! Grrr! Arg. Yo macka chipowan Skywalker. Jabba mo botowa tu. I must speak with Jabba. Es tosit. Jabba no tusen di hunka bi. No bargain. You will take me toJabba now. Ataka bu Jabba now. You serve your master well. Ay sota vanlocha. And you will be rewarded. A chunoh ayo ahtot. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me. Master. Oohh! Gabba nopez Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight. [Speaking Huttese] I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. [Speaking Huttese] He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! Eee! Ah! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Ho ho ho ho ho! [Speaking Huttese] Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless... I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed. It's your choice... but I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Ooahh. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Grr! Ho ho ho! TibiJedi! TibiJedi! [Creaking] Oh, no! The rancor! Grr! [Squealing] [Squealing] Grr! [Squealing] [Crunch] Ha ha ha! Grr! Grrr! Oh! Whoo-hoo! Grr! Ya! Ha! Ah ha ha! Grr! [Crunch] [Speaking Huttese] [Whining] [Speaking Huttese] [Speaking Huttese] [Speaking Huttese] Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. Han! Luke! Are you all right? Fine. Together again, huh? Wouldn't miss it. How are we doing? Same as always. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? I'm here. [Speaking Huttese] [C-3PO] Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the greatJabba the Hutt... has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. Good. I hate long waits. Oh ah ha ha ha ha! You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea... and cast into the Pit of Carkoon... the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will find... a new definition of pain and suffering... as you are slowly digested over 1,000 years. Aaarrrr! On second thought, let's pass on that. You should have bargained. [Speaking Huttese] That's the last mistake you'll ever make. Ho ho ho ho ho! Ah ha ha ha ha! [Band Playing Festive Tune] I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're going to die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh. Great. Aah! Ow! [Speaking Huttese] Soon you will learn to appreciate me. [Beep Whistle] I'm terribly sorry. R2, what are you doing here? [Bleep Beep] Well, I can see you're serving drinks... but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke... and, if we're not careful, us, too. [Beep Beep] Hmmph! I wish I had your confidence. Grrrr! Arrr. [Speaking Huttese] [C-3PO] Victims of the almighty Sarlacc... His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy... the greatJabba the Hutt... will now listen to your pleas. [Beep Beep Whistle] TibiJedi. 3PO, you tell that slimy piece... of worm-ridden filth... he'll get no such pleasure from us! Right? Grr! [Luke] Jabba... this is your last chance. Free us or die. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! [Speaking Huttese] Move him into position. [Beep Beep] Put him in. Aah! Grr! Easy, Chewie. Help! Chewie, you're hit? Where is it? Han! Chewie! Lando! Boba Fett? Boba Fett? Where? Eeyaah! Uhh! [Burp] Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Augghh! [Death Rattle] - Grab me, Chewie. - I'm slipping! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it. Gently, now. All right. Easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Eeyaah! Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. Wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right! I can see a lot better! Don't move! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, pull us up. Up, Chewie. Up. Come on. We gotta get out of here. Not my eyes! R2, help! Quickly, R2! Beast! Eh heh. Boo ba daba da! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! R2, where are we going? I couldn't possibly go... Aah! [Whistle] Come on! Let's go. And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. [Beep Whistle Whistle] [Whistle] I'll meet you back at the fleet. [Leia] Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. [Han] Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for coming after me. Now I owe you one. [Whistle Beep] That's right, R2. We're going to the Dagobah system. [Whistle] I have a promise to keep... to an old friend. Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You've done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue... your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my master. Patience, my friend. In time, he will seek you out. And when he does... you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him... to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. Ha ha ha ha! [Beep Whistle] That face you make... Look I so old to young eyes? No, of course not. I do. Yes, I do. Sick have I become. Old and weak. When 900 years old you reach... Iook as good you will not, hmm? Heh heh heh. Soon will I rest. Yes. Forever sleep. Earned it I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong. Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi. Oh! [Laughs, Coughs] Not yet. One thing remains... Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Rest I need. Yes. Rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is. And unfortunate. Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training... that not ready for the burden were you. I'm sorry. Remember... a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware... Anger, fear... aggression... the dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path... forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke... Luke... do not... do not underestimate the powers of the emperor... or suffer your father's fate you will. Luke... when gone am I... the last of theJedi will you be. Luke... the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned. Luke... there is... another... Sk... Sky... walker. [Beep Beep] I can't do it, R2. [Beep Whistle] I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan. Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader... betrayed and murdered my father. Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker... and became Darth Vader. When that happened... the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view? Luke, you're going to find... that many of the truths we cling to... depend greatly on our own point of view. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him... your father was already a great pilot... but I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There is still good in him. He's more machine now than man... twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. You must face Darth Vader again. I can't kill my own father. Then the emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the emperor... you were hidden from your father when you were born. The emperor knew, as I did... if Anakin were to have any offspring... they would be a threat to him. That is the reason... why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit... but they could be made to serve the emperor. Well, look at you... a general, huh? Someone must have told them about my little maneuver... at the Battle ofTanaab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were looking for somebody... to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Who says they didn't? But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? [Chimes] The emperor's made a critical error... and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies... pinpoint the exact location... of the emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star... are not yet operational. With the imperial fleet... spread throughout the galaxy... in a vain effort to engage us... it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all... we've learned that the emperor himself... is personally overseeing the final stages... of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please. You can see here the Death Star... orbiting the forest moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star... are not yet operational... the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield... which is generated... from the nearby forest moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated... if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down... our cruisers will create a perimeter... while the fighters fly into the superstructure... and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack. Good luck. You're going to need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship... and using a secret imperial code... a strike team will land on the moon... and deactivate the shield generator. [C-3PO] Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Arrr! It's going to be rough, pal. I didn't wanna speak for you. Arr! That's one. General... count me in. I'm with you, too. What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han, Chewie. [Whistle] \"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would choose. Look, I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise. Not a scratch. Would you get going, you pirate? Good luck. You, too. Got her warmed? She's coming up. Arr! Yeah, well, I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind... when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, you awake? Yeah. I just got a funny feeling... like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. [Whistle] Here we go again. All right, hang on. What is thy bidding, my master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the rebellion will be crushed... and young Skywalker will be one of us. Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my master. If they don't go for this... we're gonna have to get out of here pretty quick, Chewie. Arrrr! [Radio] We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation... of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium... transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now, don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance, though, Chewie... but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. Arrrr?! I don't know. Fly casual. Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Let's keep a little optimism here. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not going for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium... deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. O.K. I told you it was going to work. No problem. Oh, I told you it was dangerous here! Should we try and go around? It'll take time. This whole party will be for nothing if they see us. Arr! Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. Quietly. There might be more of them out there. Hey, it's me. [Snap] Go for help! Go! Great. Come on! Over there! Two more of them. I see them. Wait, Leia! Hey, wait! Quick. Jam their comlink! Center switch! Move closer! Get alongside that one! Oh! Keep on that one! I'll take these two! Aah! Aah! [Whistle Beep Beep] General Solo, somebody's coming. Urrr! Oh! Luke! Arrr! Where's Leia? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. We better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. [Luke] Come on, R2, we'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Eek. Eek! Cut it out! Grrrrr. Rrrr. [Speaking Ewokese] Arrr. Arrr. I'm not going to hurt you. Oh. [Speaking Ewokese] Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is. Maybe you can help me. Come on. Sit down. Grrrrr. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. Grrrrr! All right. You want something to eat? [Speaking Ewokese] That's right. - Come on. - [Speaking Ewokese] Hmm? [Sniff Sniff] [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] Ya! Yee! [Speaking Ewokese] Look. It's a hat. It's not going to hurt you. Look. Arrr. [Speaking Ewokese] You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? Ooooh! [Sniff Sniff] What is it? [Speaking Ewokese] [Sniff Sniff Sniff] [Speaking Ewokese] [Zap] Oh! [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] Freeze! Come on, get up! Grrrrr! Go get your ride. Take her back to base. Yes, sir. Rrrooh! What the... Ya! [Speaking Ewokese] Come on. Let's get out of here. [Speaking Ewokese] I told you to remain on the command ship. A small rebel force... has penetrated the shield... and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. [Emperor] Are you sure? I have felt him, my master. Strange that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear... Lord Vader. They are clear, my master. Then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for him. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you... and then you will bring him before me. As you wish. Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. Arrrrr. There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this. I'm afraid that R2's sensors... can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's all right. Arrrrr! Arrrrr! What, Chewie? Arrrrr! What, Chewie? Arrrrrrrr. Arrrr. Arrr. I don't get it. It's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wait! Don't! Aah! [Han] Nice work. Arrrrr! Great, Chewie. Great. Always thinking with your stomach. Take it easy. Let's just figure a way... to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah. Sure. [Whistle Beep Beep] R2, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long drop! Ah. [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] What... Hey! Point that thing someplace else. [Arguing In Ewokese] Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. [Speaking Ewokese] Chewie, give them your crossbow. Arrrrr! Oh, my head! [Speaking Ewokese] Oh, my goodness. [Speaking Ewokese] [Chanting In Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke. Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms... What are you telling them? Hello, I think. I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. I do believe they think I am some sort of god. [Beep Beep] Haaaar! Why don't you use your divine influence... and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper? It's against my programming... to impersonate a deity. Why, you... [Ewoks Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] My mistake. He's an old friend of mine. Jabba jabba jabba. Ow! Hey! [Squeak] Rrrr. Arrrr! I have a really bad feeling about this. [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo... but it appears you are to be the main course... at a banquet in my honor. Arrrrr! [Singing In Ewokese] Leia! Leia! [Speaking Ewokese] Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. [Singing In Ewokese] 3PO, tell them they must be set free. Arrrrr! [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] Eee! Ya! Ya! Ya! Somehow I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. 3PO, tell them if they don't do as you wish... you'll become angry and use your magic. But, Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly. Just tell them. [Speaking Ewokese] Boom! [Speaking Ewokese] You see, Master Luke? They didn't believe me... just as I said they wouldn't. Wait, wait. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Eee! Put me down! Help! Somebody! Somebody, help! Master Luke! R2, R2, quickly! Oh! Oh! [Speaking Ewokese] [Beep Beep Whistle] Oh! Aah! - Ooh! - Ooh! Thank goodness. [Whistle Beep] Thanks, 3PO. I never knew I had it in me. Woochana makawartas, woochana makawartas. Nervrenda bootootoo Tatooine. Faraway, mana quitoo. Princess Leia wasay wapa R2.

[Beep Beep Beep] Short help's better than no help at all. He says the scouts are going to show us... the quickest way to the shield generator. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. [Speaking Ewokese] Try and get our weapons back. [Speaking Ewokese] Hurry up, will you? I haven't got all day. Luke, what's wrong? Leia, do you remember your mother... your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was... very beautiful. Kind... but sad. Why are you asking me this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me... what's troubling you? Vader is here. Now. On this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay... I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back... you're the only hope for the Alliance. Don't talk that way. You have a power I don't understand... and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power, too. In time, you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. And... my sister has it. Yes. It's you, Leia. I know. Somehow... I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him. No! Luke, run away. Far away. If he can feel your presence... then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But why must you confront him? Because... there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's going on? Nothing. I just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's going on? I... I can't tell you. Could you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ah. I'm sorry. Hold me. This is the rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them... and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search... and bring his companions to me. Yes, my lord. The emperor has been expecting you. I know, Father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth... that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me. It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That was why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed you are powerful... as the emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn... and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny. Search your feelings, Father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate. It is too late for me, son. The emperor will show you... the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead. Urrr. The main entrance to the control bunker... is on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't going to be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places... more heavily guarded than this. [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] [Leia] What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance... on the other side of the ridge. Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. [Speaking Alien Language] Don't worry. My friend's down there. He'll have that shield down on time. [Speaking Alien Language] Or this will be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump into hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by. [Whistle] [Speaking Ewokese] Back door, huh? Good idea. [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] It only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet like. Oh, my! Princess Leia! I'm afraid our furry companion... has gone and done something rather rash. Rrrrooohh. Oh, no. [Han] There goes our surprise attack. [Starts Engine] Look, over there! Stop him! Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided... that we shall stay here. Whoo-whoo! Yahoo! Whoo whoo! Wa ha ha ha! Wa ha ha ha! Hey! Yoooaww! Ooohm. Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You'll no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time, you will call me master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken... about a great many things. [Vader] His lightsaber. Ah, yes. AJedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know... your father can never be turned... from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead, and you with me. Ha ha ha ha! Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack... of your rebel fleet. Yes. I assure you... we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. [Vader] It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired... has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the sanctuary moon... are walking into a trap, as is your rebel fleet. It was I who allowed the Alliance... to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh... I'm afraid the deflector shield... will be quite operational when your friends arrive. All right, up! Move! Come on. Quickly. Quickly. Chewie. Grr! Han, hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! [Speaking Ewokese] Wait! Wait! Come back! [Speaking Ewokese] R2, stay with me. Freeze! Aah! You rebel scum. Uhh waahh! Uhh! Ahh yaa! All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. [Speaking Alien Language] We've got to get a reading... on that shield. [Speaking Alien Language] How could they be jamming us... if they don't know... if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. You sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action. Green Group, stick to Holding Sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in Sector 47. It's a trap! Fighters coming in! There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed. Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader. Come, boy. See for yourself. From here, you will witness... the final destruction of the Alliance... and the end of your insignificant rebellion. You want this... don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take yourJedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment... you make yourself more my servant. No. It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father... are now... mine. All right, move it! Keep moving. Come on. Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Grr! Bring those two down here. Well, they're on their way. R2, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. - Aiyee! - Haa! Whoo! Whoo! - Aiyee! - Yaah! - Aiyee! - Haa! The code's changed. We need R2. Here's the terminal. R2, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. What do you mean, you're going? [Bleep Boop] Going where, R2? No, wait! This is no time for heroics! Come back! Watch yourself, Wedge. Three from above. Red 3, Red 2, pull in. Got it. Three of them coming in, 20 degrees. Cut to the left. I'll take the leader. They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Stardestroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping. As you can see, my young apprentice... your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower... of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire. Oh! That blast came from the Death Star. That thing's operational! Home 1, this is Gold Leader. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time. We're coming! Aah! Come on, come on! Oh, R2, hurry! Yeeoooww! Oh, my goodness! [Blip Blip Beep Beep] Why did you have to be so brave? Eeooow... Well, I suppose I could hot-wire this thing. I'll cover you. [Speaking Ewokese] [Speaking Ewokese] Yes, I said closer. Move as close as you can and engage those Stardestroyers... at point-blank range! At that close range, we won't last long... against those Stardestroyers. We'll last longer than we will against that Death Star! And we might just take a few of them with us. She's going to blow! I'm hit! Your fleet is lost... and your friends on the Endor moon... will not survive. There is no escape... my young apprentice. The Alliance will die... as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon. Strike me down with all of your hatred... and your journey towards the dark side... will be complete! Ha ha ha ha ha! [Speaking Ewokese] Ah... eeyaheeyah... eeyaheeyah! Look! Get him off of there! Aaah! Yahoo! Yeeha! Yaaa! Yeehaha! I think I got it. I got it! Aah! Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. - Freeze! - Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Arrr! Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait! I got an idea. Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy. Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, Father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, Father. I feel the good in you, the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before. I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate... the power of the dark side. If you will not fight... then you will meet your destiny. [Emperor] Good. Good. Watch out! Squad at.06. I'm on it, Gold Leader. Good shot, Red 2. We're sure in the middle of it now. Come on, Han, old buddy, don't let me down. It's over, Commander. The rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Throw me another charge. You cannot hide forever, Luke. [Luke] I will not fight you. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes. Your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong... especially for... sister. So... you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side... then perhaps she will. Never! Ha ha ha ha ha! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now... fulfill your destiny... and take your father's place at my side. Never. I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi... like my father before me. So be it... Jedi. Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor! We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. I told you they'd do it! If you will not be turned... you will be destroyed. Young fool. Only now, at the end... do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match... for the power of the dark side. Aaah! You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Aaah! Father, please! Ow! Aaah! Help me! Aaah! Now, young Skywalker... you will die. Aahh! Ow! Aaah! Aaah! Aaaahhhhh! [Labored Breathing] I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. Stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TI E fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Stardestroyer. Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shields. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through! Intensify forward firepower! Aaah! Too late! [Cheering And Applause] Luke. Help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now... go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I'll not leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right. You were right about me. Tell your sister... you were right. Father. I won't leave you. There it is. All right, Wedge, go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star. Yee-ha! Yah. - Yaaa! - Ya! [Beep! Beep! Beep!] They did it! I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew. He wasn't. I can feel it. You love him. Don't you? Yes. All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back... I won't get in the way. It's not like that at all. He's my brother. [Speaking Ewokese] Wesa free! [Singing In Ewokese]\n                    "}, "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menice": {"transcript": "\n\n                        - Captain. - Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect... the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately. Yes, of course. As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal... and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors. I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please. We are greatly honoured by your visit, Ambassadors. Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly. I have a bad feeling about this. - I don't sense anything. - It's not about the mission, Master. It's something elsewhere, elusive. Don't centre on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs. But Master Yoda said I should be mindful of the future. But not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, young Padawan. Yes, Master. How do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands? These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short. What? What did you say? The ambassadors are Jedi knights, I believe. I knew it. They're here to force a settlement. Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious. Are you brain-dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi. Send a droid. Is it in their nature to make us wait this long? No. I sense an unusual amount of fear... for something as trivial as this trade dispute. What is it? This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is fnished. We dare not go against these Jedi. Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again. This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops. My lord, is that legal? I will make it legal. And the Jedi? The chancellor should never have brought them into this. Kill them immediately. Yes, my lord. As you wish. Captain, look! Shields... Sorry. Dioxis. They must be dead by now. Destroy what's left of them. Oh! Excuse me. - Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you. - Roger, roger. Uh-oh. Blast them. What is going on down there? We lost the transmission, sir. Have you ever encountered a Jedi knight before, sir? Well, no, but I don't... Seal off the bridge. - Yes, sir. - That won't be enough, sir. I want droidekas up here at once! We will not survive this. Close the blast doors! That will hold them. They are still coming through. This is impossible! Where are those droidekas? Master! Destroyers! They have shield generators! It's a standoff. Let's go. They're no match for droidekas. Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft. - Battle droids. - It's an invasion army. This is an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet. You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short. Sir, a transmission from the planet. It's Queen Amidala herself. At last we are getting results. Again you come before us, Your Highness. You will not be so pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy. Your trade boycott of our planet has ended. I was not aware of such failure. I have word that the chancellor's ambassadors are with you now... and that you have been commanded to reach settlement. I know nothing of any ambassadors. You must be mistaken. Beware, Viceroy. The Federation has gone too far this time. We would never do anything without the approval of the senate. You assume too much. We will see. - She's right. The senate will never... - It's too late now. - Do you think she suspects an attack? - I don't know. But we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there. Negotiations haven't started because the ambassadors aren't there? How could that be true? I have assurances from the chancellor his ambassadors did arrive. It must... handiwork... negotiate... ambassadors... - nobody would... - Senator Palpatine. What's happening? Check the transmission generator. A communications disruption can mean only one thing: Invasion. The Federation would not dare go that far. The senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be fnished. We must continue to rely on negotiation. Negotiation? We've lost all communications. And where are the chancellor's ambassadors? This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match... against a battle-hardened Federation army. I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war. - Yes, Viceroy? - Captain, we've searched the ship... and there is no trace of theJedi. They may have gotten on one of your landing craft. If they're down here, sir, we'll fnd them. Use caution. TheseJedi are not to be underestimated. - Oh, no! - Get away! Get out of here! Get down! Was'n dat? Hey, wait! Oh, mooie-mooie, I love you. You almost got us killed. Are you brainless? I spake. The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. - Now, get out of here. - No, no, mesa stay. Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks. Mesa your humble servant. - That won't be necessary. - Oh, but it 'tis. 'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis. - Oh, no! - Stay down! You saved my again. - What's this? - A local. Let's get out of here before more droids show up. More? \"More\" did you spake? Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest safest place would be Gunga City. Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city. - A city? - Uh-huh. Can you take us there? On second thought, no. - Not really, no. - No? 'Tis embarrassing... but my afraid my've been banished. My forgotten. Da bosses would do terrible tings to me. Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare. - You hear that? - Yah. That is the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way. If they fnd us, they will crush us... grind us into tiny pieces and blast us into oblivion. Oh. Yousa point is well seen. Dis way. Hurry! - How much further? - Wesa goen underwater, okeyday? Ah, my warning you. Gungans no liken outsiders, so don't spect a warm welcome. Don't worry. This hasn't been our day for warm welcomes. Yousa follow me now, okeyday? So good bein home! Hey, yousa. Stopa dare. Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals. Mesa back. Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada bosses. Yousa in big dudu dis time. How wude. Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of Mackineeks up dare is new weesong. A droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them. Wesa no like da Naboo. Da Naboo tink day so smarty. Day tink day brains so big. Once those droids take control of the surface, they will take control of you. Mesa no tink so. Day not know of uss-en. You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to one of you will affect the other. You must understand this. Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo. Then speed us on our way. Wesa ganna speed yous away. We could use a transport. Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speediest way tooda Naboo... 'tis goen through the planet core. Now... go. Thank you for your help. We leave in peace. Master, what's a bongo? A transport, I hope. Deysa setten yousa up. Goen through da planet core? Bad bombin'. Any help here would be hot. Master, we're short on time. We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This Gungan may be of help. What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here? Hisen to be pune-ished. I saved his life. He owes me what you call a \"life-debt.\" Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now. Binks... yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen? Begone wit him! Count me outta dis one. Better dead here than dead in da core. Yee gods! What mesa sayin? Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfsh! - Why were you banished, Jar Jar? - It's a longo tale-o... buta a small part of it would be mesa... clumsy. - You were banished for being clumsy? - Yousa might'n be sayin dat. Mesa caused mabee one two-y lettle bitty axadentes, huh? Yud-say boom da gasser... den crashin der boss's heyblibber, den banished. Big gooberfsh! Huge-o teeth! - There's always a bigger fsh. - Mesa tink we goen back now. The invasion is on schedule, my lord. I have the senate bogged down in procedures. They will have no choice but to accept your control of the system. The queen has great faith that the senate will side with her. Queen Amidala is young and naive. You will find controlling her will not be difficult. Yes, my lord. You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi. No need to report that to him until we have something to report. - Where wesa goin? - Don't worry. The Force will guide us. Oh, maxi big, da Force. Well, dat smells stinkowiff. - We're losing power. - Oh, no! Wesa dyin' here. - Just relax. We're not in trouble yet. - What \"yet\"? Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here. All sink'n and no power? Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble? Power's back. Monster's back! Relax. You overdid it. Head for that outcropping. Oh, boy. Viceroy, we have captured the queen. Ah, victory. Dis'n loverly. How will you explain this invasion to the senate? The queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I have assurances it will be ratifed by the senate. - I will not cooperate. - Now, now, Your Highness. In time, your people's suffering will persuade you to see our point of view. - Commander. - Yes, sir. Process them. Captain, take them to Camp 4. Roger, roger. We should leave the street, Your Highness. Get their weapons. Yousa guys bombad! We're ambassadors for the supreme chancellor. Your negotiations seemed to have failed, Ambassador. The negotiations never took place. It's urgent that we make contact with the Republic. They've knocked out all our communications. - Do you have transports? - In the main hangar. This way. - There are too many of them. - That won't be a problem. Your Highness, under the circumstances, I suggest you come to Coruscant with us. Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is with my people. - They will kill you if you stay. - They wouldn't dare. They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion legal. They can't afford to kill her. There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There's no logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you. Our only hope is for the senate to side with us. Senator Palpatine will need your help. Either choice presents great danger... to us all. We are brave, Your Highness. If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now. Then I will plead our case to the senate. Be careful, Governor. We'll need to free those pilots. I'll deal with that. Halt. I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor. I'm taking these people to Coruscant. - Where are you taking them? - To Coruscant. Coruscant? Uh, that doesn't compute. Uh, wait. Uh, you're under arrest. Come on. Move! Go! Now, stay here and keep out of trouble. Hello, boyos. There's the blockade. The shield generator's been hit! How wude! We're losing droids fast. If we can't get the shield generator fxed, we'll be sitting ducks. The shields are gone. The power's back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main power drive. Deflector shields up at maximum. There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking. We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship. Here, Master. Tatooine. It's small, out of the way, poor. The Trade Federation have no presence there. How can you be sure? It's controlled by the Hutts. You can't take Her Royal Highness there. The Hutts are gangsters. - If they discovered her... - It'd be no different than landing... on a system controlled by the Federation... except that the Hutts aren't looking for her... which gives us the advantage. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty? She has disappeared, my lord. One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade. I want that treaty signed. My lord... it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range. Not for a Sith. This is my apprentice... Darth Maul. He will find your lost ship. This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them. We should not have made this bargain. An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives. It is to be commended. What is its number? R2-D2, Your Highness. Thank you, R2-D2. Padm. Clean this droid up as best you can. It deserves our gratitude. Continue, Captain. Your Highness, with your permission... we're heading for a remote planet called Tatooine. It's in a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. I do not agree with the Jedi on this. You must trust my judgment, Your Highness. Hello. Sorry. Husa are yousa? I'm Padm. Mesa Jar Jar Binks. You're a Gungan, aren't you? - How'd you end up here with us? - My no know. Mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning munchen. Den boom! Getten berry scared... and grabben dat Jedi, and pow... mesa here. Mesa getten berry, berry scared. - That's it... Tatooine. - There's a settlement. Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract attention. The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master. We'll need a new one. That'll complicate things. Be wary. - I sense a disturbance in the Force. - I feel it also, Master. Don't let them send any transmissions. The sun doen murder to mesa skin. Wait! Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you. No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. The spaceport is not going to be pleasant. The queen wishes it. She's curious about the planet. This is not a good idea. Stay close to me. Moisture farms, for the most part. Some indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one... are havens for those that don't wish to be found. Like us. Dissen berry, berry bad. Icky, icky goo! We'll try one of the smaller dealers. Good day to you. What do you want? I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian. Ah, yes! Nubian. We have lots of that. Boy, get in here now! My droid has a readout of what I need. What took you so long? I was cleaning the fan switches. Watch the store. I've got some selling to do. So, let me take thee out back, huh? We'll fnd what you need. Don't touch anything. - Are you an angel? - What? An angel. I heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They live on the moons of lego, I think. You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much? I listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here. I'm a pilot, you know, and someday I'm gonna fly away from this place. - You're a pilot? - Mm-hmm. All my life. How long have you been here? Since I was very little. Three, I think. My mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt... but she lost us betting on the Podraces. You're a slave? - I'm a person, and my name is Anakin. - I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. This is a strange place to me. - I got ya. - Hey! Hit the nose. A T-14 hyperdrive generator. Thee in luck. I'm the only one hereabouts who has one. But thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think, huh. Saying of which... how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh? I have 20,000 Republic dataries. Republic credits? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real. I don't have anything else, but credits will do fne. - No, they won't. - Credits will do fne. No, they won't! What, you think you're some kind of Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don't work on me. Only money. No money, no parts, no deal. And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that. Wouldn't have lasted long anyways if I wasn't so good at building things. We're leaving. Jar Jar. I'm glad to have met you, Anakin. I was glad to meet you too. Outlanders. They think we know nothing. They seemed nice to me. Clean the racks. Then you can go home. Yippee! And you're sure there's nothing left on board? A few containers of supplies. The queen's wardrobe, maybe, but not enough for you to barter with... not in the amount you're talking about. All right. I'm sure another solution will present itself. I'll check back later. Noah gain. Noah gain. Da beings hereabouts, cawazy! Wesa be wobbed un crunched. Not likely. We have nothing of value. That's our problem. Are you going to pay for that? It costs seven wupiupi. Oops. Is this yours? Who, mesa... Careful, Sebulba. He's a big-time outlander. I'd hate to see you diced before we race again. Next time we race, boy, it will be the end of you. If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now. Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me. - Hi. - Hi there. Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fght with a Dug... an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba. Mesa haten crunchen. Das da las ting mesa want. Nevertheless, the boy is right. You were heading into trouble. Thanks, my young friend. But mesa doen nutten! This storm will slow them down. Looks pretty bad. - Panaka. - Receiving a message from home. We'll be right there. Here, you'll like these pallies. - Here. - Thank you. My bones are aching. Storm's coming up, Ani. You better get home quick. - Do you have shelter? - We'll head back to our ship. - Is it far? - It's on the outskirts. You'll never reach the outskirts in time. Sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come on. I'll take you to my place. Mom! - Mom, I'm home! - Ah, dissen cosy. - These are my friends, Mom. - Hello. - I'm Qui-Gon Jinn. - I'm building a droid. You wanna see? Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter. Come on. I'll show you 3PO. Isn't he great? He's not fnished yet. He's wonderful. You really like him? He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch. Where is everybody? Whoops. Oh, hello. I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations. How might I serve you? - He's perfect. - Oh. Perfect. When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer. I'm building a Podracer. I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable. Hello. I don't believe we have been introduced. R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you. I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations. I beg your pardon, but what do you mean, \"naked\"? My parts are showing? My goodness! The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me. It's a trick. Send no reply. Send no transmissions of any kind. It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace. What if it is true, and the people are dying? Either way, we're running out of time. Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will fnd them quickly, Master. Move against the Jedi frst. You will then have no diffculty in taking the queen to Naboo... to sign the treaty. At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge. You have been well-trained, my young apprentice. They will be no match for you. All slaves have a transmitter placed inside their bodies somewhere. I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine. - Any attempt to escape... - And they blow you up! How wude! I can't believe there's still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's antislavery laws... The Republic doesn't exist out here. We must survive on our own. Xcuse me. Has anybody ever seen a Podrace? They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous. I'm the only human who can do it. You must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods. Don't do that again. You're a Jedi knight, aren't you? - What makes you think that? - I saw your laser sword. Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon. Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him. I don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi. I wish that were so. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves. - Have you come to free us? - No, I'm afraid not. I think you have. Why else would you be here? I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin. We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic... on a very important mission. How did you end up out here in the outer rim? Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it. I can help. I can fx anything. I believe you can. But frst we must acquire the parts we need. Wit no-nutten mula to trade. These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind. Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races. Podracing. Greed can be a powerful ally. I built a racer. It's the fastest ever. There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. - Anakin, Watto won't let you. - Watto doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it was yours... and get him to let me pilot it for you. I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it. But, Mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. Anakin. Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who can help us? No. Mom, you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other. I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll fnd some other way. There is no other way. I may not like it, but he can help you. He was meant to help you. Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know? The queen will not approve. The queen doesn't need to know. Well, I don't approve. The boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race. How can you do this? Not on the Republic credits, I think. My ship will be the entry fee. Not bad! Not bad, huh? Nubian, huh? It's in good order, except for the parts I need. What would the boy ride? He smashed up my pod in the last race. It would take some long time to fx it. It wasn't my fault. Really. Sebulba flashed me with his vents. I actually saved the pod, mostly. That you did. The boy's good. No doubts there, huh? I have acquired a pod in a game of chance. The fastest ever built. I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh? So, you supply the pod and the entry fee... and I supply the boy. We split the winnings 50-50, I think, huh? If it's going to be 50-50... I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win... you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need. And if we lose, you keep my ship. Either way, you win. Deal! Your friend is a foolish one, methinks. What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here a very long time. Well, it's too dangerous to call for help... and a ship without a power supply isn't going to get us anywhere. And... there's something about this boy. You should be very proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward. He knows nothing of greed. He has... He has special powers. Yes. He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It's a Jedi trait. He deserves better than a slave's life. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identifed him early. The Force is unusually strong with him. That much is clear. Who was his father? There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him. I can't explain what happened. Can you help him? I don't know. I didn't actually come here to free slaves. Wow, a real astro droid! - How do you get so lucky? - That isn't the half of it. - I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow. - What? With this? You're such a joker, Ani. - You've been working on that for years. - It's never gonna run. Come on. Let's go and play ball. Keep racing, Ani. You're gonna be bug squash. Keep away from those energy binders. If your hand gets caught in the beam, it's gonna go numb for hours. Okay. My tongue is fat. My tongue... Wrench. Where is de wrench? Oh, dare it is. I'm stuck. You know, I fnd that Jar Jar creature to be a little odd. You don't even know if this thing's gonna run. - It will. - I think it's time we found out. - Here, use this power charge. - Yes, sir! Come on, Kitster. Let's move away. My mouth. Ani, I'm stuck. My tongue is fat. You're quite right. He's very odd indeed. Thank you. Go. It's working! It's working! Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut. There's so many. Do they all have a system of planets? Most of them. Has anyone been to 'em all? Not likely. I wanna be the frst one to see 'em all. Ani, bedtime! There we are. Good as new. Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again. - What are you doing? - Checking your blood for infections. Go on. You have a big day tomorrow. Sleep well, Ani. - Obi-Wan? - Yes, Master? I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you. Wait a minute. I need a midi-chlorian count. The reading is off the chart. Over 20,000. Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high. No Jedi has. What does that mean? I'm not sure. I wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over. Patience, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set. And we'll be far away from here. Not if your ship belongs to me, I think, huh? I warn you, no funny business. - You don't think Anakin can win? - Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race... but Sebulba there is going to win, I think. Oh, no! Why do you think that? He always wins! I am betting heavily on Sebulba. - I'll take that bet. - What? I'll wager my new racing pod against, say... the boy and his mother. No pod is worth two slaves, not by a long shot. The boy, then. We'll let fate decide, huh? I just happen to have a chance cube here. Blue, it's the boy. Red... his mother. You won this small toss, outlander... but you won't win the race! So it makes little difference! Better stop your friend's betting or I'll end up owning him too. - What'd he mean by that? - I'll tell you later. Good morning. Oh, my. Space travel sounds rather perilous. I can assure you, they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships. This is so wizard, Ani. I'm sure you'll do it this time. Do what? Finish the race, of course. You've never won a race? Well, not exactly. Not even fnished? Kitster's right. I will this time. Of course you will. That's absolutely right. And a big turnout here from all corners of the outer rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid. I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System. Two-time winner Boles Roor. Sebulba! And in the front row, nearside pole position... Mawhonic! A hearty hello... to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp! And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt... with that incredible racing machine, the Vulptereen 327. And hoping for a big win today... Ody Mandrell, with his record-setting pit droid team. And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker... a local boy. I see the flags are moving out onto the track. Be safe. I will, Mom. I promise. You won't walk away from this one... you slave scum. Don't count on it, slime ball. You're bantha fodder! - You all set, Ani? - Yep. Right. Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel, don't think. Use your instincts. I will. May the Force be with you. Jabba the Hutt. Welcome. Begin the race! Hey, looks like they're clearing the grid. - Is he nervous? - He's fne. You Jedi are far too reckless. The queen is not... The queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too. You assume too much. Start your engines. Oh, dissen gonna be messy. Me no watch'n! Oh, no! Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled. It looks like Quadinaros is having engine trouble also. Come on, Ani! And there goes Skywalker! Go, Ani, go! He will be hard-pressed to catch up with the leaders. Looks like a few Tusken Raiders are camped out... on the canyon dune turn. There goes Quadinaros' power coupling. Oh, no! Where is Master Anakin? Look. Here he comes. It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field. Yay! Yippee! He has to complete two more circuits? Oh, dear. Skywalker's spinning out of control! I don't care what universe you're from. That's gotta hurt! Here he comes! At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba's in the lead... followed closely by Skywalker! Go, Ani! Skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp! It's Skywalker! Sebulba! Amazing! A quick control thrust, and he's back on course! Did he crash-ed? Skywalker's in trouble! Sebulba takes the lead! He's catching Sebulba! Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani! That little human being is out of his mind! They're side by side! - Yippee! - Yay! I can't believe it. The crowds are going nuts! Yay, Ani! Mom, I did it! Yay! Good going, Ani! We owe you everything, Ani. It's so wonderful, Ani. You have brought hope to those who have none. I'm so very proud of you. You! You swindled me. You knew the boy was going to win. Somehow you knew it. I lost everything. Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you lose. Bring the parts to the main hangar. I'll come by your shop later on so you can release the boy. You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet. Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts? I'm sure they can settle this. Take him. Hidoe! Well, we have all the essential parts we need. I'm going back. Some unfnished business. I won't be long. Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life-form? It's the boy who's responsible for getting us these parts. Get this hyperdrive generator installed. Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long. Come on. Hup! Hey. These are yours. Yes! Mom, we sold the pod! Look at all the money we have! My goodness! But that's so wonderful, Ani. - And he has been freed. - What? You're no longer a slave. Did you hear that? Now you can make your dreams come true, Ani. You are free. Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi? Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident. You mean I get to come with you in your starship? Anakin... training to become a Jedi is not an easy challenge... and even if you succeed, it's a hard life. But I wanna go. It's what I've always dreamed of doing. Can I go, Mom? Anakin... this path has been placed before you. The choice is yours alone. I wanna do it. Then pack your things. We haven't much time. What about Mom? Is she free too? I tried to free your mother, Ani, but Watto wouldn't have it. You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom? Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go. I don't want things to change. But you can't stop the change... any more than you can stop the suns from setting. I love you. Now hurry. Thank you. I'll watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right? Yeah. Hello, Master Anakin. Well, 3PO, I've been freed... and I'm going away in a starship. Master Anakin, you are my maker and I wish you well. However, I should prefer it if I were a little more completed. I'm sorry I wasn't able to fnish you, 3PO... give you coverings and all. I'm gonna miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Sell me? Bye. Oh, my. I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it. Will I ever see you again? What does your heart tell you? I hope so. Yes. I guess. Then we will see each other again. I will come back and free you, Mom. I promise. Now, be brave... and don't look back. Don't look back. Qui-Gon, sir, wait! - I'm tired! - Anakin! Drop! Go! Tell them to take off! Qui-Gon's in trouble. Take off. Over there. Fly low. - Are you all right? - I think so. What was it? I'm not sure... but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is it was after the queen. What are we gonna do about it? We shall be patient. Anakin Skywalker... meet Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you. Your queen is lost, your people are starving... and you, Governor, are going to die... much sooner than your people, I'm afraid. This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided. Take him away. My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps... for these rumoured underwater villages. They will not stay hidden for long. The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me. You all right? It's very cold. You come from a warm planet, Ani. A little too warm for my taste. Space is cold. You seem sad. The queen is worried. Her people are suffering, dying. She must convince the senate to intervene or... I'm not sure what'll happen. I made this for you... so you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet. It'll bring you good fortune. It's beautiful. But I don't need this to remember you by. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani... but my caring for you will remain. I care for you, too, only l... Miss your mother. Coruscant. The entire planet is one big city. There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle. And look over there. Senator Palpatine is waiting for us. It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. With the communications breakdown, we've been very concerned. I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum. Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honour to fnally meet you in person. Thank you, Supreme Chancellor. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the current situation. I've called for a special session of the senate to hear your position. I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor. There is a question of procedure... but I'm confdent we can overcome it. I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately. The situation has become much more complicated. Ani, come on. Da queen's a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. Pitty hot. There is no civility, only politics. The Republic is not what it once was. The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good. I must be frank, Your Majesty. There is little chance the senate will act on the invasion. Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope. If I may say so, Your Majesty... the chancellor has little real power. He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. - The bureaucrats are in charge now. - What options have we? Our best choice would be to push for the election... of a stronger supreme chancellor... one who could control the bureaucrats... and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confdence in Chancellor Valorum. He has been our strongest supporter. Our only other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts. The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate. Our people are dying, Senator. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation. To be realistic, Your Majesty... I think we're going to have to accept Federation control... for the time being. That is something I cannot do. He was trained in the Jedi arts. My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord. Impossible. The Sith have been extinct for a millennium. I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing. Hard to see, the dark side is. We will use all our resources to unravel this mystery. We will discover the identity of your attacker. May the Force be with you. Master Qui-Gon. More to say have you? With your permission, my master... I have encountered a vergence in the Force. A vergence, you say. Located around a person? A boy. His cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians... I have seen in a life-form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians. You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the Force. You believe it's this boy? - I don't presume to... - But you do. Revealed your opinion is. I request the boy be tested, Master. Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm? Finding him was the will of the Force. I have no doubt of that. Bring him before us, then. The boy's here to see Padm. Let him in. I'm sorry, Ani, but Padm's not here right now. Who is it? Anakin Skywalker to see Padm, Your Highness. I've sent Padm on an errand. I'm on my way to the Jedi temple... to start my training, I hope. I may never see her again, so I came to say goodbye. We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you. Thank you, Your Highness. The chair recognizes the senator from the sovereign system of Naboo. Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the senate... a tragedy has occurred... which started right here with the taxation of trade routes... and has now engulfed our entire planet... in the oppression of the Trade Federation. This is outrageous! I object to the senator's statements. The chair does not recognize the senator from the Trade Federation at this time. To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala... recently elected ruler of the Naboo... who speaks on our behalf. Honourable representatives of the Republic... I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade... I object! There is no proof! This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth. The Congress of Malastare... concurs with the honourable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed. - The point... - Excuse me, Chancellor. Enter the bureaucrat. The true rulers of the Republic. And on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear. The point is conceded. Will you defer your motion to allow a commission... to explore the validity of your accusations? I will not defer. I've come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die... while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action... I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a vote of no confdence... in Chancellor Valorum's leadership. Vote now! Vote now! Order! Now they will elect a new chancellor... a strong chancellor... one who will not let our tragedy continue. The boy will not pass the council's test, Master. He's too old. Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you. Do not defy the council, Master, not again. I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan. If you would just follow the code, you would be on the council. They will not go along with you this time. You still have much to learn, my young apprentice. A ship. A cup. A ship. A speeder. How feel you? Cold, sir. - Afraid are you? - No, sir. See through you we can. Be mindful of your feelings. Your thoughts dwell on your mother. I miss her. Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm? What has that got to do with anything? Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you. Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die? I don't know. Gungans get pasted too, eh? I hope not. Gungans no die'n without a fght. Wesa warriors. Wesa got a grand army. Dat's why you no liken us, mesa tinks. Your Highness? Your Highness... Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum... as supreme chancellor. A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption. Who else has been nominated? Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare. I feel confdent our situation will create a strong sympathy vote for us. I will be chancellor. I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator... there'll be nothing left of our people, our way of life. I understand your concern, Your Majesty. Unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I've decided to go back to Naboo. Go back? But, Your Majesty, be realistic. They'll force you to sign the treaty. I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different than that of our people. - Captain. - Your Highness. - Ready my ship. - Please, Your Majesty. Stay here where it's safe. It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate. The Force is strong with him. He is to be trained, then? No, he will not be trained. No? He is too old. He is the chosen one. You must see it. Clouded this boy's future is. I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner. An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible to take on a second. The code forbids it. - Obi-Wan is ready. - I am ready to face the trials. Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready. He is headstrong and he has much to learn of the living Force... but he is capable. There is little more he can learn from me. Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later. Now is not the time for this. The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor... and Queen Amidala is returning home... which puts pressure on the Federation and could widen the confrontation. And draw out the queen's attacker. Go with the queen to Naboo and discover the identity of this dark warrior. This is the clue we need... to unravel the mystery of the Sith. May the Force be with you. It's not disrespect, Master. It's the truth. From your point of view. The boy is dangerous. They all sense it. Why can't you? His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous. The council will decide Anakin's future. That should be enough for you. Now get on board. Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem. You won't be, Ani. I'm not allowed to train you... so I want you to watch me and be mindful. Always remember: Your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you'll be safe. Master, sir... I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians. I've been wondering... What are midi-chlorians? Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form... that resides within all living cells. - They live inside me? - Inside your cells, yes. - And we are symbionts with them. - Symbionts? Life-forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist... and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to us... telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind... you'll hear them speaking to you. I don't understand. With time and training, Ani, you will. You will. Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you. I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears that the Federation means to destroy me. I assure you I will not allow that to happen. Wesa goin' home! Come on, R2. Is the planet secure? We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life-forms. We are in complete control of the planet now. Good. I will see to it that in the senate... things stay as they are. I am sending my apprentice, Darth Maul, to join you. Yes, my lord. A Sith here? Those are the forward stabilizers. And those two control the pitch? You catch on pretty quick. As soon as we land... the Federation will arrest you and force you to sign the treaty. I agree. I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this. I will take back what's ours. There are too few of us, Your Highness. We have no army. And I can only protect you. I can't fght a war for you. Jar Jar Binks. Mesa, Your Highness? Yes. I need your help. I have one battleship on my scope. It's a droid control ship. They've probably spotted us. We haven't much time. Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master. Good. Do you think the queen's idea will work? The Gungans will not be easily swayed. And we cannot use our power to help her. I'm sorry for my behaviour, Master. It's not my place to disagree with you about the boy. And I am grateful you think I'm ready to take the trials. You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan. And you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi knight. Desa nobody dare! The Gungan city is deserted! Some kinda fght, mesa tinks. Do you think they have been taken to the camps? More likely they were wiped out. - Mesa no tink so. - Do you know where they are, Jar Jar? When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place. Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you! Your Honour, Queen Amidala of the Naboo. Heyo dadee Big Boss Nass, Your Honour. Jar Jar Binks. Who's da uss-en uthers? I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo. I come before you in peace. Ah, Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks. Yousa all bombad. We have searched you out because we wish to form an alliance. Your Honour. Whosa dis? I am Queen Amidala. This is my decoy... my protection, my loyal bodyguard. I'm sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honour... our two great societies have always lived in peace. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever. I ask you to help us. No, I beg you to help us. We are your humble servants. Our fate is in your hands. Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans? Mesa lika dis! Maybe... wesa... being friends. We've sent our patrols. We already located their starship in the swamp. It won't be long, my lord. This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggressive. Lord Maul, be mindful. Let them make the first move. Yes, my master. Deysa comin! All right! They're here! Good. They made it. Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bring uss-en and da Naboo together. Oh, no, no, no. So, wesa make you... bombad general. General? Captain. - Your Highness. - What is the situation? Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards formed an underground resistance movement. I brought back as many of the leaders as I could. The Federation army's also much larger than we thought... and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think that we can win. The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the droid army away from the cities. R2. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance... Captain Panaka will create a diversion. Then we can enter the palace and capture the viceroy. Without the viceroy, they will be lost and confused. What do you think, Master Jedi? The viceroy will be well-guarded. The diffculty is getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem. There is a possibility, with this diversion, many Gungans will be killed. Wesa ready to do our-san part. We have a plan which should immobilize the droid army. We will send what pilots we have... to knock out the droid control ship orbiting the planet. A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fghters may not penetrate the shields. There's an even bigger danger. If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness... he will return with another droid army. Well, that is why we must not fail to get the viceroy. Everything depends on it. She is more foolish than I thought. We are sending all troops... to meet this army assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. This will work to our advantage. I have your approval to proceed, then, my lord? Wipe them out. All of them. Halt! Starting up the shield. Open fre. Once we get inside, you fnd a safe place to hide and stay there. - Sure. - Stay there. Roger, roger. I thought the battle was going to take place far from here. This is too close. Ani, fnd cover. - Quick! - Get to your ships! Fighters straight ahead. Roger, Bravo Leader. Roger, Bravo Leader. Cease fre. Steady. Steady. - Activate the droids. - Yes, sir. Ouch time. Fire! My guess is the viceroy's in the throne room. Red group! Blue group! Everybody, this way! Hey, wait for me! Anakin, stay where you are. You'll be safe there. - But l... - Stay in that cockpit. - We'll handle this. - We'll take the long way. We gotta do something, R2. I'm trying to! I don't know where the trigger is! Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one. Nope. Wait. Here it is. Nope. Wait. Here it is. Yeah! Let's go! It's on automatic pilot. Try to override it. We don't have time for this, Captain. Look, there they are. That's where the autopilot's taking us. Dumb droid. Take that! Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off! The deflector shield is too strong. This is tense! R2, get us off this autopilot. It's gonna get us both killed. You did it, R2! Let's go left. Go back? Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, so that's what I'm gonna do. I'll try spinning. That's a good trick. I know we're in trouble. Just hang on. Go! Ascension guns! Retreat! Retreat! Dis is nutsen. Uh-oh. Big boomers. Give me a lift! Jar Jar, usen da booma! What? Mesa no have a booma! Here. Taken dis one. Jar Jar! Jump, Jar Jar, jump! Put down your weapons. They win this round. We're hit, R2! I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Everything's overheated. Oops. This is not good. No giben up, General Jar Jar. Mesa think of something. Hands up. My give up. My give up. Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty and end... this pointless debate in the senate. Viceroy! Your occupation here has ended. After her. This one's a decoy. Captain! Jam the doors. Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty. Yes! We have power. Shields up. Take this! And this! - Oops. - We're losing power. There seems to be a problem with the main reactor. Impossible! Nothing can get through our shield. Let's get outta here. What's that? It's blowing up from the inside! We didn't hit it. Now, this is Podracing. Look, one of ours, out of the main hold! What the... Was'n they doing? The control ship has been destroyed. Look! They all broke-ed. No, it's too late. - No. - Obi-Wan. Promise... Promise me you will train the boy. Yes, Master. He is the chosen one. He will bring balance. Train him. Now, Viceroy... you're going to have to go back to the senate and explain all this. I think you can kiss your trade franchise goodbye. We are indebted to you for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi. And you, young Skywalker. We will watch your career with great interest. Congratulations on your election, Chancellor. Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It's you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic. Confer on you the level of Jedi knight the council does. But agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner... I do not. Qui-Gon believed in him. The chosen one the boy may be. Nevertheless... grave danger I fear in his training. Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the council, if I must. Qui-Gon's defance I sense in you. Need that you do not. Agree with you the council does. Your apprentice Skywalker will be. What will happen to me now? The council have granted me permission to train you. You will be a Jedi, I promise. There's no doubt the mysterious warrior was a Sith. Always two there are. No more, no less. A master and an apprentice. But which was destroyed? The master or the apprentice? Hidoe, everybody! Peace!\n                    "}, "Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope": {"transcript": "\n\n                        1 [Alarm] Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness. [Beep Whistle Blip] [Whistle Beep Beep] We're doomed. [Beep Beep] There'll be no escape for the princess this time. [Clanking] What's that? [Beep Blip Beep] R2-D2, where are you? [Beep Blip Blip] At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel, smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute. Where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. This is a consular ship. We're on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans, and bring me the passengers! I want them alive! There's one. Set for stun. She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. Hey! You're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure. [Beep Blip] Don't you call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. [Whistle Blip Blip] Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there. I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There's no life-forms. It must have short-circuited. That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this thing is safe? [Whistle Beep Whistle] Oh. Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan. You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. Take her away! Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate. I've traced the rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. She'll die before she'll tell you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed. Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship, and no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life-forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them- See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir. How did we get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. [Blip Whistle] I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is! [Bleep Blip] Where do you think you're going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? [Beep Blip] Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? [Beep Beep] I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. [Beep Whistle] [Blip Bleep Blip] No more adventures. I'm not going that way. That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault. He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait! What's that? A transport. I'm saved! Over here! Hey! Help! Please help! [Whistle Whistle] [Beep Blip Blip Beep] [Speaking Alien Language] [Beep Whistle Blip] [Whistle Blip Blip] R2? [Blip Blip] R2-D2, it is you! It is you! [Whistle Whistle] Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir, droids. We stopped. Wake up! Wake up! [Beep Blip Beep Beep] We're doomed. [Speaking Alien Language] Do you think they'll melt us down? [Beep Blip] Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? [Speaking Alien Language] All right, fine. Let's go. Luke! Luke! Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce. Doesn't look like we have much of a choice, but I'll remind him. [Speaking Alien Language] Yeah, we'll take that red one. No, not that one. [Speaking Alien Language] I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol. Protocol? Why, it's my primary function, sir. I am well-versed in all the customs- I have no need for a protocol droid. Of course you haven't, sir. Not in an environment such as this. That is why I have been programmed- What I really need is a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators? Sir, my firstjob was programming binary load lifters, very similar to your vaporators in most respects. Can you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language to me- Yeah, all right. Shut up. I'll take this one. Luke! Take these two over to the garage, will you? I want them cleaned up before dinner. But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters. You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on. Get to it. All right. Come on. [Whining] And the red one. Come on. [Beep Beep] Well, come on, red. Let's go. [Beep Whistle] Uncle Owen! Yeah? This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look. Hey, what are you trying to push on us? [Bleep Bleep Bleep] Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain. Uncle Owen, what about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that one. Take this away. You'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. [Beep Blip] O.K. Let's go. Now, don't you forget this. Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity. [Whistle] Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move. Itjust isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here. Is there anything I might do to help? No. Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock. I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things, not on this planet, anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on. Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. I see, sir. You can call me Luke. I see, Sir Luke. Ha ha. Just Luke. Oh... And I am C-3 PO, human-cyborg relations. This is my counterpart... R2-D2. Hello. [Beep Beep Blip] You got a lot of carbon scoring. Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the rebellion and all. You know of the rebellion against the Empire?! That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir. Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyway. Well, my little friend, you got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a Starcruiser or- Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? \"What is what\"? He asked you a question. What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. [Beep Blip Blip] He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, I believe. Our captain was attached- Is there any more to this recording? [Whistle Blip Beep] Behave yourself, R2. You're going to get us into trouble. It's all right. You can trust him. He's our new master. [Beep Blip Beep] He says that he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts, and it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles. But with all we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi. I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi. I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? I don't know any Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. I wonder who she is. Sounds like she's in trouble. I better play back the whole thing. [Beep! Beep!] He says the restraining bolt has short-circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. Oh, yeah. Well... I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off. O. K... There you go. Wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back. Play back the entire message. \"What message\"? The one you've just been playing! The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards. Luke! Luke! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Here. See what you can do with him. I'll be right back. [Beep Blip] Just you reconsider playing that message for him. [Beep Beep] No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you, either. [Beep Beep] You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Mm-mm. I wonder if he's related to Ben. That wizard's just a crazy old man. Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't. I don't think he exists anymore. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow. In the morning, I want them up there on the south ridge working on those condensers. Yes, sir. I think those new droids are gonna work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about me staying on another season? And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the academy this year. You mean the next semester before the harvest? Sure. There's more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. It's only one season more. This year we'll make enough on the harvest that I'll be able to hire more hands and then you can go to the academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year! Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? Looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to go finish cleaning those droids. Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of. Ooh! What are you doing hiding back there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. Kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no. That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Uncle Owen: Luke! I'm shutting the power down. All right! I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. That little droid's going to cause me a lotta trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir. Come on. Luke? Luke! Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he better have those units in the south range repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay. Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner. Dead ahead. It might be our little R2 unit. Hit the accelerator! [Speaking Alien Language] Hey, whoa! Where do you think you're going? [Beep Beep Beep] Master Luke is your rightful owner now. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish. [Beep] And don't talk to me of your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here! No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go. [Whistle Whistle] What's wrong with him now? There are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople, or worse. Come on. Let's go have a look. Come on! Well, there are two banthas down there, but I don't see any... Wait a second. They're Sandpeople, all right. I can see one of them now. [Beep Whistle] [Beep Beep] [Howl] Hello, there. [Beep Blip] Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid. [Beep Blip Blip] Oh, don't worry. He'll be all right. Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day. You're fortunate to be all in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi? Boy, am I glad to see you. The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly. [Beep Beep] Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far? This little droid. [Blip Blip] I think he's searching for his former master, but I've never seen such devotion in a droid before. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about? Obi-Wan Kenobi? Obi-Wan. Now, that's a name I've not heard in a long time. A long time. I think my uncle knows him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead. Not yet. You know him? Well, of course I know him. He's me. [Beep Beep] I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since, oh, before you were born. Well, then the droid does belong to you. I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting. [Growling] I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled, but they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers. [Beep] 3 PO. Where am I? I must have taken a bad step. Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly. They're on the move. No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me, I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for a while. Sure. Go ahead. What is it? It's your father's lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic, before the dark times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force? The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together. [Beep Blip Blip Beep] Now let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend, and where you come from. I saw part of a message he was... I seem to have found it. General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person. But my ship has fallen under attack, and I am afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to get home. It's late. I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's all such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. My uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course. Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station. The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate- The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible. How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line- fear of this battle station. And what of the rebellion? If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion hasn't helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortre- I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this. Vader, release him. As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke. It looks like the Sandpeople did this, all right. Look. There's gaffi sticks, bantha tracks. It's just, I've never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't, but we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side-by-side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO. And these blast points, too accurate... for Sandpeople. Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise. But why would imperial troops want to slaughterJawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to, and that would lead them back... home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous! Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen! And now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base. There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. [Chattering] [Braying] How long have you had these droids? Three or four seasons. They're up for sale if you want them. Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These aren't the droids you're looking for. These aren't the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. I can't abide those Jawas. Disgusting creatures! Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. Do you really think we're gonna find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here, only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, R2. [Alien Lounge Music Plays] [Laughter] Hey! We don't serve their kind here. What? Your droids, they'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Why don't you wait out by the speeder? We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you, sir. Uh... I'll have one of those. [Speaking Alien Language] He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you, either. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on 12 systems. I'll be careful. You'll be dead! This little one's not worth the effort. Come, let me get you something. Aah! I'm all right. Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs. I've outrun imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers... myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it, some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements. Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? And it's gonna cost you something extra. 10,000, all in advance. 10,000? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's gonna fly it, kid, you? You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself. We don't have to sit here and listen- We can pay you 2,000 now plus 15 when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen, huh? O.K. You guys got yourselves a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking Bay 94. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. All right. We'll check it out. 17,000! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship, get it ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's O.K. I'm never coming back to this planet again. [Speaking Huttese] Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. [Speaking Huttese] It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head so large... every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I've got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba- Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers... who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess. Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final checkout is completed. All systems are operational. What course shall we set? Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan. With pleasure. Lock the door, R2. Check this side of the street. The door's locked. Move on to the next. I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. [Beep Beep] You watch your language. All right. Give it to me. I'll take it. Look at this. Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand. It'll be enough. [Speaking Huttese] Solo! Come out of there, Solo! Right here, Jabba. I've been waitin' for you. [Speaking Huttese] Have you now. You didn't think I was gonna run, did you? [Speaking Huttese] Han, my boy, you disappoint me. Why haven't you paid me... and why did you fry poor Greedo? Look, Jabba, next time you want to talk to me, come see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps. Han, I can't make exceptions. What if everyone who smuggled for me... dropped their cargo at the first sign... of an imperial starship? It's not good business. Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes. You think I had a choice? But I got a nice, easy charter. I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time. Han, my boy, you're the best. So, for an extra 20- Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it. Okay, 15%. But if you fail me again... I'll put a price on your head so big... you won't be able to go near a civilized system. Jabba... you're a wonderful human being. Come on! If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well. [Speaking Alien Language] What a piece of junk! She'll make.5 past light speed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board, we'll get outta here. Hello, sir. Which way? [Speaking Alien Language] All right, men, load your weapons. Stop that ship! Blast them! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel. [Grrr] Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold 'em off. Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in. They're gonna try and cut us off. Why don't you outrun 'em? I thought you said this thing was fast! Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em. Here's where the fun begins. How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining? Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy! Without precise calculations, we'd fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova, and that would end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm gonna make the jump to light speed. We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin. I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Princess Leia, before your execution... I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet ofAlderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system. I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time. Where is the rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. There. You see, Lord Vader? She can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration, but don't worry. We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition. Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun them. Don't everybody thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours. Now be careful, R2. Argh! He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. Grrr... I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2. Let the Wookiee win. Argh! Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. [Han Solo Laughs] Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self... and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Stretch out with your feelings. You see? You can do it. Han: I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else. [Beeping] Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world. Yes? Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied. She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion. Terminate her immediately. Stand by, Chewie. Here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the Arrghh arrgh! We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position's correct, except no Alderaan. What do you mean? Where is it? That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed by the Empire. The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It would take 1,000 ships with more firepower than- [Beep] There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short-range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie, jam its transmissions. It would be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long. A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something. Well, he ain't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us. Look at him. He's heading for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there. He's almost in range. That's no moon. It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Turn the ship around. Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power! Why are we still moving towards it?! We're caught in a tractor beam. It's pulling us in! There's got to be something you can do! There's nothing I can do about it, kid. I'm at full power. I'm gonna have to shut down. They're not gonna get me without a fight. You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting. Clear Bay 327. We are opening the magnetic field. To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields. Yes? [Beep] We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. Its markings match those ofa ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9. Release charge. 316, report to control. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned. Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew aboard. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something, a presence I've not felt since- Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked. There's no one here. Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. Leave that to me. Damn fool, I knew that you were gonna say that. Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? Argh! The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. [Thud] Han: Hey, down there! Could you give us a hand with this? [Zap Zap] TK-421, why aren't you at your post? TK-421, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. Grrr! Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneakin' around. We've found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network. [Beep Blip] [Blip Bleep Whistle] He says he's found the main controls to the power beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already. I want to go with you. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. They must be delivered safely, or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path from mine. The Force will be with you always. Argh argh argh! You said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas. Well, anything's better than just hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up. Who do you think... [Beep Beep] What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \"I've found her\" and keeps repeating \"She's here.\" Well, who... who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here?! Princess? Where? Where is she? Princess? What's going on? [Beep Blip] [Bleep Blip Beep] Level 5, Detention Block AA-23. [Beep Beep Blip] I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something! What are you talking about? The droids belong to her. She's the one in the message. We got to help her. Now look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Just find a way back into that detention block. I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago, you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay? Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're gonna kill her! Better her than me. She's rich. Argh! Rich? Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well, more well than you can imagine. I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit. You'll get it. I better. You will. All right, kid. You better be right about this. All right. What's your plan? Um... 3 PO, hand me those binders there, will you? O.K. Now... I'm gonna put these on you. Grrr! O.K. Han, you... you put those on. Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here? Lock the door. And hope they don't have blasters. That isn't very reassuring. [Beep Whistle] Grrr! 517 to scanner control. 316, report to control. 53 to upper bay door. Luke: I can't see a thing in this helmet. Han: This is not gonna work. Luke: Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before. Where are you taking this... thing? Luke: Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Argh! Han: Look out! He's loose! Luke: He'll tear us all apart! I'll get him! Look out! Arrgh! [Beep Beep Beep] Han: We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is2187. You go and get her. I'll hold them here. [Beep Beep Beep] Uh... Uh, everything's under control. Situation normal. What happened? Had a slight weapons malfunction, but, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fineWe're all fine here now. Thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, negative, negative! We have aa reactor leak here, uh, now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Uh, large leak, very dangerous. Who is this? What's your operating number? Uh... Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're gonna have company! Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper? Huh? Oh, the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi?! Where is he? Come on! He is here. Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the Force. The Jedi are extinct. Their fire has gone out of the universe. [Beep] You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes. We have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23. The princess? Put all sections on alert. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone. Argh! Get behind me! Get behind me! Watch your left. They went down the cell bay. Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. C-3PO, C-3PO! Yes, sir? Are there any other ways out of the cell bay? We've been cut off! What was that? I didn't copy. I said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out. All other information on your level is restricted. Stormtrooper: Open up in there! Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out! Argh! I can't hold them off forever! Now what?! This is some rescue! You came in here, and you didn't have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart! Well, I didn't- What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, flyboy. Get in there! Arrgh! Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell. Get in there, and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her, or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there! Aah! Ah! Argh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here. Get away from there. No, wait! Will you forget it?! I already tried it! It's magnetically sealed. Put that thing away! You're gonna get us all killed! Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here! Ya know, it's not gonna take 'em long to figure out what happened to us! It could be worse. Woorr! It's worse. There's something alive in here. That's your imagination. Something just moved past my leg. Look! Did you see that? What? Grrr! Woorr! Kid! Luke! Leia: Aah! Woorr! Luke! Luke, grab hold of this! Blast it! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Luke, Luke! [Clanking] Help him! What happened? I don't know. Itjust let go of me and disappeared. I got a bad feeling about this. Grrr! [Clanking] The walls are moving! Don't just stand there! Try and brace it with something. Grrr! Help me! Wait a minute! 3PO! Come in, 3PO! 3PO! Where could he be? Take over. See to him. Look, there. They're madmen. They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me. You stand guard. Come on. [Whistle Blip Beep] Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right. 3PO! Come in, 3PO! 3PO! Get on top! I can't. Where could he be?! 3PO! 3 PO, will you come in! They aren't here. Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry. [Whistle Blip Beep] One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner. Get on top of it. I'm trying. Thank goodness they haven't found them. Where could they be? [Whistle Blip Beep] \"Use the comlink\"? Oh, my. I forgot. I turned it off. Are you there, sir? 3PO! We've had some problems. Will you shut up and listen to me?! Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will ya?! Do you copy!? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level! No! Shut them all down. Hurry! [Bleep Bleep Whistle] [Beep Blip Blip] What? Ha ha! [Screaming] Listen to them. They're dying, R2! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master. We're all right! You did great! Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... Where are we? 3263827! If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get outta here. Well, let's get moving. Grrr! Where are you going? Aw... No, wait! They'll hear! Come here, you big coward. Chewie, come here. Listen... I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you, O. K? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one personme. It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this. Give me regular reports, please. Right. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. You seen that new VT-16? Yeah. Some of the other guys were telling me about it. They say it's... it's quite a thing to see- What was that? Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing. Don't worry about it. There she is. C-3PO? Do you copy? Yes, sir. Are you safe? For the moment. We're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Nice! Come on. It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on. Aah! Whoop! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock. That oughta hold them for a while. Quick! We've got to get across. Find the controls that extend the bridge. I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come. For luck. We think they may be splitting up. They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir. Where could they be? [Whistle Blip Beep] Close the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner. Now / am the master. Only a master of evil, Darth. Your powers are weak, old man. You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. You should not have come back. Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We, uh, ran into some old friends. The ship all right? It seems O.K., if we can get to it. I just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, R2, we're going. [Beep Beep] Now's our chance! Go! Ben? No! Come on! Luke, it's too late! Blast the door, kid! Obi-Wan... Run, Luke, run! I hope that old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. O.K. Hit it! Aargh! We're coming up on their sentry ships. Hold them off. Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns. I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet. You in, kid? O.K., stay sharp. Here they come. They're coming in too fast! We've lost the lateral controls! Don't worry. She'll hold together. Hear me, baby? Hold together. Ha ha! Got him! I got him! Great, kid! Don't get cocky. There's still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault! [Whistle Bleep Blip] Are they away? They've just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself. That doesn't sound too hard. They let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy? You call that easy? They're tracking us. Not this ship, sister. At least the information in R2 is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet. It is for me, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive. Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody. I care. So... what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid. Good. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know. What do you think? You think a princess and a guy like me- No! You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst. We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack. It's our only hope. [Beep] Yes. We're approaching the planet Yavin. The rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet. The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pilot: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. The approach will not be easy. You're required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only 2 meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home. They're not much bigger than 2 meters. Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you. Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the rebel base will be in range in 30 minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi... and will soon see the end of the rebellion. All flight crews, man your stations. So... you got your reward and you're just leaving, then? That's right. Yeah. I got some old debts I got to pay off with this stuff. And even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya. Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them. What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide. All right. Take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you. Argh! What are you looking at? I know what I'm doing. All pilots to your stations. What's wrong? Oh, it's Han. I don't know. I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. Open main launch tubes. Main launch tubes opening, sir. Hey, Luke! Biggs! I don't believe it. How are you? Great. Hey, coming up? I'll be right up there with you, and have I got stories to tell you. Are you sure you can handle this ship? Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories. You'll do all right. Thank you, sir. I'll try. I gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right? All right. Hey, Biggs. I told you I'd make it someday. It'll be like old times, Luke. They'll never stop us. Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up. You want a new one? Not on your life. That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You O.K., R2? [Blip Beep] Good. Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure. Hang on tight, R2. You've got to come back. [Beep Blip Beep] You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? [Beep Beep Beep] Obi-Wan: Luke, the Force will be with you. Standby alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, 15 minutes. All wings report in. Red 10 standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red 11 standing by. Red Five standing by. [Beep Beep] Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through the magnetic field. Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on. Double front. Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys. Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five. I'm going in. Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K. We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small, they're evading our turbolasers. We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins. I'm right with you, Red Three. I've got a problem here. Eject. I can hold it. Pull up! No, I'm allAah! The rebel base will be in firing range in seven minutes. Obi-Wan: Luke, trust your feelings. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way. My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Pick up your visual scanning. Here they come. Watch it. You've got one on your tail. I'm hit! You've picked one up! Watch it! I can't see it! He's on me tight. I can't shake him! I'll be right there. Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me. Fall in! Fall in! Watch your back, Luke. Watch your back. Fighters above you, coming in. I'm hit, but not bad. R2, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six, can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke. Hold on. Blast it, Biggs! Where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge. Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. We're starting our attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation. The exhaust port is marked and locked in. Switch all power to front deflector screen. How many guns do you think, Gold Five? Say about 20 guns some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switch to targeting computer. Computer locked. Getting a signal. The guns! They've stopped! Stabilize your rear deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters. They're coming in! Three marks at 210. I'll take them myself. Cover me. Yes, sir. It's no good. I can't maneuver. Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target. Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader, lost Tiree, lost Hutch. I copy, Gold Leader. They came from behind. We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate in our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances. Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red boys, this is Red Leader. Rendezvous at mark 6.1. This is Red Two flying toward you. Red Three standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters. There's too much interference. Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any Wait. Coming in.35. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up. Just hold them off for a few seconds. Close up formation. Almost there. You'd better let her loose. They're right behind me. Almost there. I can't hold them. Aah! It's away! It's a hit! Negative, negative. It didn't go in. Itjust impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to.05. We'll cover for you. Stay there. I just lost my starboard engine. Get set up for your attack run. Aah! Rebel base, one minute and closing. Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in full throttle. That ought to keep those fighters off our back. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed, will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggars Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port. Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself. Increase speed, full throttle. What about that tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again. See if you can't lock it down. [Beep Blip Beep] Fighters coming in.3. I'm hit! I can't stay with you! Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there. Sorry. Let him go. Stay on the leader. Hurry, Luke. They're coming in much faster this time. We can't hold them. R2, try and increase the power. [Beep Beep Beep] Hurry up, Luke! Quick! Quick! Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing. I'm on the leader. Hang on, R2. Obi-Wan: Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one. Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer! What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. [Beep Blip Beep] [Eeeeee] I've lost R2! The Death Star has cleared the planet. Rebel base in range. You may fire when ready. Commence primary ignition. I have you now. What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid! Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by. Great shot, kid! That was one in a million! Obi-Wan: Remember, the Force will be with you always. [Cheering] Luke! Hey! Hey! I knew you'd come back. I just knew it. Well, I wasn't going to let you get all the credit and take all the reward. Hey, I knew there was more to you than money. Oh, no! Oh, my. R2, can you hear me? Say something. You can repair him, can't you? We'll get to work on him right away. You must repair him. Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them. He'll be all right.

I, I\r couldn't possibly get away!\r  Not to worry, Minister. Lord Vader\r and I will manage in your absence.\r  You and your crew have proven invaluable\r to our fleet, Captain Syndulla.\r  The fuel acquired\r in your convoy attacks\r  has helped keep us one step\r ahead of Imperial patrols.\r  Thank you, Commander Sato.\r  I'm just sorry our intel\r about shield generators\r  being on that\r shipment was wrong.\r  Perhaps with\r your next attack, Hera.\r  What is the meaning of this?\r  An incoming transmission.\r Who from, Chop?\r  Ah, why don't you just play it?\r  Uh, Chop, cloak us\r with a one-way transmission.\r  Hey, it's Old Jho!\r  I can't see you, but I can\r hear you, my friends.\r  Time is short, and there's someone\r here desperate to speak with you.\r  I told her I couldn't find you,\r  but she wouldn't take no\r for an answer.\r  She says she needs your help.\r  We're always ready to\r help someone in need.\r  Yeah, well, this one's different.\r  Minister Tua?\r  Aw, we can't trust her.\r She's an Imperial.\r  Please, I beg you.\r Listen to my request.\r  End transmission now, Chop.\r  Wait! Minister,\r what do you want?\r  My life is in danger.\r  I need you to give me\r safe passage off Lothal.\r  - You're not really considering this?\r - Quiet!\r  I assure you, my intentions \r are sincere.\r  To prove it, I will trade\r secret Imperial information.\r  You're defecting\r from the Empire?\r  Yes, I am.\r  She's telling the truth.\r  I can sense her fear.\r  Yeah, but of what?\r  - So what have you got to trade?\r - A list\r  Of rebel sympathizers\r on Lothal\r  And other nearby systems.\r  How come these sympathizers\r have not been arrested?\r  Some have powerful friends\r in the Senate.\r  Imperial command watches them,\r but can do nothing.\r  I know you need allies.\r  Get me off Lothal,\r and I will give you the list.\r  We shouldn't even consider this.\r  It's obviously a trap.\r  There's something else.\r  I've discovered the true reason\r the Empire came to Lothal.\r  We know that one.\r  The Empire has a factory,\r  and they're stripping the\r planet's resources to fuel it.\r  No. There is another reason\r known only to a few\r  and ordered\r by the Emperor himself.\r  We have to do this.\r  - I agree.\r - So do I.\r  All right, if Commander Sato\r approves the mission.\r  I believe it could be\r worth the risk.\r  Minister, we'll get you out.\r Send us your coordinates.\r  Thank you.\r  Well, I guess we're on our way\r back to Lothal.\r  I guess we are.\r  Hey! What's with you?\r  Do you have any idea\r how inappropriate that was?\r  Actually, no, I don't.\r  You can't just tell Chopper\r  to project a hologram in a secret\r debriefing without authorization.\r  Authorization! Procedure!\r That's what's bothering me.\r  All right, talk to me.\r  After this mission, I want\r us to go back on our own.\r  Fighting alongside soldiers\r isn't what I signed up for.\r  You seem to be forgetting these\r soldiers helped save your life.\r  And I'm grateful. But that doesn't\r mean I want to join their little army.\r  When you and I started together,\r  it was, \"Rob from the Empire,\r give to the needy.\"\r  A noble cause.\r  Now we're getting drawn into some kind\r of military thing. I don't like it.\r  We are fighting a bigger fight,\r but it's still the right fight.\r  I survived one war.\r I'm not ready for another one.\r  - I saw what it did.\r - To the Jedi?\r  To everyone.\r  So, we're not taking the Ghost,\r and we're letting Chopper drive?\r  After our stunt on Mustafar,\r  there's a good chance the Empire\r will be able to track it.\r  Great mission so far.\r  So what's the plan?\r  Okay, so Minister Tua is scheduled\r to visit Governor Tarkin tomorrow.\r  She leaves Lothal\r via shuttle at 1800.\r  We wait at the hangar, steal the\r shuttle and take her to safety.\r  Ezra, I hope you're\r sure about this.\r  After all the trouble she's made\r for us, why should we help her?\r  Because that's what we do. Help\r those who can't help themselves.\r  Plus, her list will help us out.\r  Shuttle 593,\r  this is Lothal Control.\r You are cleared to land.\r  I didn't think\r I'd miss it, but I\r  What is it?\r  Do you feel that?\r I I feel so cold.\r  Hmm.\r  I've never seen so many\r Star Destroyers here.\r  It's gotten worse.\r  All right, Zeb, Chopper, stay with the\r shuttle in case we need a quick exit.\r  Tua's leaving\r from Bay 23. Let's go.\r  Huh. We'll need a distraction.\r  Well, I'm gonna go\r make a few friends.\r  When Tua arrives, I'll keep 'em busy while\r you drop into the hangar from above.\r  - Make a few friends?\r - It'll be fun.\r  - Fun?\r - Don't worry, General Hera.\r  Just be ready to move.\r  Hey, didn't we meet in basic training?\r You look familiar.\r  - Kanan's gone bucket head.\r - I don't believe it.\r  I'm kinda jealous.\r I only have the helmet.\r  Here she comes.\r  But she's got company.\r  What kind of company?\r  Oh, fantastic. Agent Kallus.\r  Thank you, Agent Kallus,\r but there,\r  there was no need for an escort.\r  Lord Vader asked me to make sure\r you reached your shuttle safely.\r  I see.\r  We can't be too careful\r about security these days.\r  Yes, I suppose so.\r  Hey!\r  Minister, take cover!\r  Surprise.\r  Rebels!\r  Minister, get to the shuttle!\r  - We'll be right behind you.\r - Right.\r  Minister Tua.\r  You did this!\r  - Zeb, we need a pickup. Now!\r - Copy. We're on our way.\r  Come on!\r  Come on. Come on! Up, everybody!\r We're moving!\r  Everything has happened\r as you predicted, Lord Vader.\r  Now inform the populace the rebel\r assassins hide in their midst.\r  Lock down the spaceport\r  and make it known any ship attempting\r to leave will be destroyed.\r  Right away.\r  A beloved citizen of Lothal,\r  Minister Tua's life was cut short\r by this criminal band of rebels.\r  If you see them, summon Imperial\r authorities immediately.\r  Trooper corps have been mobilized\r in an extensive sea\r  They did this to\r turn Lothal against us.\r  We can't do any more here.\r We have to leave, for good.\r  We can't just run.\r  The people have to\r know the truth.\r  I don't think the Empire\r is giving us much choice.\r  What the\r  Open up in there!\r  We're in trouble!\r  They resealed the door.\r  Blast it open.\r  Hold your fire.\r Hold your fire!\r  If they know about this hideout,\r they'll know about our others.\r  - There's no more hiding.\r - We need a ship.\r  Maybe we can try one of the\r local Imperial airfields.\r  They're locked down. Besides, we'll\r never get outside the capital.\r  The Empire's looking\r everywhere for us.\r  Not everywhere.\r  The Imperial Complex?\r Are you crazy?\r  Does anyone ever say yes\r to that question?\r  He's right.\r  Deploying troops to block every city\r exit has spread the garrison thin.\r  It sounds crazy, but the area\r with the least troops will be\r  here, near the factories.\r  There are landing platforms\r outside these hangars.\r  They're our best chance if\r we're gonna find a shuttle.\r  I'm already dressed\r for the part.\r  I guess there is no going home.\r  What's this?\r  Power cells in need of recharging\r for the rebel pursuit.\r  Hold it right there, Cadet.\r We have to check inside.\r  I got this.\r  No, you don't have\r to check inside.\r  Did you just try to give me\r an order, Cadet?\r  No. He just said, \"You don't\r have to check inside.\"\r  I don't have to check inside.\r  Well, then,\r as you wish, Trooper.\r  Cadet, let's move.\r Hurry it up!\r  I wish that worked for me.\r  I wish it worked on you.\r  Zeb, will you be quiet?\r  What? I need to breathe.\r Have you smelled me?\r  Huh. Don't think it\r matters if you're noisy.\r  There's nobody around.\r This was a good plan.\r  Of course it was a good plan.\r We came up with it.\r  This way.\r  Somebody get Chopper.\r  - You think we'll find them this time?\r - We better.\r  Found me.\r  There's a shuttle.\r What'd I tell ya?\r  You did good.\r  Hera, over here.\r  - Shield generators.\r - Military grade.\r  Zeb, Ezra,\r grab all we can carry.\r  These might help\r turn this day around.\r  The fleet could sure use them.\r  Do you feel that?\r  The cold.\r  Hera, go!\r We'll cover you!\r  Kanan, look out!\r  Your master has deceived you into\r believing you can become a Jedi.\r  Get ready to fly us outta here!\r  You know what I do\r in hopeless situations?\r  Yeah.\r Blow stuff up.\r  Aim for the walkers.\r  Now!\r  If that doesn't kill him,\r what will?\r  Not us. Run!\r  Go, Chop! Come on! Come on!\r  Ah!\r  My lord, I will mobilize\r our fighters to pursue.\r  That will be\r unnecessary, Commander.\r  The rebels will not leave\r the planet yet.\r  Zeb, make sure\r they can't track us.\r  Consider it done.\r  You all right?\r  Yeah, I'll live.\r  Kanan, what was that?\r  - Another Inquisitor?\r - No.\r  Something worse.\r  What?\r  A Sith Lord.\r The ancient enemy of the Jedi.\r  How do we fight him?\r  Fight him? Ezra,\r we were lucky to survive.\r  Then that settles it. I'm going to\r make for orbit so we can jump away.\r  Hera, no.\r  He will have a blockade of\r Destroyers waiting for us.\r  And this shuttle is slow, with\r barely any weapons or shields.\r  We're gonna have to smuggle\r ourselves off Lothal for a change.\r  Mmm, that's not a bad idea.\r  What are you thinkin'?\r  I'm thinking we know the right\r man to smuggle us off-world.\r  Not him!\r  My lord, our scans have indicated\r that the stolen shuttle\r  has not attempted\r to leave the system.\r  Fear has driven them to ground.\r  There is a refugee camp the rebels\r have provided aid to in the past.\r  Yes, \"Tarkintown\" they call it.\r  You suspect the rebels\r are in hiding there?\r  No, but I want you to burn it.\r  The compassion of the rebels\r is a weakness.\r  One we will exploit.\r  Yes, my lord.\r  Well, hello there,\r Captain Syndulla.\r  This is a pleasant surprise.\r What can I do for you?\r  This isn't a social call, Lando.\r It's business.\r  We need your help to smuggle\r something off Lothal.\r  Past the Imperial blockade.\r  You know, if the Empire learns I got\r involved, it'd be all over for me.\r  I'd be taking an awful big risk.\r  What do you want?\r  What have you got?\r  Imperial shield generators.\r Military grade.\r  Ooh. Now that's merchandise I can move.\r How many we talking about?\r  Two.\r  Two?\r  You are no gambler, Hera.\r  Offering me two means\r you've got at least six,\r  so I think,\r three is probably fair.\r  Fair? You're taking half.\r  Those shields won't do you\r much good if you're dead.\r  Three it is.\r So we have a deal?\r  While I'm not on Lothal at\r the moment, my droid is.\r  Go to my operation, and he'll set\r you up with everything you need.\r  You must be Lando's droid.\r  Yes, ma'am. Welcome.\r  I have prepared everything according\r to Calrissian's instructions.\r  Is one of you a mechanic?\r  Oh, that must be me.\r  Definitely not you.\r  - Hey, kid!\r - Just let him go, Zeb.\r  There's no one.\r They're all gone.\r  They're prisoners\r of the Empire now.\r  All I sense is evil.\r  Why would they burn Tarkintown?\r  To spread fear, make us afraid.\r  The people that lived here\r just got caught in the middle.\r  This happened because of us?\r  There's a cost for any\r action we take now, Ezra.\r  Things are getting worse just as\r they did back when I was your age.\r  But back then,\r  there were 10,000 Jedi Knights\r protecting the galaxy.\r  Now\r  There's just you and me.\r  Against an Empire.\r  We can fight!\r We have allies.\r  Do you understand\r what you're saying?\r  You saw what we're up against.\r  - Look!\r - I'm not afraid.\r  That's what worries me.\r  What happened out there?\r  The Empire burned Tarkintown.\r  Did anyone survive?\r  The population's\r been taken captive.\r  Let's go bust 'em out.\r  - Where's my rifle?\r - No. He'd be waiting.\r  You were right. We have no choice.\r We have to leave.\r  For the good of Lothal.\r  So what's the plan\r for gettin' out of here?\r  Lando had these old\r transponders lying around.\r  Sabine's gonna tune their signature\r codes to match this shuttle's.\r  Sounds like a lousy Lando plan.\r  No, it's Lando's gear.\r It was my plan.\r  With these transponders beaming out\r the same signal as the shuttle,\r  we should be able\r to slip by unnoticed.\r  Ooh, sounds like\r a lousy Sabine plan.\r  Better than Lando's.\r  Admiral, I'm scanning a ship\r leaving the surface in Sector 4.\r  Its transponder codes match those\r of the stolen Imperial shuttle.\r  Order all fighters to intercept.\r  Sir, I'm scanning the same\r transponder in Sector 9.\r  There must be a mistake.\r  Re-scan.\r  I'm tracking the identical\r signal in Sector 11 and Sector 5.\r  The Empire's takin' the bait.\r  Their fighters are splittin' up.\r  All right.\r Let's make our run.\r  We have a TIE reporting in.\r  It appears to be some kind of\r device sending out a signal.\r  Delta Squadron\r is reporting another device.\r  Order our pilots to destroy them. The\r rebels are trying to mask their escape.\r  Sir, one of the transponders\r is moving into orbit.\r  It's breaking out.\r  All ships converge\r on that signal.\r  Looks like they figured it out.\r  It's too late, boys.\r  The signal is gone.\r They've jumped.\r  Never thought I'd say this, but\r thank you, Lando Calrissian.\r  So if we can't go back to\r Lothal, where are we going?\r  What are you talking about? We're\r part of the rebellion now.\r  Are we? Are we all\r sure about that?\r  Maybe we could just grab the\r Ghost and lay low for a while.\r  I like fighting\r with Phoenix Squadron.\r  Reminds me of the Honor Guard.\r  Besides, they're counting on us.\r  Wouldn't be right\r to abandon them now.\r  Ezra, what do you think?\r  We can't help Lothal now,\r  but I think the rebels\r can help us get stronger,\r  so we can go back\r and change things.\r  I think we should\r stay with the rebel fleet.\r  My lord, I regret to inform you\r  that the rebels have\r escaped Lothal.\r  Have my ship prepared.\r  Agent Kallus,\r I don't think I understand.\r  There is a tracking device\r hidden aboard that shuttle.\r  Now ready the fleet to deploy.\r  Phoenix Home,\r this is  Ghost  away team.\r  Clearance code\r 1-2-1-8-1-5.\r  Your clearance code\r checks out. Welcome home, Ghost  team.\r  Chopper said a transmitter activated\r on our shuttle moments ago.\r  What does that mean?\r  It means the Empire\r tracked us back to the fleet.\r  Commander Sato!\r  We need the fleet to jump out of here.\r Our shuttle was tracked.\r  Commander, I'm scanning\r a ship entering our sector.\r  We're tracking one target. No other\r ships have entered the system.\r  Move Phoenix Squadron\r to intercept.\r  Fighter coming in at mark 3.\r  He's coming in too fast!\r  Fleet, raise deflector shields.\r  We've lost\r Phoenix 1  and  2.\r  He's heading right for us.\r  Enemy fighter's\r making for the command ship.\r  How can one fighter\r best our entire squadron?\r  Your pilots are outmatched,\r Commander.\r  Uh, what are you doing?\r  Getting involved.\r  Not without me, you're not.\r  Let's go.\r  Ezra, come on!\r  All right if I tag along?\r  The more, the merrier.\r  Everyone, check in.\r  - Tail gun, check!\r - Turret, check!\r  Nose gun, check!\r Check!\r  - All right, kids, do Mom and Dad proud.\r - Here he comes.\r  We've lost\r our shields!\r  Ghost  moving to engage.\r  I'm on him!\r  Who is this guy?\r  Sir, the last attack\r damaged the hyperdrive core!\r  We are dead in space.\r  Phoenix Home to  Ghost.\r  We can't withstand another\r attack from that fighter.\r  Copy that. Phoenix Squadron,\r form up and focus fire.\r  The Force is strong with him.\r  Kanan, let's find out how strong.\r  - How can I help?\r - Just remember your training.\r  Enemy ship closing\r to attack range.\r  There's something familiar.\r  I feel Cold.\r  I think I know who it is.\r  Back on Lothal I felt something.\r Kanan did too.\r  The fear. The anger. The hate.\r  It's the Sith Lord we faced.\r  The apprentice lives.\r  Ahsoka?\r  The Imperial pilot broke off his attack!\r They did it!\r  Captain Syndulla, whatever\r you're doing, keep it up!\r  - The fleet can recover!\r - No!\r  Commander, you need to get\r the fleet out of here now!\r  I will not abandon\r our command ship.\r  You don't have a choice, sir. Without\r a hyperdrive, you must abandon ship.\r  Sir, we have Star\r Destroyers in Sector 5.\r  Lord Vader, we have entered the\r system and await your orders.\r  Move your Destroyers to block\r their escape, but hold your fire.\r  I want these rebels alive.\r  It's now or never, Commander.\r  I regretfully agree.\r All hands, abandon ship.\r  You'll have to keep\r that fighter occupied.\r  Don't worry, sir. We seem\r to have his attention.\r  Suddenly, there's\r a lot to do back here.\r  Sorry to spoil your fun, Zeb,\r  but I'm ordering Chopper to divert\r all power to the hyperdrive,\r  including cannons.\r  Hera, what are you doing?\r  I think I know.\r  Admiral, Lord Vader has separated\r one of the rebel ships\r  from the rest of the fleet.\r  Then that is our primary target.\r  Ghost  crew,\r the escape pods are secure.\r  Fleet, commence hyperspace jump.\r  Copy that, Commander.\r We'll meet you at safe haven.\r  The fleet is away.\r Get us out of here!\r  Everyone, hang on.\r  Chopper, angle\r all deflectors astern.\r  The Star Destroyers aren't\r the ones firing at us!\r  Now, do it fast!\r  Target moving into range.\r  Activate tractor beam\r on my signal.\r  Hera!\r  Wait.\r  Wait\r  - Now.\r - Gotcha.\r  Status report on\r the rebel craft.\r  Sir, we've locked onto a ship,\r  but it's not the rebel craft.\r  It's Lord Vader's ship.\r  Release\r Release him immediately.\r  It's not your fault, Officer.\r  But Lord Vader won't know that.\r  Ahsoka, Hera said\r you wanted to speak with us.\r  Please, come in.\r  Are you okay?\r  I am, thank you.\r  I wanted to ask about the Sith\r Lord you encountered on Lothal.\r  You know we encountered\r an Inquisitor before,\r  but this was nothing like that.\r  The fear, the anger, the hate.\r  You felt it.\r  I haven't sensed a presence\r like that since\r  The Clone Wars.\r  Yeah.\r  Ahsoka, do you know\r who or what he is?\r  No, I don't.\r  But I do know\r that he will be coming.\r  They'll all be coming now.\r  Then we've got to\r be ready to fight.\r  We must find\r the strength to fight,\r  but the greater courage\r is knowing when not to fight.\r  And we'll be beside you\r either way.\r  With their command ship destroyed,\r the rebel fleet has been shattered.\r  You have them on the run\r  Clear the bridge.\r  Lord Vader, have you dealt\r with the rebels in the Lothal system?\r  Yes, Master.\r  They are broken.\r  And yet I sense in you something\r more to your victory.\r  I believe the apprentice\r of Anakin Skywalker lives\r  and is in league\r with these rebels.\r  Are you certain?\r  It was her.\r  This is an opportunity\r we cannot let pass.\r  Skywalker's apprentice could\r lead us to other lost Jedi.\r  Such as Kenobi.\r  Perhaps, if he lives.\r  Be patient, my old friend.\r  For now, dispatch another\r Inquisitor to hunt them down.\r  As you wish, my master.\r      \n                "}, "Double Agent Droid": {"episode": "s03e18", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t1\r (AIRLOCK RELEASING)\r  WEDGE: (OVER COMLINK)\r Don't worry, Phoenix Leader.\r  We'll be back with those codes\r before you know it.\r  Let's hope your copilots aren't more\r of a challenge than the mission.\r  WEDGE: What makes you say that?\r  No reason.\r  (BOTH CHUCKLE)\r  Let's cut the chatter.\r We've got a job to do.\r  Copy that, Phoenix Leader.\r  Despite what you two think, I'm confident\r we have our best team on the job.\r  Okay, since when does our best team\r  include AP-5, Chopper,\r and Wedge?\r  I don't get it, AP-5.\r  Why are you so surprised Hera\r picked me for this mission?\r  Your grasp of protocol is sorely lacking.\r  Imperial pilots never remove\r their helmets in flight.\r  I know, I was top of my class\r at the Imperial Academy.\r  Oh, Lieutenant Antilles,\r you are mistaking\r  my attention to detail for an attack\r on your obviously fragile ego.\r  (CHOPPER GRUNTING)\r  (SIGHS)\r  I want this mission to go\r precisely as planned.\r  We need to acquire the Imperial\r codes for our attack on Lothal.\r  Yeah, I was at the briefing too.\r  (CHOPPER GRUNTING)\r  You just got your circuits\r overheated that I was put in charge.\r  (CHOPPER GRUNTING)\r  Well, it is not\r your mission.

Listen.\r  You hear that?\r  Enemy contact .24.\r  How many legs\r they got?\r  - Looks like four.\r - Four?\r  Well, how are they\r not falling over?\r  Will you look at the size\r of those things. Huh.\r  Reinforced armor plating,\r  heavy cannons\r  and antipersonnel\r blasters. Mmm.\r  I'm glad you guys\r are so excited,\r  but those giant death machines are\r on their way to blow us to bits!\r  Wolffe, set vector\r two-niner-zero.\r  Wait, you're just gonna turn and run?\r Just like that?\r  Well, if you've got a better\r idea, sir, now's the time.\r  I thought you clones\r loved to fight.\r  I do love a battle,\r but on my terms.\r  Gregor, drop the joopa.\r We gotta get moving.\r  Oh.\r  Bye-bye, Big Bongo.\r  - Wolffe, turn 180.\r - Copy that.\r  They're turning tail,\r but they can't outrun us.\r  - Fire at will.\r - Yes, sir.\r  Kanan. I'm not sure how far we'll\r get, but I think she'll fly.\r  Good enough for me.\r Zeb, we're going now.\r  Too late. The walkers are\r already on top of us.\r  He's right, Kanan.\r They'll shoot us down.\r  How will going into that\r storm be any better?\r  Well, the storm will scramble the scanners.\r We'll all be blind.\r  But a Jedi won't.\r  All right,\r everybody inside.\r  Sir, yes, sir.\r  Sir, we're losing them\r in the storm.\r  No, you are losing them\r by slowing down.\r  Full speed ahead.\r  That's it.\r I can't wait any longer.\r  Quiet. Quiet.\r They're right above us.\r  They must have finished their initial scan,\r but I don't want to take any chances.\r  Keep your power on low, and help\r me put this panel back together.\r  Really?\r  You won't be working much\r slower than you normally do.\r  We're not gonna be able to\r hide in this storm forever.\r  Those things are practically\r impervious to blasters,\r  but they have one weak point\r in their armor, the neck.\r  One well-placed shot from the\r main gun should destroy it.\r  That's all we might get,\r one shot.\r  Scopes are dead, sir.\r  They think because we're\r blind, they have a chance.\r  Now we prove them wrong.\r  All units, 30 degrees left,\r flanking turn.\r  I don't know how we're supposed\r to shoot something we can't see.\r  I don't even know\r where the enemy is.\r  You don't always have to see\r something to know where it is.\r  If you're willing to trust me,\r I can get us that shot.\r  I always trust my general.\r  Prepare to stop. Now!\r  We should have\r found them by now.\r  Pincer maneuver.\r  Commander Wolffe,\r circle left, double time.\r  Full stop!\r  If what I'm sensing is\r right, we're surrounded.\r  What?\r  I know they're here.\r  What's your\r next move, clone?\r  You put us right in the middle\r of 'em to get us a shot.\r  It's crazy, but it's\r probably our best chance.\r  Once we fire,\r we'll reveal our location.\r  If we miss, it's all over.\r  I'll take the shot.\r  - No, Ezra should take the shot.\r - Uh, why don't you do it?\r  Kanan's right. We need one Jedi\r up there manning the cannon\r  And another Jedi down here\r to lead us out of this mess.\r  You are the only ones\r who can see in this storm.\r  Sabine, spot him.\r  Hey, kid.\r  You might need that.\r  And hang on tight.\r  Whoa!\r  I gotcha!\r I gotcha! Come on!\r  - Don't miss.\r - Hey, I never miss.\r  Ezra, there's a\r walker somewhere around .5.\r  Somewhere around .5?\r Terrific.\r  Targeting scope's useless.\r  I can't see it.\r  It doesn't matter. You're not\r going to see it with your eyes.\r  The walker is there.\r Trust yourself.\r  - Got 'em.\r - Wolffe, there's your opening.\r  Go for it!\r  Focus fire\r on the energy burst.\r  Has there been any word\r from Agent Kallus?\r  No, sir. All communication and tracking\r was lost when they entered the storm.\r  Admiral Konstantine, we have an\r urgent transmission coming in.\r  Not now. We're in the\r middle of an operation.\r  Sir, the message\r is from Lord Vader.\r  We've been ordered to immediately\r rendezvous with his shuttle.\r  Hang on, hang on.\r Something's happening.\r  This is either really good\r or really bad.\r  You would think \"bad.\"\r  Have you finished the\r last of the repairs?\r  Well, get on it.\r  Great shot, kid.\r  Now get yourself moving.\r This is your only chance.\r  What? We can't leave now.\r  We have to get the information they\r gave us back to the rebellion.\r  The other part of that mission\r is to bring Rex back with us.\r  We can't\r just abandon them.\r  You're not abandoning anyone.\r We're covering your escape.\r  Now, move.\r  We're soldiers, Ezra. This\r is what we were born to do.\r  Wolffe, bring us around.\r  The rebel ship is escaping, but\r Konstantine will deal with them.\r  Let's teach these clones\r just how obsolete they are.\r  Boys, this might be it.\r  At least we'll go down\r fighting like a clone should.\r  I'm with you all the way,\r Captain.\r  Kanan, you know better\r than anyone.\r  They won't give up. This fight\r is gonna be their last.\r  Come on, Wolffe.\r It's just a scratch.\r  Keep moving forward, soldier!\r Onward!\r  Ha-ha!\r  Intensify forward firepower.\r  I'm going for the legs,\r all four of them.\r  They've lost their minds!\r  Ha-ha!\r  We've been outflanked.\r  It's too bad\r about Captain Rex,\r  but at least\r you got the intel.\r  - I'll rendezvous with you shortly. \r - Copy that.\r  What are we gonna\r tell Ahsoka?\r  Rex was her friend,\r even though he was a clone.\r  I hate it when he's right.\r  I've got my problems\r with clones,\r  but I don't want\r those men to die.\r  Gregor, I've lost power\r to the main cannon!\r  I know, I know. I'm working on it, Captain.\r I'm working on it!\r  Come out and fight,\r you cowards!\r  Finish them.\r  Just like the old days.\r  What was that?\r  Hmm.\r  Roomy.\r  Where's Konstantine\r with my air support?\r  Ah-ah. Whoa.\r Power restored.\r  Evacuate!\r Get to the speeders!\r  Looks like we live\r to fight another day.\r  Don't we always?\r  Well, we do when we've\r got a Jedi leading us.\r  Inquisitor, I thought Lord\r Vader was coming aboard.\r  - I wasn't aware that you\r - Lord Vader has sent me in his place.\r  Well, this\r unnecessary diversion\r  may have compromised the success\r of Agent Kallus's mission.\r  We must return. I care\r not for your struggles.\r  I will succeed where you\r and Kallus have failed.\r  Commander.\r  You got old.\r  Had to happen\r sometime, Rex.\r  I'm glad\r you're still alive.\r  You too.\r  Well, I wouldn't be\r if it weren't for these guys.\r  Thank you\r for trusting my friend.\r  It wasn't easy.\r  It's still not.\r  Nothing worth doing\r ever is.\r      \n                "}, "Legacy of Mandalore": {"episode": "s03e15", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t(SIGHS)\r  Welcome home.\r  You really think\r it's gonna be that bad?\r  I haven't been back to Krownest\r  since before my time at\r the Imperial Academy, Ezra.\r  And I didn't exactly\r leave on good terms.\r  Well, maybe things have changed.\r  They might be happy to see you.\r  (CHUCKLES)\r  You don't know my family.\r  FENN: I do.\r  Your mother is the leader\r of Clan Wren, Sabine.\r  She may be with the Empire now,\r  but I believe her true loyalty\r lies with Mandalore.\r  Even if that were true,\r she thinks I'm a traitor.\r  If you can convince your\r mother to help the rebels,\r  all of Mandalore might follow\r you and the Darksaber.\r  Ah, I should let them know we're\r coming so they don't shoot us down.\r  (LAUGHS) That's funny, I\r  Wait, you're not kidding,\r are you?\r  (SPEAKING MANDO'A)\r  (COMMS CHIME)\r  (MAN SPEAKING MANDO'A)\r  (STATIC)\r  - What happened?\r - They're jamming us.\r  (GRUNTING)\r  Incoming.

Are you suggesting\r we allow it to return to the Empire,\r  with a memory bank\r filled with rebel secrets?\r  Well, we can't let it detonate.\r We can't let it go back.\r  Think, Zeb, think!\r  This might take a while.\r  (SIGHS)\r  Can you get\r inside the droid's programming?\r  I believe I can.\r  I want you to wipe its memory.\r  No, its memory core\r is protected.\r  Any attempt to tamper with it\r would likely trigger detonation.\r  Nor can I disarm the warhead.\r  One way or another,\r it is going to explode.\r  It's just a matter of when.\r  Or a matter of where.\r  What if we send it back to\r the Empire still ticking?\r  Can you make an adjustment\r to the warhead,\r  set it to restart the countdown\r  when the droid reconnects\r to the Imperial network?\r  Possibly.\r What are you suggesting?\r  We let it go back to its base,\r  but it blows before\r it can upload its data.\r  Maybe even takes some more\r of these droids with it.\r  The Empire will never know\r which one it was.\r  Well, can you do it or not?\r  (STUTTERS) Yes, I can.\r Or at least I can try.\r  Sorry for my delayed response.\r  I was just rather stunned by the\r fact that you had a good idea.\r  (CHOPPER CHUCKLES)\r  Just get to work fixing it.\r  (CHOPPER GRUNTING FRUSTRATEDLY)\r  Oh, good point, Chopper.\r  It may try to kill us, so I will\r restore the droid's behavioral system\r  to the disarmed state\r in which we found it.\r  I will also initiate its\r return-to-base protocol\r  so it should promptly\r leave peacefully.\r  (CHOPPER GRUNTING)\r  Main system restart now.\r  (POWERING UP)\r  (WHISPERS) It's leaving the base.\r Good job.\r  Let's make sure it gets home.\r  I'm picking up a second signal.\r  Must be its ship.\r  There it is.\r  (BEEPING)\r  That's a long-range transmitter.\r  It's going to contact\r the Empire.\r  Not if I can help it.\r  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)\r  (SATELLITE DISH CLANKING)\r  (CIRCUITS SCRAMBLING)\r  Yes!\r  (LAUGHS)\r  We did it.

Our new exit?\r - Landing platform.\r  We were lucky to\r have escaped with our lives.\r  But I learned something.\r  Ezra, I'm not gonna try\r to teach you anymore.\r  If all I do is try, that means I\r don't truly believe I can succeed.\r  So from now on, I will teach you.\r  I may fail, you may\r fail, but there is no try.\r  I understand, Master.\r  Didn't get\r any easier for the kid.\r  Next he had to join\r the Academy as a cadet\r  to infiltrate the Imperial Headquarters.\r  At least this time he had some backup\r  to help him steal the Empire's secrets.\r  Decode the hyperspace coordinates\r and get them to Spectre-1.\r  - This decoder better be worth the risk.\r - What's the alternative?\r  Do you want to stop that\r Kyber shipment or not?\r  If you're not too busy,\r attack the Academy tomorrow at noon.\r  I could use the diversion\r so I can get out of here.\r  - It wasn't enough for Ezra\r to get away.  - Get in.\r  He helped others escape too.\r  But when all you do is hit and run,\r never really winning a battle,\r  it can challenge your faith\r in your mission and each other.\r  Sometimes it seems like\r the harder we fight,\r  the harder things get out there.\r  I feel like we can't take\r down the Empire on our own.\r  That's why I need to know\r this isn't all for nothing.\r  I need to know that I am not\r  walking into another nightmare here.\r  Sabine, run!\r  Spectre-2 to Spectre-4, come in.\r  - We have a situation.\r - We're on our way. Ghost out.\r  They're coming in from both sides.\r  There's always something\r out there trying to tear us apart.\r  They just keep coming.\r  But when things are darkest,\r we always come through for each other.\r  - At least we have so far.\r - Sabine, I got your back.\r  I know you have questions,\r questions I can't answer right now.\r  But we are making a difference, Sabine,\r  and I promise, we won't always\r be fighting this battle alone.\r  In the Force, Ezra would\r discover you're never alone.\r  Make a connection with another being.\r  You're connected to every\r living thing in the universe.\r  But to discover that, you\r have to let your guard down.\r  You have to be willing\r to attach to others.\r  Empire Day was a turning\r point for Ezra and all of us.\r  Okay, let's start the celebration.\r  Copy that.\r Commencing festivities.\r  These rebels have ruined Empire Day!\r  - They must be punished.\r - We all want that, Minister.\r  But our priority is still the Rodian.\r    The name's Tseebo,\r a friend of my parents.\r  But something's wrong.\r What's that thing on his head?\r    What's he saying?\r  He's detailing Imperial\r fighter deployments on Lothal.\r  That's it. Tseebo has intel the\r Empire doesn't want getting out.\r  We'll need to smuggle him off Lothal.\r  Get in.\r  Go! Go!\r  Shields won't hold\r long under this barrage.\r  Ezra. Ezra Bridger.\r  Ezra Bridger.\r    What's he saying?\r  He says he knows what\r happened to your parents.\r  I already know what\r happened. They're dead.\r  Hang on!\r  - I sense movement in the Force.\r - Yes.\r  The tracker indicates the rebel\r ship has emerged from hyperspace.\r  As Hera got Tseebo to safety,\r  Ezra and I lured\r the Inquisitor into a trap.\r  Or at least that was the plan.\r  One with the Force.\r One with the Force.\r  One with the Force. One with the Force.\r  - Don't be afraid!\r - I'm not afraid of them.\r  I'm afraid of\r I'm afraid of the truth.\r  Sorry. I'm sorry.\r I forgive you, Tseebo.\r  I, too, am sorry.\r Forgive me.\r  They're here, all right.\r The rebel ship is inside.\r  Keep them contained.\r I want them alive.\r  Sir, they're not alone.\r  Shoot it, shoot it!\r  I made a mistake.\r  No!\r  I underestimated\r Ezra's growing power\r  and what he might do with it.\r  Ezra? No.\r  I hadn't prepared him\r for the power of the dark side.\r  The time had come to see if he\r had what it took to become a Jedi.\r  The Jedi Temple would be\r where Ezra's real trial began. \r  In here, you'll have to face your\r worst fears and overcome them.\r  The Inquisitor.\r  Kanan, no!\r  Your master lies dead and\r rotting in a forgotten tunnel.\r  You could hardly have let him down more.\r  I'm not afraid.\r  Master Yoda.\r  A dangerous time\r this is for your apprentice.\r  I feel as if his abilities\r are growing faster\r  than I can teach him.\r I lost my way for a long time,\r  but now I have\r a chance to change things.\r  I won't let him lose his way.\r  Not like I did.\r  Big fears have you faced.\r  Ahead of you a difficult\r path there is, Padawan.\r  A Jedi you may yet be.\r  I don't believe it.\r It's a lightsaber crystal.\r  I was proud of him,\r and I don't think I was alone.\r  Then we ran into this lowdown, dirty,\r  Sabacc-cheating entrepreneur.\r  Name's Calrissian.\r Lando Calrissian.\r  From the moment\r we met this Lando,\r  there was nothing but trouble.\r  Karabast!\r  But that's another story,\r  one Chopper will tell you.\r  My small metal friend,\r we shall meet again.\r  It wasn't long after, Ezra\r had his first vision of the future.\r  Your parents were very brave.\r  I saw Gall Trayvis.\r Kanan, he knew my parents!\r  Following his vision,\r we set out to save Trayvis.\r  Senator, you're\r in terrible danger.\r  - The Empire knows you're here.\r - That's impossible.\r  Turns out it was a trap,\r but this time we were ready.\r  Stay close, Senator.\r  We'll draw them away.\r Get Spectre-2 and Trayvis to the hatch.\r  - We're not going anywhere.\r - But you're not a traitor.\r  You're a voice of freedom,\r  a-a light in the darkness,\r like my parents!\r  Parents?\r  No one has spoken against\r the Empire on Lothal since\r  the Bridger transmissions.\r  Your parents were very brave\r and very foolish.\r  You know, I wanted to believe\r in Trayvis as much as you did.\r  - Yeah. What's wrong with us?\r - We have hope.\r  Hope that things can get better.\r  And they will.\r  Things were about to get worse.\r A lot worse.\r  From now on, \r failure will have consequences.\r  To lift our spirits,\r we took over an Imperial tower\r  to beam out our own transmission.\r  Chopper, install the spike.\r  We ran into some complications.\r  Sabine, we got targets\r incoming. Let's move!\r  - Not this way. Back inside.\r - Are you crazy?\r  Take the lift.\r Hera will meet you at the top.\r  - Wait. What about you?\r - I'll take the next one.\r  All I could do was buy time.\r  Kanan!\r  Spectre-2, get out of here!\r  Not an option, Kanan.\r  - No time. Go!\r - We can't.\r  It appears the insurgents\r have gained control\r  of the tower's transmitter.\r  We are rebels\r fighting for the people,\r  fighting for you.\r  It's only going to get worse\r unless we stand up and fight back.\r  Stand up together because\r that's when we're strongest.\r  The transmission Ezra was able to\r beam out has attracted attention.\r  To protect your unit, to protect Ezra,\r you must stop your search for Kanan.\r  He's our friend.\r Hera, I can't just forget him,\r  and I can't believe you would either.\r  His resistance is impressive.\r  I recommend we transfer him\r from Lothal to another location,\r  one that never fails\r to extract a confession.\r  The Mustafar system?\r  I've only heard that name once.\r From Kanan.\r  He said Mustafar is\r where Jedi go to die.\r  Even if I ordered\r them not to come after me,\r  they would have.\r  - That's not regulation.\r - I kind of like it.\r  And I have to admit,\r it was a great plan.\r  Well, maybe a good plan,\r for the most part.\r  Hope Ezra has\r found Kanan by now.\r  You shouldn't have come here,\r but I'm glad you did.\r  You would have done the same for me.\r  This is Fulcrum. \r Who is this?\r  No!\r  There are some things far\r more frightening than death.\r  Kanan.\r  I thought I lost you.\r  I know the feeling.\r Let's go home.\r  Without Chopper's transport,\r we're going nowhere.\r  - Who is that?  - I don't know,\r but I think they're on our side.\r  We didn't know it,\r  but we were already part\r of a bigger rebel movement.\r  And these rebels\r were full of surprises.\r  Fulcrum.\r  Ahsoka. My name is Ahsoka Tano.\r  Many in this system and\r beyond have heard your message.\r  You gave them hope in\r their darkest times.\r  This is a new day, a new beginning.\r  And whatever this new day\r brings, I think we'll be ready.\r  Not to worry.

They're more clever\r than you would think, and creative.\r  That doesn't mean\r they aren't dangerous as well.\r  So, Rex, how do you know\r Saw Gerrera?\r  Oh, we go way back.\r  I trained him and his sister,\r Steela, during the Clone War.\r  They were part of a plan\r to help localized militias\r  fight for themselves\r against the Separatists.\r  She didn't make it.\r  But he carried on\r  and even started his own rebel\r cell after the Empire took over.\r  Hey, I think\r I found something.\r  Looks like some\r kind of passage down there.\r  This is the entrance\r to the tunnels.\r  Looks like\r it was deliberately sealed.\r  Well, not sealed enough.\r  This must be\r where Saw's team went in.\r  (GRUNTING)\r  Chopper's still not picking\r up signals of any kind.\r  Let's go take a look.\r  So what do they look like?\r The Geonosians?\r  REX: Well, they kind of look like\r battle droids, to tell you the truth.\r  Ugly battle droids\r that smell.\r  Hmm. Looks like all these side\r passages have been blocked off.\r  REX: Yeah. Deliberately.\r Just like above.\r  Why would they do that?\r  The air is still\r down here.\r  The sealed passages\r must be blocking the airflow.\r  Certainly limits our options\r for going forward.\r  Here!\r  I found a helmet.\r  I know this marking.\r It's from Saw's team.\r  (GRUNTING)\r  There's another.\r Oh, and more down there.\r  All from Saw's unit.\r  But where are\r the people?\r  They must've\r been attacked.\r  By who?\r  (FAINT CHITTERING)\r  There's something up ahead.\r  (CHITTERING CONTINUES)\r  It's moving away.\r  What is it?\r  It's gone.\r We should go too.\r  Go?\r  Kanan, why? We have\r to find Saw's rebels.\r  Ezra, all we found are sealed\r up tunnels and some rebel gear.\r  There's something working\r against us.\r  I'm not sure what,\r  but we're out of our element\r and away from our team.\r  We'll just call for backup.\r Chop, get Hera.\r  (SCANNING)\r  (GRUNTING)\r  (SIGHS) We must be too deep.\r The signal can't reach her.\r  Someone's down here, and I\r bet they know what happened.\r  I say we go on.\r  Rex, it's up to you\r to break the tie.\r  (GRUNTING)\r  Nope, you don't get a vote.\r  (GRUNTING FRUSTRATEDLY)\r  Well, if you want my opinion,\r I say we press on.\r  I know Saw would do\r the same for me.\r  Okay, we'll keep going.\r  But there's times I hate being right,\r and I hope this isn't one of 'em.\r  (FAINT CHITTERING)\r  I don't understand.\r Where did the rebels go?\r  It's just a dead end.\r  KANAN: (GROANS)\r Do you have to call it that?\r  (DISTANT CLATTERING)\r  EZRA: Look!\r Are those Geonosians?\r  Not Geonosians.\r Clankers.\r  Halt.\r You will be eliminated.\r  Battle droids.\r  We can do this.\r  Oh. Uh\r  Blast 'em!\r  Okay, we can\r probably do this.\r  Nice.\r  Jedi! Open fire!\r  (YELPS)\r  What was that?\r  It wasn't the droids.\r  We've been outflanked!\r  (METAL CLATTERING)\r  Saw.\r  Captain Rex.\r  So, you decided to come\r to Geonosis after all.\r  Yeah. To rescue you.\r  Is that what's happening?\r (CHUCKLES)\r  It's good to see you alive,\r my old friend.\r  I want you to meet\r Kanan and Ezra.\r  (GRUNTING)\r  Oh, right, and Chopper.\r  So, you're Jedi.\r  We do our best.\r  Never thought I'd meet\r another Jedi,\r  much less two.\r  The galaxy is\r full of surprises.\r  Including what's happening\r here on Geonosis.\r  You've found something?\r  How's it going out there?\r  SABINE: (GROANS) This storm is gonna\r seriously damage my paint job.\r  I meant with the mission.\r  We're closing in on the power source.\r It's just up ahead.\r  ZEB: Whatever it is,\r it's big.\r  How do you know that?\r  Look.\r  SABINE: Oh, I don't believe it.\r  Spectre-5, what do you see?\r  Hera, it's a shield generator.\r  I didn't copy, Spectre-5.\r  Did you say\r \"shield generator\"?\r  SABINE: Oh, yeah.\r Military grade.\r  Looks like\r it's fully operational.\r  This is what's responsible\r for those power readings.\r  HERA: Can you extract\r the deflector core?\r  Well, it won't be easy in\r this storm, but we can do it.\r  Luck's on our side\r for a change.\r  Chopper Base\r could really use a shield.\r  Get to work.\r I'll contact Kanan.\r  (BEEPS)\r  Ghost to Spectre-1.\r Do you read me?\r  - (STATIC)\r - (GROANS)\r  Spectre-1, come in.\r  So this shield, what do you\r think it was protecting?\r  What do you mean?\r  (BEEPING)\r  You don't just find a fully\r operational shield generator\r  on a deserted planet\r for no reason.\r  Good point.\r You know what that means?\r  Um, no. What does that mean?\r  Work fast!\r  A shield generator?\r  Separatist model.\r  About as old as you, Rex.\r  But someone's kept it\r operational, been maintaining it.\r  Battle droids?\r  (CHUCKLES)\r These old clankers?\r  Not a chance.\r  Technology's too\r sophisticated.\r  Besides, by the look of 'em,\r  someone's been\r repairing them too.\r  Well, we were following\r something.\r  That's how we wound up\r in this trap.\r  It was a bug. Had to be.\r  He got my unit\r using the same tactics.\r  I was the only survivor.\r  Yeah, the more I hear,\r the more I don't like this.\r  We should go back\r and report to Hera.\r  Back? No. Wait.\r  You can't. That bug is the key to\r finding out what's going on here.\r  Don't you understand\r what's at stake?\r  We know the Empire wiped out the\r entire population of this planet.\r  We need to find out why.\r  The Empire is hiding something,\r something important, and that bug\r  knows what it is.\r  He's right.\r I say we help Saw.\r  Hmm. I second that.\r  Okay. We can stay\r and search for the bug,\r  but we have to warn Hera\r about the droids first.\r  I can help you with that.\r This way.\r  I've been able to map a fair\r amount of these tunnels.\r  There's a breeze.\r  Whoa. Watch your step,\r Master Jedi.\r  (CHUCKLING)\r It's a long way down.\r  EZRA: Whoa.\r  I tracked the bug\r to this shaft.\r  But it severed the bridge, so I've\r never been able to get across.\r  How far down does it go?\r  Down, I don't know.\r  But it goes all the way up\r to the surface.\r  That's why\r you feel the air, so\r  - We can contact our ship.\r - Exactly.\r  KANAN: Spectre-1 to Ghost.\r Do you copy?\r  Spectre-2, come in.\r  Spectre-1, I read you.\r  Where have you been, Kanan?\r What's going on?\r  We found Saw Gerrera,\r but his team is gone.\r  Gone?\r  Hera, listen to me.\r  There are operational\r battle droids here.\r  Some patrol the surface.\r Better keep an eye out.\r  Sabine and Zeb found\r a shield generator.\r  They're out there\r extracting the deflector core.\r  You have to warn them.\r  Gerrera says once the storm dies\r down, the droids will be coming.\r  Looks like\r the storm's letting up.\r  HERA: Spectre-4, Spectre-5. Get\r back to the Ghost immediately.\r  Affirmative, Spectre-2. We've got\r the deflector core, and we're\r  Leave it if you have to. There\r are battle droids in the area.\r  I don't know how many.\r  Battle droids?\r  I don't see any\r battle droids.\r  I just see\r a bunch of rocks.\r  I'm not sure\r those are rocks.\r  Destroyers.\r  Oh, no.\r  We'll make short work\r of these tin cans.\r  No. There's too many, Zeb.\r  If you blast one,\r you'll wake them all up.\r  SABINE: Okay, what about\r the Ghost cannons?\r  No good. The sandstorm's\r clogged up the barrels.\r  They're spread out enough.\r  I guess we can just\r sneak past them on foot.\r  No. We can't just leave\r the deflector core.\r  Are you crazy?\r Like Hera said,\r  if we bump into one of those\r things, they'll all wake up.\r  Okay, okay. So we'll take our\r time and we'll go carefully.\r  Are you sure it's not too\r big to make it through?\r  Hey, you made it\r through.\r  Good point.\r  HERA: All right, boys.\r I'm calling it.\r  Get back to the surface before these\r battle droids or anything else wakes up.\r  Copy that, Hera.\r  Now wait a minute.\r We're not going anywhere.\r  We need to go\r help our friends.\r  Want to help\r your friends?\r  Then find out who's\r controlling those droids.\r  Ezra, far side of the chasm, directly\r across from us. Do you see anything?\r  Chopper, light it up.\r  (CHITTERS)\r  There! Look!\r  I knew it!\r  REX: Still ugly.\r  (SPEAKS GEONOSIAN)\r  What's it holding?\r  (BEEPS)\r  Hera, the droids\r are waking up!\r  Kanan, we've got a problem. The\r droids have been activated.\r  - The bug did it.\r - Sabine and Zeb are in trouble. Let's go!\r  (SPEAKS GEONOSIAN)\r  We're not leaving\r without that bug.\r  He's not as important\r as our friends.\r  You'll never reach them\r in time.\r  We capture the bug,\r we turn off the droids,\r  we save your friends.\r  What do you think, Hera?\r  It's a good plan.\r Get the bug.\r  Ezra, I'm sending you\r over there on three.\r  One. Two. Three!\r  (GRUNTS)\r  Chopper, go with him.\r  Even with your help,\r I can't jump that far.\r  I've got a better idea.\r  You thinking\r what I'm thinking?\r  For once, yes.\r  - ZEB: What about the deflector core?\r - SABINE: Leave it.\r  Zeb, Sabine, wait.\r Don't leave it. Use it!\r  How, exactly? It's\r disconnected from the array.\r  Wait, wait. She's right.\r  I can tie it to the core's power\r supply and minimize the field.\r  Minimize any faster?\r  Huh. Not bad.\r  Heh. Thanks.\r  But it won't hold forever.\r  KANAN: I need you to blast\r one of those bridges loose.\r  I think I know\r what you have in mind.\r  Get across!\r  (PANTING)\r  What about Kanan?\r  Come on.\r We gotta get moving.\r  I always forget\r they can do that.\r  Yeah, but he's\r no Skywalker.\r  KANAN: I heard that.\r  Down here. I think.\r  Chopper, any sign of him?\r  (GRUNTING)\r  (GRUNTING EXCITEDLY)\r  (CHITTERS)\r  Go. Go!\r  This way.\r  Let's split up. You go\r that way and cut him off.\r  Oh! What? Chopper! How did he get past you?\r Where did he go?\r  Not good. Not good!\r  (YELPS)\r  Gotcha.\r  (GRUNTING)\r  (GRUNTS)\r  Chopper, grab the remote!\r  (GROANS)\r  (CHITTERS)\r  The shield's failing!\r  (YELPS)\r  (GRUNTS) Huh?\r  Ah. Mind if we\r don't do that again?\r  (WHIMPERING)\r  It's over.\r  That's right. We got you.\r  (CHITTERING)\r  And now you're gonna tell us\r what's been going on here.\r  What were you building\r for the Empire?\r  (SPEAKING GEONOSIAN)\r      \n                "}, "Legends Of The Lasat": {"episode": "s02e12", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tEzra, I'm proud of you for taking\r the lead on this rescue mission.\r  You would've done\r the same thing.\r  You said these people\r are wanted by the Empire.\r  - Do you know why?\r - No, but I hear they're closing in.\r  We better hurry.\r  So where'd you hear\r about these refugees anyway?\r  Huh?

I do.\r  Well, since I'm so uneducated,\r why don't you explain your problem?\r  These creatures are a menace.\r A big, lumbering menace.\r  - Uh, something's upsetting it.\r - Maybe it's Hera.\r  No, it's not Hera.\r  TIE fighters. Two of 'em.\r I need a better angle.\r  Hang on!\r  Those TIEs have been modified.\r They're not Imperial.\r  Well, they're acting like it.\r  I've got him.\r I've got him.\r  Hera, I lost my cannons.\r  Rerouting auxiliary power\r from the Phantom.\r  Oh, karabast!\r  Hera!\r  Oh, see? If we shot\r at the Purrgil, we wouldn't have had\r  - Those fighters were Mining Guild.\r - They must be from the refinery.\r  You think you can track\r where they came from?\r  Maybe. Give me a minute.\r  As I was saying,\r it's a good thing\r  we didn't waste energy\r shooting at the Purrgil.\r  I heard you the first time.\r  Something's happening.\r  They're turning around.\r I think we should follow them.\r  Following them is the\r last thing we should do.\r  Sabine, did you find out where\r the fighters came from yet?\r  - I did. \r - Good. What's our heading?\r  - Follow the Purrgil.\r - What?\r  Yeah, I hate to tell you this,\r  but the Purrgil are heading right where\r I calculated those fighters came from.\r  That's so interesting.\r  All right. I guess for now\r we follow the Purrgil.\r  Hey. For what it's worth, I've\r got a good feeling about this.\r  Go check your cabins. Make sure\r everything is switched off.\r  We've gotta save every \r little bit of fuel.\r  Come on, big guy.\r  It's colder back there.\r  I never imagined there were\r creatures in deep space.\r  When I was young,\r I was told amazing stories\r  of creatures that lived in the stars,\r  traveled between the worlds.\r  Old pilots said it was the Purrgil\r  who inspired us to jump\r from system to system.\r  But I don't believe it.\r  The Purrgil are dangerous.\r  They wander into hyperspace\r lanes, crash into ships.\r  I've lost more than\r one friend that way.\r  Well, maybe they don't realize\r they're putting people in danger.\r  Maybe it's like Kanan says,\r you know.\r  They just do what they do.\r  Right now, as long as they don't\r come between me and my mission,\r  I really don't care what they do.\r  Fair enough.\r  Scanners are picking up an energy\r source from that planetoid ahead.\r  You think  it's the refinery?\r  We're about to find out.\r  There it is. The refinery.\r  I wonder why the Purrgil\r are headed that way.\r  Works out for us.\r  Between them and all these asteroids, the\r Mining Guild will never see us coming.\r  The automatic doors\r aren't so automatic anymore.\r  I've rationed what\r energy we have left.\r  - What's your next move?\r - I want to get a secure position\r  to plan our attack.\r  Sabine, Chopper, ready a short,\r controlled burst from the engines.\r  In three, two, one.\r  Now!\r  Okay. So how exactly are we gonna pull off\r this raid with our limited resources?\r  Well, give me a second\r and I'll tell you.\r  Okay. More fighters. That's not good.\r  Anti-ship cannon, also not good.\r  But Aha.\r  There's the Empire's shipment.\r  Okay, lots of guards around,\r  but I think we can drop down\r there, scoop it up and go.\r  Forget the scoop job.\r  We have just barely enough\r fuel to get down there.\r  We'll have to land.\r  Refuel on the platform?\r  They'll blast us to bits.\r We need a diversion.\r  I've got one.\r  The gas in that pool\r is unrefined clouzon-36.\r  Highly explosive in its pure form.\r  We drop in a few charges,\r  the blast will provide\r all the diversion we need.\r  - In the chaos, we grab the fuel.\r - And that huge fireball\r  will destroy the Empire's\r ability to refine more.\r  I like it. Ezra, you hear the plan?\r  Yeah. Sure.\r  Uh, they're using the cannon\r to shoot the Purrgil.\r  Why would they bother?\r  Speaking of, how do we get\r past that gun undetected?\r  - We jump.\r - Excuse me?\r  We're in the upper atmosphere.\r  We can glide in on the catwalk.\r  With all the Purrgil around, we\r can probably slip by unseen.\r  - Sounds like a dangerous plan.\r - Don't worry, buddy.\r  - You're staying here.\r - Oh. Sounds like a good plan.\r  The Purrgil and the gas\r are connected.\r  Hey, uh, guys?\r  Not now, Ezra. You've gotta\r prep for the mission.\r  But I think the Purrgil want the fuel.\r  Well, so do we.\r  Get going.\r  Why are those flying leeches back?\r  I sent two fighters to destroy them.\r  Pilots haven't reported in, sir.\r  Perhaps they've run into trouble.\r  These creatures have eaten\r enough of our fuel.\r  I don't want to hear\r our cannons stop firing\r  until all of those things are dead.\r  Sabine, do you have\r the helmet I lent you?\r  What?\r  You said you just\r wanted to look at it.\r  I did look at it.\r And it looked bad.\r  I think it looks great.\r  Wait. We're not taking the Phantom?\r  You know, you should\r really pay more attention.\r  - How are we getting down there?\r - Like Kanan said.\r  We jump.\r  Wow.\r  Five seconds.\r  Oh, no. Oh, no! No!\r  - I'm gonna have to work on that.\r - I'm gonna make sure you do.\r  Look out!\r  So much for our stealth mission.\r  Sabine. Toss the detonators.\r  I'm on it.\r  Detonators?\r  Ezra, are you crazy?\r  We can't blow up the gas!\r  Don't tell me this is \r about the Purrgil.\r  It is.\r  Hold that thought. Sabine!\r  Hey.\r  Okay. Explain yourself.\r  Okay. The gas and the\r Purrgil are connected.\r  We can't blow up the gas\r without hurting them.\r  - Hmm.\r - Kanan, what's the plan?\r  I trust your instincts, kid. Now\r get on that cannon and cover us.\r  What exactly are we doing?\r  We're going to secure the landing zone.\r  Uh-oh. There's no explosion.\r  How come there's no explosion?\r  - Sabine, what's going on?\r - We're improvising, again.\r  Kanan and I are securing the landing zone\r while Ezra covers us with the cannon.\r  Who changed the plan?\r  - The Purrgil changed the plan.\r - Not the Purrgil again.\r  Are you sure you can secure\r the landing platform?\r  Once I start heading down\r there, I can't turn back.\r  Hera, if you're looking for a guarantee,\r you are on the wrong mission.\r  We'll contact you when\r the platform is clear.\r  Next time, we just plan on\r the plan changing.\r  Boss Yushyn,\r  - we have intruders on the patrol bridge.\r - Fuel thieves. Alert our sentries.\r  Protect the shipment at all costs.\r  Where's my cover fire?\r  Working on it.\r  Careful! Don't hit the fuel.\r  Hera, you better get down here. Your\r landing zone is temporarily secure.\r  Then it's a good thing we're here.\r  I'll get the fuel.\r  Make it fast.\r  Oh. They're back.\r  Spectre-6, do you copy?\r  Kanan, I figured it out. You're\r not going to believe this.\r  I believe I need more cover fire!\r  Yes! Right. Uh, sorry.\r  Launch fighters.\r  I thought you said the\r landing platform was secure.\r  Temporarily. I said temporarily secure.\r  Refuel commencing.\r  Come on, come on.\r  We've got fighters. Ezra.\r  Ezra!\r  Ezra, where are you?\r  Ezra? Come in, Ezra!\r  Help, help me.\r  I understand.\r  We want to help you.\r  Let us help you.\r  Thank\r  Thank you. You saved my life.\r  - We need to find Ezra.\r - Without fuel, we can't find anybody.\r  Ezra's down. We need to \r get out of here.\r  Just a few more seconds.\r  Time's up.\r  Surrender, thieves.\r You are at my mercy.\r  I can't believe we're gonna \r lose to this guy.\r  What is your answer?\r  Kanan, don't worry.\r We'll be right there.\r  We?\r  I don't believe it.\r  We found Ezra.\r  Blast those disgusting things!\r  - How's the Ghost?\r - We're back in action.\r  This is the last one.\r  Go. Go!\r  Forget the beasts. Stop that ship!\r  Hold them off. I'll cover you.\r  Keep away. Keep away!\r  It wasn't like anything\r I've ever experienced.\r  I could see what they were thinking.\r  You must have established a\r deep connection with them.\r  I guess so.\r  I could see they need gas\r to breathe and travel.\r  The crater wasn't their home,\r just one stop on a long journey.\r  I have to admit, without\r the help of the Purrgil,\r  we never would have gotten\r off the ground again.\r  Whoa. Look.\r  Can it be?\r  It is true.\r  They can travel through hyperspace.\r  We better get moving, too.\r  Back to the fleet?\r  How 'bout we follow the Purrgil?\r      \n                "}, "Hera's Heroes": {"episode": "s03e04", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tHow did they find us?\r  The Empire is getting better\r at anticipating our moves.\r  This will slow them down.\r (GRUNTS)\r  Gobi, where are you?\r We need a pickup now!\r  We are not far from the Tulara Ravine.\r  We can lose them in the maze.\r  No good.

Very popular.\r  If your information is as good as\r you claim, then we have a deal.\r  I give to you the planet Yarma.\r  And hidden in its cloudy\r heavens, Reklam Station,\r  a secret Imperial salvage yard\r  where thousands of\r Republic starfighters\r  are being dismantled for scrap.\r  My former friend Terba\r worked on the line there\r  before he was arrested\r for trying to escape.\r  Y-wings? Kinda old.\r Can they fly?\r  Those bombers may be old, but they\r were solid in combat operations.\r  If we could steal a squadron's worth\r  They would be key to\r building a strike fleet,\r  one capable of our next objective,\r  the destruction of the\r Empire's factory on Lothal.\r  Then what are we waiting for?\r Let's go get 'em.\r  Not so fast.\r We need to scout it first.\r  Confirm Hondo's intel\r and recon its defenses.\r  You still do not trust Hondo,\r  given our history together?\r  You wound me to the quick, madam.\r  Ezra Bridger, I trusted you\r with the last mission,\r  and your success\r has not gone unnoticed.\r  You will lead this mission\r as Lieutenant Commander.\r  Lieutenant? A promotion?\r  (CHUCKLES) You earned it, kid.\r  - Way to go!\r - Well done, young Jedi.\r  Congratulations, Ezra.\r Kanan will be proud of you.\r  Yeah?\r  Well, he has a funny way of showing\r it, considering he's never around.\r  MALE VOICE: I see you.\r  (HISSING)\r  MALE VOICE: I see you.\r  Come to me.\r  Kanan, I was hoping to\r see you at the briefing.\r  KANAN: I hear Ezra's doing well.\r  He has been stepping up, but, uh\r  You know, he blames himself\r for what happened to you and Ahsoka.\r  Well, I don't.\r  I wish you would tell him that.\r  (DOOR OPENS)\r  Kanan. Uh, hey, what\r are you doing here?\r  I think it's time for us to talk.\r  Really? Uh, now\r is not a good time.\r  I've been promoted and assigned\r a really important mission.\r  Yeah, I've heard.\r  The Sith holocron?\r  You opened it?\r  Yeah, I opened it. So what?\r  Ezra, you know only someone who uses\r the dark side can open this thing.\r  The things I've learned from it\r have really helped me.\r  - You're using it?\r - Maybe you should, too.\r  You might actually learn something.\r  Ezra, do you have any idea\r how dangerous this path is?\r  Everything I've learned has helped\r me win one battle after another.\r  I'm using it for good.\r  Acting out of anger\r offers quick results,\r  - but it's a trap!\r - Not for me!\r  (SIGHS)\r  I can't let you keep this.\r  (DOOR OPENS)\r  Fine. I don't need it.\r  Just like I don't need you.\r  We can't jump directly\r to Yarma from here.\r  We'll have to drop out of hyperspace\r  at the Sereeda Waypoint\r and plot a new jump.\r  Do not take too long. That\r is Mining Guild territory.\r  If they spot us, they'll alert\r the Empire and jeopardize my payment.\r  (CHUCKLING) I mean, our mission.\r  We'll be there and gone\r before they know it. Right, Chop?\r  (AGREEING IN DROID LANGUAGE)\r  MALE VOICE: I can help you.\r  Where are you?\r  Who are you?\r  MALE VOICE: Come to me.\r  Okay, Chopper, you're up.\r  Program those coordinates\r fast before\r  MINING GUILD CAPTAIN: (OVER\r COMMUNICATOR) Attention, shuttle craft.\r  You're trespassing in\r a Mining Guild claim zone.\r  Identify yourselves.\r State your business.\r  Uh-oh.\r  MINING GUILD CAPTAIN: (OVER\r COMMUNICATOR) State your purpose.\r  Please excuse the intrusion, Captain.\r  We'll be on our way as soon as we\r calculate our hyperspace jump.\r  MINING GUILD CAPTAIN: We will\r not authorize any such jump\r  until you've registered with the\r Empire and paid the hyperspace toll.\r  Prepare to transfer credits.\r  If you do not slow your speed,\r  we will open fire.\r  Sabine, get us out of here.\r  (HISSING)\r  (HOOTING)\r  (HOOTING CONTINUES)\r  (CREATURE SHRIEKS)\r  (DEVICE HUMMING)\r  This is the place.\r  Hello?\r  Are you there?\r  I can sense your presence.\r  Hello.\r  Imperial prison is bad,\r  but where the Mining Guild\r will send us is worse!\r  Hang on!\r  Brace yourselves.\r  Chopper, we're clear.\r Charge the hyperdrive.\r  Wait. We should destroy the transport\r  - before they contact the Empire.\r - They probably already have.\r  No! We're not leaving\r any witnesses.\r  That's not our mission, Ezra.\r  She's right, Lieutenant.\r  The important thing here is\r to proceed with our mission.\r  Fine. Make the jump.\r  Hyperspace, here we come.\r  Ah. You heard my call. Good.\r  Your imbalance woke me\r from a deep slumber.\r  Imbalance?\r  Your presence is like a violent\r storm in this quiet world.\r  You're a Force wielder.\r  But you're not a Jedi.\r  Wielder? Hmm.\r  Jedi and Sith wield\r the Ashla and Bogan,\r  the light and the dark.\r  I'm the one in the middle, the Bendu.\r  What do you call yourself?\r  I am Kanan Jarrus, Jedi Knight.\r  You carry conflict with you,\r Kanan Jarrus, Jedi Knight.\r  - It's this.\r - (CHUCKLING)\r  Ah. Interesting.\r  KANAN: Careful. It's\r  (SIGHS)\r  dangerous.\r  How so?\r  It's a Sith holocron, a source of evil.\r  My student's been using it,\r  and I'm afraid it's changing him.\r  An object cannot make you good or evil.\r  The temptation of power,\r forbidden knowledge,\r  even the desire to do good can\r lead some down that path.\r  But only you can change yourself.\r  Not always.\r  A-ha!\r  Your conflict becomes clear.\r  That device in the ground,\r why do you have it?\r  It keeps the spiders from attacking me.\r  May I see it?\r  Hey, hey! What did you do?\r  I am helping you.\r  It was the only thing protecting\r me from those creatures!\r  You believe that,\r  but you must learn to\r see things differently now.\r  Look, I can't see\r anything, not anymore.\r  No. You are unwilling.\r  Are you saying there's a way\r to restore my vision?\r  Your sight cannot be healed,\r  but I can teach you to see\r  if you're willing.\r  What must I do?\r  I'm certain Governor Pryce\r is overestimating\r  how organized the resistance is.\r  While it's true there are\r pockets of rebellion,\r  there has never been any evidence\r of a larger scale, galaxy-wide operation.\r  And I would like to keep it that way,\r  Admiral Konstantine.\r  - Grand Admiral Thrawn.\r - \"Grand Admiral\"?\r  The Emperor recently promoted\r me after my victory at Batonn.\r  Civilian casualties outnumbered\r the insurgents at the time.\r  Acceptable margins, Agent Kallus,\r  for there are no longer\r rebels in that sector.\r  Well, Thrawn, what do you think\r of Governor Pryce's theory\r  about the rebels in the Lothal sector?\r  This is a pirate our rebels\r rescued from Naraka prison,\r  Hondo Ohnaka.\r  Within the last hour,\r the Phoenix Squadron\r  destroyed Mining Guild ships\r  using the Sereeda Hyperspace Waypoint.\r  Taken separately,\r they may seem unrelated,\r  but Ohnaka's cellmate\r  was a laborer at our\r starfighter reclamation plant\r  in the Yarma system,\r  one jump point away\r from the Sereeda attack.\r  Grand Admiral Thrawn believes the\r rebels intend to raid the plant\r  and steal fighters for their fleet.\r  Every ship they add to their\r arsenal increases the threat\r  to our own armada\r and the Emperor's plans.\r  I trust you have a solution?\r  I will start my operations here\r  and pull the rebels apart\r piece by piece.\r  They will be the architects\r of their own destruction.\r  No Imperial traffic on the scopes,\r  but no sign of the station either.\r  It is down there, my friends.\r  And those ships are ripe for plunder.\r  There's no telling\r what we're flying into.\r  Let's find out. Take us down.\r  There it is. Reklam Station.\r  Chopper, get a count on those bombers.\r  (SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE)\r  EZRA: There!\r Y-wing light bombers.\r  Looks like they're\r in decent shape, too.\r  Yeah, but according to Chopper's scan,\r there's only 15 left.\r  Correction.\r There are only 14 left.\r  Looks like they're being destroyed.\r  We need to move in now.\r  There won't\r be any ships left if we wait.\r  Hold on. Our orders are to recon\r the station, not go after ships.\r  We should advise Captain Syndulla.\r  What if the Empire\r detects our transmission?\r  I was given command of this assignment.\r  I know what the objective was\r  and I am changing it.\r  We're going in now.\r That's an order.\r  Yes, sir.\r  Hurry! We're losing ships.\r  Well, Lieutenant, what's your\r plan to get 'em out of there?\r  - Here's what we're gonna do\r - Look out!\r  What was that?\r  Oh, right, right. That is\r probably a dismantler droid.\r  Forgot that Terba said there might\r be some guarding the station.\r  When were you gonna\r share that information?\r  Well, of course I just did.\r  Commander Titus,\r we have a perimeter breach.\r  Dismantler droids have been activated.\r  It could be the rebels Governor\r Pryce warned us about.\r  (WARBLING)\r  Chop, get it!\r  (SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE)\r  (CHUCKLING)\r  Right, I'll handle those clankers.\r  - Hold on tight!\r - Where are you going?\r  Outside.\r  (WARBLING)\r  (GRUNTS)\r  (ENGINE SPUTTERING)\r  We're going down!\r  (ALARM BEEPING)\r  Chopper, get the engines back online!\r  (SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE)\r  The rebel ship has suffered\r considerable damage.\r  They've lost power.\r  Where'd they go?\r  We've lost them in the storm, sir.\r  Bye-bye.\r  Brace yourselves! I'm gonna\r lock onto the station.\r  Sir, the rebel ship is not\r registering on our scanners.\r  It may have crashed onto the surface.\r  Alert the Imperial sector fleet.\r  Governor Pryce will want\r to know of this.\r  We gotta shut down the conveyor\r before they're all slagged.

Their tanks will be empty.\r  Bet you didn't think of that\r when we walked into this.\r  Not the first complication. Won't\r be the last. Let's get to work.\r  You know, Kanan would've\r loved this mission.\r  KANAN: So, tell me,\r how do I restore my sight?\r  You must be empty.\r  There is only the Force.\r  Now, turn and walk forward.\r  I'm not sure this is such a good idea.\r  And why not?\r  Because those spiders\r are out there, waiting.\r  How do you know this?\r  (SIGHS) I hear them.\r  Good. Keep walking.\r  Sound relates them to you.\r What else?\r  I can feel them in the ground,\r  their vibrations when they move.\r  Indeed, you are perceptive.\r  Are they close?\r  No.\r  Continue on then.\r  How else do you relate to the spiders?\r  Before, in the caves, a foul smell.\r  It was old, decayed.\r  Ah, a fascinating description.\r  You see much for being blind.\r  Well, I know what they look like.\r  I saw them when I had my sight.\r  Then picture them in your mind.\r  Are they close?\r  - No.\r - Are you certain?\r  (HISSING)\r  What should I do?\r  What do you want to do? Hmm?\r  Run.\r  (SIGHS)\r  But there's another one\r right behind me.\r  You are beginning to see. Ha!\r  Now, be empty and continue onward.\r  Why aren't they attacking?\r  It is not in their nature.\r  Well, it has been, in my experience.\r  Because you do not see them.\r  - You mean, see them for what they are?\r - Look closer.\r  Hmm. There's nothing.\r I can't sense them.\r  Look within.\r  I see\r  Fear.\r  In the spiders?\r  Ezra!\r  Ah, your thoughts dwell\r on your apprentice.\r  He's in danger.\r  (HISSING)\r  No!\r  No. It's not\r Ezra or the spiders.\r  It's It's me.\r  Fear, grief, anger,\r that's how they see me.\r  (SIGHS)\r  That's how I see myself.\r  Ah, your sight returns.\r  (CHUCKLES)\r  I distanced myself from everyone.\r  From the Force too.\r  Your connection to the Force allows\r you to see in ways others cannot.\r  If you can see yourself,\r  you will never be truly blind,\r  Kanan Jarrus, Jedi Knight.\r  I understand.\r  Where are you going?\r  Ezra needs me. They all do.\r  What of the spiders?\r  (CHUCKLES) I can see them,\r so there's nothing to fear.\r  And what of this, hmm?\r  Keep it, as a gift.\r  Oh.\r  (CHUCKLING)\r  (WHIRRING)\r  SABINE: Last two, and\r then we're outta here.\r  Sir, the rebels, they're alive\r  and they're trying\r to refuel the old bombers.\r  Get a squad down there.\r  Override the conveyor and\r activate the magnetic locks.\r  Ugh. Well, they know we're here.\r  They're locking the ships down.\r  Uh, perhaps my associates can assist?\r  (CONVERSING IN UGNESE)\r  (SIGHS) My friend says all systems have\r been overridden by the control tower.\r  (SIGHS) Zeb, you and\r Sabine finish refueling.\r  I'll take care of the tower.\r  Rex, you're with me.\r  (SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE)\r  Stop your complaining.

Still in\r the Yarma system, Hera.\r  Yeah, no.\r Getting some great recon.\r  So busy. No time to talk.\r Bridger out.\r  It appears Commander Bridger's\r recon mission\r  has turned into a recovery operation.\r  - Sir, we had better mobilize the fleet.\r - Indeed.\r  Kanan?\r  Ezra's in trouble. Let's go.\r  (SIGHS) It's good to have you back.\r  Oh! You want some more, you lousy clanker?\r I'll show you more!\r  (GRUNTING)\r  That tears it!\r  Get off!\r  (SHRIEKS)\r  - Rex!\r - Rex!\r  Partner! I will stay here\r and guard the shuttle\r  in case we need a quick escape.\r  You do that.\r  I assure you, Governor, we will\r capture these rebels momentarily.\r  I hope so, Titus,\r  but know I will be there\r soon to reinforce you.\r  - You?\r - You?\r  Last time we met, you were captain\r of a top-secret Star Destroyer.\r  Now you run a junkyard?\r  Your capture and execution will mean\r my return to ranking status.\r  Yeah, get ready for another demotion.\r  I'm asking nicely.\r Unlock those bombers now.\r  Sorry, but I've sabotaged\r the control unit.\r  The only way to unlock the bombers is\r to cut power to the entire station.\r  - Okay.\r - Wait!\r  If you disable the power, this station\r will drop to a fiery destruction.\r  You would doom us and your\r friends for a few old ships?\r  I believe in my friends.\r They'll be fine.\r  You, not so much.\r  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)\r  Better get going.\r  Evacuate now!\r  The bombers are unlocked.\r  Spectre-5 to Spectre-6.\r What was that blast?\r  EZRA: I had to cut\r the station's power.\r  Get in those bombers\r and get out of here!\r  What about you?\r  EZRA: I'll take the Phantom.\r  Now get going. That's an order!\r  Chopper, tap into the\r relay navigation system.\r  I need you to remote-pilot\r those four ships.\r  (SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE)\r  Yes, you're getting\r in a Y-wing too.\r  (COMPLAINING IN DROID LANGUAGE)\r  Zeb!\r  - Come on!

Commander Sato,\r everyone is accounted for.\r  Get us out of here!\r  (BEEPING)\r  I'm sorry. Okay? I messed up.\r  As a leader, you've a\r responsibility to Phoenix Squadron.\r  You almost got your team\r and yourself killed.\r  - And\r - I know.\r  Okay? The Phantom is gone.\r  But we're back in one piece\r and we've got five new\r  Uh, or old bombers.\r  You disobeyed orders.\r  I have no choice but\r to suspend your command.\r  You suspend him, you\r should suspend all of us.\r  We went along with him.\r  Your loyalty is admirable, Zeb,\r  but this was Ezra's mission, not yours.\r  At least we got the Y-wings?\r  They're not for us.\r  We have orders to deliver these\r bombers to General Dodonna's unit.\r  They're part of a wider rebellion\r we're working to build.\r  It's growing every day.\r  Well, I guess if we're going\r to defeat the Empire,\r  we'll need all the help we can get.\r  I should have told you\r I was using the Sith holocron.\r  I wanted to believe it could help us.\r  Well, we don't need that thing.\r  We'll find another way.\r  Um, what'd you do with it anyway?\r  (CHUCKLES)\r  It's safe.\r  Ah.\r  Oh, um, one more thing.\r  I wanted to thank you for coming back.\r  I'll always come back.\r  I know.\r      \n                "}, "A Princess on Lothal": {"episode": "s02e10", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tHow's he taking it?\r  As you'd expect.\r  We both knew Ezra might not get the news\r he hoped he would about his parents.\r  Governor Azadi, we're grateful\r you stood by them for so long.\r  Not sure\r what good it did.\r  Things don't seem any better\r here on Lothal.\r  At the moment, maybe, but we hope\r to change that in the future.\r  Speaking of which, Senator Organa\r heard about our losses on Garel.\r  He's sending us reinforcements.\r  His agent is coming to\r Lothal with three cruisers.\r  Three cruisers? That is good news.\r  Maybe a mission like this\r is just what Ezra needs.\r  I hope you're right. We'll be\r there as soon as we can to help.\r  Sir, three unidentified starships\r have just entered our sector.\r  Launch fighters to intercept.\r  Open a channel.\r  Attention.

End transmission.\r  Well, there's no turning back now.\r   Ezra, we're gonna miss\r our rendezvous. Let's go.\r  If you're going into\r Jalath City, be careful.\r  The fleet may be gone, but Imperial\r security is bound to recognize you.\r  Maybe dressed like this.\r  But who's gonna notice an\r extra stormtrooper and cadet?\r  Great.\r  They know our ship, too.\r Ryder, any chance we could\r  Borrow my bike? Take it.\r  But I'm not getting involved any further.\r  Even after what the Empire did to you?\r  Come on, get back in the fight.\r  I won't go back to prison, Kanan.\r  Please don't ask that of me.\r  Those are our reinforcements?\r Some old transports?\r  In our position, you\r take what you can get, kid.\r  Hey, excuse me, miss.\r Uh, where's your commander?\r  Not much of\r a welcoming committee.\r  Trooper?\r  I'm Kanan. This is Ezra.\r We're from Phoenix Squadron.\r  I know who you are.\r  And unless you want\r the deck officer to know, too,\r  I suggest you put your helmets\r back on and keep your mouths shut.\r  Excuse me?\r  You heard her. Shut it.\r  Deck Officer, I'd like to start\r distributing my relief aid.\r  Stand by. My orders are to inspect\r the cargo for contraband,\r  and detain these vessels\r until the lieutenant arrives.\r  Scanning crew, move out.\r  Well, this plan's off\r to a good start.\r  As a matter of fact,\r it's going perfectly.\r  - Where's the rest of your team?\r - They'll be here, eventually.\r  Good. Then you can\r steal my ships.\r  - What?\r - What?\r  I'll explain later. First I have\r to deal with the lieutenant.\r  - Follow my lead and try and keep up.\r - Wait.\r  Why does she get to give orders?\r I don't get to give orders.\r  Do you ever listen to yourself?\r  Yes, and I happen to be\r very interesting.\r  You must be Leia Organa, princess\r of the royal house of Alderaan.\r  And aide to my father,\r Senator Bail Organa.\r  I come with relief supplies\r for Lothal's needy,\r  who are suffering terribly as a\r result of the rebel insurgency here.\r  Surely you don't want\r innocents to starve.\r  No, of course not.\r  Lothal has indeed suffered,\r as has Alderaan.\r  From what I hear,\r  your ships have an unfortunate\r habit of falling into rebel hands.\r  I assure you, that won't\r happen on my watch.\r  What's that?\r  Gravity locks? This is hardly necessary.\r  I insist.\r  Plus a trooper detachment,\r and for extra security\r  Walkers will guard your ships\r from the rebel insurgency.\r  - All for your safety, miss.\r - It's \"Your Highness.\"\r  As my ships are detained, I will\r require your shuttle to begin my work.\r  Oh?\r Um, my shuttle?\r  Certainly I could arrange\r for other transportation.\r  No. Your shuttle. I need\r to leave immediately.\r  You two, bring those supplies and\r escort me to the trauma area at once.\r  Yes, ma'am. Right away.\r  I hate to say it, but whoever\r came up with this plan\r  severely underestimated\r the Empire's security.\r  - I'm sorry.\r - Don't be.\r  It's not your fault.\r  Yes, it is. This was my plan.\r  We need those ships.\r  Why didn't you just hand them\r off to us in deep space?\r  You don't understand.\r It's not that simple.\r  If the Empire could prove Alderaan\r provided ships to the rebels,\r  we'd lose our seat in the Senate\r and be charged with treason.\r  But if they're stolen on a planet\r controlled by the Empire\r  Alderaan would be blameless.\r  Have to admit, that was a good plan.\r  Well, now we need a new one.\r  Yeah, what is it, Chopper?\r  Stormtroopers?\r  Friends of yours?\r  Not for much longer,\r by the look of things.\r  What are we going to do?\r  This time,\r you follow my lead.\r  This is a secure site.\r State your business.\r  I'm taking the princess ambassador\r here on a scouting mission\r  for possible refugee relocation.\r  This is not a safe area for you.\r  There's a high level of rebel\r activity happening at the moment.\r  Well, we're finishing our survey.\r  We could take these prisoners\r back to Jalath for you.\r  That won't be necessary. We have orders\r to terminate one of them immediately.\r  Hold on, trooper. As a\r representative of the Senate,\r  I demand to know\r what this man has done.\r  He's a fugitive from an Imperial prison.\r  Now, depart immediately\r for your own safety.\r  Where you find one rebel,\r there are usually more.\r  Chopper's receiving a signal.\r  You know what that means.\r Hera's here.\r  - More friends of yours?\r - Yeah, I'm a likable guy.\r  You're coming with me!\r  No, you can't come on board!\r  You have to go get the Phantom.\r Get moving!\r  Your friends might shoot you\r wearing that armor.\r  That's not a bad idea, Governor.\r  - Take the princess hostage.\r - What?\r  If I'm seen escaping with you,\r I'll be labeled a traitor.\r  You have to take me prisoner.\r  Well, you better make it look good.\r I'll warn Sabine.\r  - We got two incoming.\r - What about Ezra and Kanan?\r  They're the troopers on the left.\r  Help! Help! Commander!\r  Hold your fire! She's my responsibility!\r I'll get her back!\r  Kanan's coming. He said\r to make it look good.\r  - No, Zeb, wait! Easy!\r - That's Kanan!\r  I know.\r  They're taking prisoners?\r They do that now?\r  Kanan. Wake up!\r  Kanan! How's your face?\r  Why did you hit me?\r  What? You had a helmet on.\r  - Did you have to hit us so hard?\r - Hey, you wanted it to look good.\r  Where's the princess?\r  In the cockpit\r with Hera.\r  We've completed our search of the\r transports and found no contraband.\r  Very well, Corporal.\r  Yes?\r  Sir, my squad\r was ambushed by rebels.\r  They escaped with\r the fugitive Ryder Azadi.\r  - What?\r - They also abducted a cadet.\r  And some princess ambassador.\r  She's under our protection.\r  Deploy search patrols, now!\r  I owe you my life.\r You have my gratitude.\r  It's the least we could do after\r leading the Empire right to you.\r  We heard what happened. Sorry, kid.\r  Hey, at least\r now you know.\r  Yeah. I guess\r I just need some time.\r  - Is he all right?\r - He's okay.\r  He just lost some people\r close to him.\r  It's a challenge being his age\r with so much responsibility.\r  I know that feeling.\r  Maybe he could use a friend.\r  I know who you are.\r  You're Ezra Bridger.\r  I heard your transmission.\r  Yeah?\r My parents heard it, too.\r  But they're gone now.\r  I'm sorry.\r  It's just there's so much against us.\r  Do you ever wonder\r  If this fight is even worth it?\r  Every day.\r  - But I'm still here.\r - But you're a princess.\r  You don't have to risk\r your life doing this.\r  I feel like because I can fight,\r I have to for those who cannot.\r  And I think you might\r be the same way.\r  Let's figure out a way\r to get your ships.\r  We did a scan of the landing field,\r and looking at the Imperial security,\r  I just don't see us living long\r enough to get near those ships.\r  Two walkers are a big problem.\r  Ugh. Even if we\r reach the ships,\r  they're not going anywhere until we\r can disable those gravity locks.\r  Those defenses are formidable.\r  Why?\r  Because the Empire\r doesn't underestimate you.\r  They know how good you are.\r  We might be able to get one out,\r but we'll never get all three.\r  It's impossible.\r  I know you need those ships, so don't\r tell me why we can't get them.\r  Tell me how we will.\r  Well, Kanan and I still\r have our disguises,\r  so we can get onto the platform.\r  But to get close to the ships,\r we'll need a distraction.\r  - I can handle that. \r - The Ghost  can act as air support.\r  And I can use detonators to\r blast off the gravity locks.\r  Won't work. You can't\r forcibly remove the locks.\r  You know this how?\r  In prison I put\r those locks together,\r  so I know how to take 'em apart.\r  Ryder Azadi, does that mean\r you're getting involved?\r  Just this once.\r  It's clear\r I can't stay on Lothal,\r  so I'll help you,\r if you get me outta here.\r  Over there.\r  This is the rebel ship\r we've been looking for.\r  Set weapons for stun.\r  I'd think you'd be pleased to see\r me safe and sound, Lieutenant.\r  Of course, Your Highness. Very pleased.\r  Just, um, surprised.\r  We need to cut open\r that access panel,\r  and bypass the primary\r power flux coupling.\r  Hurry.\r  This brave trooper saved\r us both from those rebels.\r  He deserves a medal.\r  He did it!\r Sabine, you take this one.\r  We'll move on to the next ship.\r  I'll call in the air support.\r  As you can see, your ships are safe\r and sound right where you left them.\r  If you're trying to\r impress me, Lieutenant,\r  you're doing a miserable job of it.\r  - What do you mean?\r - You don't know?\r  I didn't authorize this!\r Who's piloting that ship?\r  - Sir! Rebels!\r - Blast them!\r  Whoa!\r  Sabine's away.\r  Let's get outta here.\r  I'm not sure we're going anywhere.\r  Secure the third ship.\r I'll handle the walker.\r  Handle the walker? How?\r  Just trust us. Go!\r  Unlock that ship!\r  He's a Jedi!\r  Look! What's that?\r  I don't think he's on our side.\r  Whoa!\r  Did you see that?\r  If you like that, watch this.\r  Drop your weapons.\r  Oh!\r  - Get down!\r - Whoa!\r  That is impressive.\r  Well, mostly.\r  She's all yours, Kanan.\r  Two down, one to go.\r  I'll handle this.\r  Thank goodness you've arrived.\r  The rebels are stealing my ships.\r  AT-AT 36, you have new\r orders, shoot to kill.\r  - Repeat, shoot to kill.\r - No, you can't!\r  I'm sorry, Your Highness. We can't let\r your ships fall into rebel hands.\r  Destroy that ship now!\r  Did I get it this time?\r  Finish up here. I have to help them.\r  Uh-oh.\r  Uh-oh.\r  Time for me to go.\r  - Wait. What are you doing?\r - Stop that rebel!\r  He's stealing my transport!\r  Make it look good.\r  Oh, we gotta\r make this look good.\r  - You have my permission.\r - See ya later, Princess.\r  The princess!\r  My ships. You lost my ships.\r  I'm afraid so.\r  You should be afraid!\r  Just wait until I tell the Senate\r  that the Imperial presence on Lothal\r is helpless against the rebels.\r  No, no, no. That won't be necessary.\r  I-I assure you, Alderaan will be fully\r compensated for your lost ships.\r  Fine.\r  Oh, and I'll need your shuttle\r so I can return home.\r  My shuttle. Right.\r  Uh, where is it?\r  Lieutenant, did you\r lose your ship, too?\r  I'll summon you another right away.\r  So, Governor, we need to\r find a safe place for you.\r  I already know where\r I'm going, back home.\r  I knew you'd come around.\r  I couldn't see it before,\r  but going to prison with the\r Bridgers started something.\r  That something has grown\r bigger than I ever imagined.\r  I owe it to them and I owe it to\r you to see it through to the end.\r  Welcome back to the fight, Governor.\r      \n                "}, "Iron Squadron": {"episode": "s03e07", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tHey, did Fulcrum say how long it'd be\r before the Empire invades Mykapo?\r  No, but Commander Sato\r has connections here,\r  and he said rebel sympathizers\r were eager to evacuate.\r  I think we may be too late.\r  (CANNONS FIRING)\r  Imperial transport plus four TIEs.\r  They haven't spotted us yet.\r  They're distracted.

I can explain.\r - Explain what?\r  Hera, Sabine, Ezra.\r  This is Lando Calrissian.\r He needs a fast ship\r  to move some cargo past the\r Imperial blockade of Lothal.\r  Yes. For some reason, this planet has\r an unusually large Imperial presence.\r  But are you sure you can get\r this vessel past the blockade,\r  - Captain Hera, is it?\r - It is.\r  And the Ghost can mask\r both its signal and signature.\r  We'll get you past the blockade.\r  - What's the cargo?\r - I was told \"No questions asked.\"\r  That's fine.\r It just costs more.\r  Kanan and I already settled on a price.\r  But I assume he requires your approval.\r  - He doesn't.\r - Excellent.\r  When the job's done,\r you'll be paid handsomely,\r  - and, as agreed, I'll return your droid.\r - Return our droid?\r  Uh, yeah. Funny story.\r  You see, Lando and I\r were playing sabacc,\r  and I kinda bet Chopper.\r  Garazeb Orrelios,\r Chopper wasn't yours to bet!\r  - Kanan said it was okay.\r - And you should know better!\r  Chopper is a member of this crew!\r  Whoa, whoa, whoa.\r We should go.\r  I need to pick up my cargo, and I\r don't want to keep my supplier waiting.\r  Besides, if all goes well,\r  there won't be anything for\r you good people to argue about.\r  Oh, you're quite the pilot.\r  That's the smoothest takeoff\r I've had in years.\r  And you're quite the\r smooth-talking smuggler.\r  \"Smuggler\"?\r Such a small word.\r  I'm more of a\r galactic entrepreneur.\r  - That means businessperson.\r - I know what it means.\r  Chopper, I need you to\r fix the signature modulator\r  so we can get past the blockade.\r  Chopper's right. He's no\r longer a part of the crew.\r  He doesn't have to do\r what you tell him anymore.\r  I can see you have\r some things to work out.\r  I wonder, my new friend,\r  if you'd be kind enough to give\r me a tour of this fine ship.\r  Why, thank you, Chopper.\r  Can't believe the little bolt\r bucket's actually waiting on that guy.\r  I can't believe you lost Chopper.\r  Good thing I wasn't there.\r You'd have bet me.\r  Mmm, nah. You wouldn't\r have covered the pot.\r  Besides, I think Calrissian cheated.\r  You're just a sore loser.\r Lando seems nice enough.\r  I'm telling you,\r I don't like that guy.\r  Sabine. I understand\r this is your work.\r  Reminds me of Janyor's\r protest paintings on Bith.\r  Janyor of Bith is a major influence.\r  Well, your work is even more\r stunning in its simplicity.\r  Hey, I told you your stuff\r was good months ago.\r  Yeah, but you didn't know why.\r  Oh, milady, that's hardly fair.\r  He's just a child with no\r experience of the galaxy.\r  I, um I don't suppose you'd like\r to see my more impressionistic pieces?\r  I happen to be an\r impressionistic connoisseur.\r  - That means\r - I know what it means.\r  - Hey, what does that mean?\r - A lot less than he thinks.\r  I don't like that guy.\r  Merchant-One, this is Calrissian.\r  Requesting permission to dock.\r  You have the goods?\r  Always.\r  Ah, then permission granted.\r  Now, whatever I say,\r just play along.\r  Wait.\r What does that mean?\r  I hope you have a backup plan\r in case something goes wrong.\r  No fear, Captain. If a comet\r hits, this ship has escape pods.\r  That's not exactly the kind\r of \"wrong\" I had in mind.\r  Good to see you again, Azmorigan.\r  I have what you ordered.\r  Mmm, mmm. What do you\r have to offer in return?\r  - Her name is Hera.\r - What?\r  - You can't do this!\r - Trust me.\r  - Hera!\r - A deal's a deal, Kanan.\r  Well, her attire is, uh, preposterous,\r  but the trade is, uh, mmm\r is acceptable.\r  Thank you, Lord Calrissian, for\r delivering me to my new master.\r  - I must find a way to repay you.\r - Please don't let it concern you.\r  Enough prattle.\r Eh, you disturb my supper.\r  Uh, take your cargo and go.\r  As always, Azmorigan, a pleasure\r doing business with you.\r  - Where's Hera?\r - Tell her about Hera, Lando.\r  Hera is following the plan,\r  which is what we should be doing\r if we want to get her back.\r  - Where's Hera?\r - What plan is she following?\r  - I told her to take an escape pod.\r - You never told her that.\r  I did, actually.\r Weren't you paying attention?\r  Besides, Hera strikes\r me as very capable.\r  - We are lucky to have a captain like her.\r - I know that.\r  Wait.\r What do you mean, \"we\"?\r  Quite a day you're having.\r First, you lose Chopper, now Hera.\r  - What's in here?\r - Sophisticated mining equipment.\r  Uh, sounds like your sophisticated\r mining equipment is snoring.\r  Just don't open the box.\r And whatever you do, keep it calm.\r  Ah.\r  - You need food?\r - I seem to have lost my appetite.\r  But perhaps you'd like me\r to serve you.\r  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\r  Good practice for you.\r Uh, serve me, serve me.\r  Be quick about it.\r  And perhaps you'd prefer to dine alone?\r  Mmm. Oh, yes.\r  Go, go. Leave us.\r  Beat it!\r  - Take the whole tray.\r - What are you talking about?\r  The master desires\r a little more alone time\r  while I change clothes in my quarters.\r  That was a really useful tray.\r  That Twi'lek's my property,\r  and I want my property\r back here now!\r  In a pod, as discussed.\r  You really should have\r more faith in our captain.\r  - Our captain?\r - Um, we'll go prep the airlock.\r  Kanan, Hera's aboard.\r  We should probably\r make ourselves scarce.\r  Somebody should.\r  You played that perfectly.\r Thank you.\r  Oh, you're welcome.\r  I deserved that.\r  But can we get back\r to the job at hand\r  flying us past the Imperial blockade?\r  Otherwise, I don't have to pay\r you or give your droid back.\r  - What was in that crate?\r - Come on. I'll show you.\r  Calrissian said not to open it.\r  Yes. He did.\r  Uh, kinda cute, whatever it is.\r  Catch it!\r  That's what was in the crate.\r  Grab that puffer-pig,\r but don't scare her.\r  - Got her!\r - You're scaring her!\r  - I told you not to scare her.\r - I'm not scaring her!\r  Karabast!\r  - Whoa.\r - Whoa!\r  - You see? You scared her.\r - What is going on out here?\r  - It's a, um, puffer\r - I don't want to know.\r  We've reached the blockade.\r  I could really use Hera on this\r side of the pig right about now.\r  Yeah, I don't see that happening.\r  Any idea what the Imperials are\r hoping to find with this blockade?\r  - Rebels?\r - Besides that.\r  Unauthorized mining\r equipment, perhaps.\r  And why would they be looking for that?\r  Maybe because I tried\r smuggling some here a week ago.\r  Don't worry.\r  The Imperials are scanning\r for equipment, machinery.\r  But our girl here is 100% organic.\r  Their scanners won't detect her,\r  so long as your ship\r can mask its signature.\r  You know it can't until\r you ask Chopper to fix it.\r  You're catching on.\r All right, my little friend.\r  Would you like to be\r a hero and fix it for me?\r  Admiral.\r  This Corellian ship\r matches the description\r  of the rebel craft\r we've been looking for.\r  Okay, signature modulator's\r back online.\r  And just in time.\r  No. Its signature reads\r the freighter Tontine,\r  authorized for travel\r between Boz Pity and Lothal.\r  Tontine, prepare for scanning.\r  Sabine, once we get back to Lothal,\r  I'd love to purchase some of your art.\r  Really? My work.\r You'd pay?\r  Oh, he'll pay.\r  Scans clear, Tontine.\r You may proceed.\r  We're gonna make it!\r  Kid, not a good\r  idea.\r  The signature was masked.\r That's the rebel ship!\r  All ships open fire!\r  Uh, Kanan, when they shoot at us,\r Hera usually shoots back.\r  Yeah, well, I'm not Hera,\r  and I'm having enough trouble\r just keeping ahead of these guys.\r  - Cloud cover!\r - What?\r  - Find some.\r - Oh. Right.\r  Good call, Hera.\r I think we're in the clear.\r  You know, your job's\r a lot harder than it looks.\r  Nice. He finally appreciates you.\r  All right. Enough with\r the divide and conquer.\r  You think by setting us\r against each other,\r  you'll keep us off-balance\r enough to get what you want?\r  But what you want depends on my\r crew working together in sync.\r  - Is that clear?\r - As crystal, Captain.\r  A little help?\r  This time, try to keep it calm.\r  We don't want you inflating it again.\r  - Hey, it wasn't my fault.\r - It's your face's fault.\r  This is your land?\r  Bought if off a charming\r fellow named Vizago.\r  Perfect. But why was it so\r important to get this pig here?\r  Because a puffer-pig has a nose\r for precious minerals.\r  It can do the job\r of a dozen mining scanners.\r  And the Empire doesn't want\r private landholders mining Lothal.\r  We're done here.\r Pay us, and we'll be on our way.\r  He has other debts to pay.\r  Azmorigan?\r  Did you forget I introduced\r you to Vizago, huh?\r  I knew where you were headed.\r  But your ship You couldn't\r have hidden it anywhere close.\r  Did you walk here?\r You don't walk anywhere.\r  Well, I do what's necessary\r  to claim my property, Calrissian.\r  - What do you want?\r - My demands are simple.\r  I want my pig back\r and you.\r  Plus this ship and this crew as\r compensation for my sore feet.\r  But first first,\r I want to bury Calrissian.\r  Yeah, yeah, I understand the feeling.\r  - But no.\r - Now, wait.\r  Let's consider that\r last demand for a sec.\r  I've run out of patience!\r Get them!\r  Get back!\r  Chopper, don't hide there!\r It's a fuel canister!\r  - No lightsabers, not unless we're\r - You worry too much.\r  Hey, mine doesn't do that.\r  Nope. I might not be able to\r sword fight yet, but I can shoot.\r  Kid, you continue to impress.\r  - Nice shot, Lando!\r - Yeah, just not as much as Lando.\r  Zeb. The pig! Scare it!\r  - What? How?\r - Just be you.\r  Hey, pig!\r  You're welcome!\r  New terms: I get Calrissian,\r and this one lives.\r  I get Calrissian,\r and you all can go free.\r  - You got it.\r - Deal.\r  It's tempting,\r but the answer's still \"no.\"\r  Whoa!\r  My terms: You and your men\r leave now, and we let you live.\r  Start walking.\r  I like everything that just happened\r except that you let Azmorigan live.\r  That'll be a problem for me later.\r  I think you have a problem now.\r  You don't have the credits you owe\r us, do you?

We shall meet again.\r  Oh, come on.\r I saved your circuits.\r  Isn't that apology enough?\r  So that's it? We just walk\r away without the creds?\r  - Well, we got Chopper back.\r - I'm looking for a positive here.\r  There are a lot of things we\r couldn't accomplish without him.\r  You should appreciate that more.\r  - I always appreciated you, Sabine.\r - Yes, Ezra, I know.\r  Course, we still need food and fuel.\r  Oh, hey, Chopper\r stole Lando's fuel!\r  You mean he was playing\r Lando the whole time?\r  Good job, Chopper.\r  Anyone that fools\r Lando is okay with me.\r  Of course I knew they took the fuel.\r That's why I didn't pay them.\r  A gambler never shows his cards.\r  Till we meet again!\r      \n                "}, "Twilight of the Apprentice: Part II": {"episode": "s02e20", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tOnce we drop out of hyperspace,\r we'll be going dark.\r  - Are you sure about this?\r - Yes.\r  Ahsoka, you don't have\r to go to Malachor alone.\r  - I could be there in two rotations.\r - I'm not alone, Rex.\r  You know, I could have ordered\r you to take me along.\r  You don't exactly outrank me anymore.\r  In my book, experience\r outranks everything.\r  Hmm, then I definitely outrank you.\r  May the Force be with you.\r  Why is Rex so worried?

Go, go!\r  No!\r  Sabine, run!\r  Ezra!\r  Such a noble act.\r Just like a Jedi.\r  I'm learning.\r  But not quite enough.\r  - I'm surprised to see you here.\r - The kill is mine.\r  You are short-sighted. We will use the\r boy as bait to draw in the others.\r  - Now find the girl.\r - No!\r  You and I are\r gonna have a talk.\r  And if you're good, maybe some\r of your friends will survive.\r  Zeb!\r  Zeb!\r  I don't wanna die this way.\r I'm the last of my kind.\r  What's going on?\r I heard blasts.\r  They've got Ezra.\r  - Who's got Ezra?\r - Inquisitors. Two of them.\r  One was bad enough.\r We need to get Kanan.\r  No. If we send a signal, we\r could compromise the fleet.\r  We have to try and\r save Ezra ourselves.\r  How are we\r supposed to do that?\r  I'm working on it.\r  You handle a lightsaber\r well, apprentice.\r  Well, I've got some time,\r if you wanted a lesson.\r  You have great potential, but perhaps\r it is I that might teach you,\r  as your master never achieved the\r rank of Jedi Knight. Did he?\r  Maybe not, but he took\r out the last Inquisitor.\r  So I think I'll\r just stick with him.\r  Yes, the death of the Grand\r Inquisitor was a surprise to all.\r  Yet, it does present the rest\r of us with new opportunities.\r  There are many hunting you now, all\r intent on killing you and your master.\r  Does that frighten you?\r  If you were gonna kill me,\r you'd have already done it.\r  Kill you? I have no\r plans to kill you.\r  Yet.\r  Your fear betrays you.\r  Come on.\r  It's not working!\r  Run!\r  The other is yours.\r Do as you will.\r  Oh.\r  Oh. Now I find\r the supplies.\r  Why can you just\r not cooperate?\r  Why do you compel\r me to inflict pain?\r  You know we'll find the others, so\r why not just tell me where they are?\r  Because unlike you, I can shut up.\r You're like a broken protocol droid.\r  Shh.\r  Hmm. You hide\r your fear well.\r  Poor child. If only you had the\r power to protect your friends.\r  Shows what you know. I'm growing\r more powerful every day.\r  Unfortunate there's no one left\r to train you. The Jedi of old are dead.\r  Not all of 'em.\r  We know about Ahsoka Tano.\r  Who's Ahsoka Tano?\r  As pretty as you are\r  What?\r  I only need you alive. That\r doesn't mean in one piece.\r  Now, where's\r Ahsoka Tano?\r  Chopper! What'd\r they do to you?\r  You know I don't understand\r what you're saying.\r  Ah! Just come with me.\r I need your help.\r  Will you just be quiet?\r  I need your help.\r  - What has the boy revealed?\r - Nothing I wish to share.\r  Contact your rebel friends and\r bring them here. That's all I ask.\r  Let me think\r about that. Uh, no.\r  Contact your friends.\r  I'm not talking to you right now.\r Sabine, where's Zeb?\r  We tried to fight, but\r Zeb never had a chance.\r  - What are you saying?\r - Your friend is dead.\r  You are mocking me, right?\r  I can never tell. Everyone seems\r to know everything these days.\r  Truth is, I don't really stand\r a chance going in alone,\r  much less with you.\r  If we leave this space station, we\r will never see those kids again.\r  I came here with them, and I'm\r not leaving without them.\r  Hello, Spectre-6, come in.\r  Uh, do you read?\r This is Commander Meiloorun.\r  Answer him.\r  Uh, Commander Meiloorun.\r Yes. Yes, I can hear you.\r  You\r missed your check-in.\r  Am I correct in assuming mechanical\r difficulties have your craft stranded again,\r  and you're in need\r of help with repairs?\r  Answer him.\r  Commander, we, uh, we can handle everything.\r No need for you or the others.\r  No, Commander.\r We changed our mind.\r  We could use some help. Bring Kanan,\r and you better bring Ahsoka too.\r  Very well.\r Meet you in Bay Six.\r  And don't worry.\r  We'll fix everything. Just keep\r your chin up and it'll all be fine.\r  Once we have the others,\r we'll dispose of them both.\r  Very slowly.\r  Chin up. Chin up?\r What does that mean?\r  Oh.\r  What?\r  Go!\r  The doors\r are closing!\r  I can't hold them alone!\r  Ah!\r  Go, go! Go, go, go!\r  We made it.\r Good plan, Zeb.\r  Let's not get all emotional.\r It wasn't a big deal.\r  But I did save both of you and got\r some medical supplies by myself.\r  Yeah, you helped\r a little, Chopper.\r  I win.\r  Looks like you can be disciplined\r when you set your mind to it.\r  What? Wait. Are you trying to say\r you're teaching me a lesson?\r  There are many\r ways to find victory.\r  I'm not sure if I like\r you more or less now.\r  Speaking of lack of discipline.\r  Ezra, we need to talk.\r  Yeah, we do, about the two\r Inquisitors we just ran into.\r  Inquisitors?\r  Yes. Two. We got lucky.\r Zeb saved us.\r  Without him, uh, things\r could have been bad.\r  Well done, soldier.\r  It was a group effort. Those\r Inquisitors are nasty business.\r  Kanan, why didn't you tell\r us there were more of 'em?\r  Commander Sato is going to\r need a full report on this.\r  Well, we did get the medical supplies.\r Some of them.\r  Well, that's good news. I'll meet\r you three on the command deck.\r  - Kanan, they knew about Ahsoka.\r - I'll tell her.\r  Did you know there\r was more than one?\r  No, I didn't. Do you\r think Ahsoka knows?\r  I honestly don't know.\r  We really have no idea\r what we're up against.\r      \n                "}, "Fire Across the Galaxy": {"episode": "s01e14", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t Miss me, bucketheads?\r  It's her!\r  Yup, you definitely missed me.\r  We have an intruder on\r the North side, Sector 9.\r  The artist is back.\r Sound the alarm.\r  Sabine's distraction is working.\r  You got a little better.\r  But I got a lot better.\r  That's not one of us!\r  Bye-bye, bucketheads!\r  Not again.\r Everyone, evacuate!\r  1x14 - \"Fire Across the Galaxy\"\r  The transport you stole will get\r us close to the fleet over Mustafar.\r  We know they have Kanan\r on Tarkin's Star Destroyer.\r  And it's surrounded by a\r bunch of other Star Destroyers.\r  Uh, lots more. We'll need a\r distraction to cover our entry.\r  - Sabine?\r - Engine room's here\r  all the power for the ship.\r If we could get inside\r  the docking bay, I could\r rig something, black 'em out.\r  But our transport ship's\r not gonna fit in there.\r  We need something small enough\r to get into that hangar bay.\r  Too bad we blew up\r all the TIEs at that base.\r  Well uh, there is one left.\r But it's not at the base.\r  Uh-uh.\r Uh-uh.\r  Look, this is serious, Zeb.\r  - For Kanan.\r - Fine.\r  What's going on?\r  The TIE we stole a while back,\r we, uh we didn't exactly crash it.\r  - And by \"didn't exactly,\" you mean\r - We didn't crash it.\r  - We kept it. Hidden.\r - You all knew about this?\r  I should be angry. I should yell at\r you for disobeying a direct order.\r  But right now, I'm\r just grateful we got it.\r  Uh, there's a slight problem with it.\r  - What kind of problem?\r - Yeah, what kind of problem?\r  - Okay. Well, this is awful.\r - What? It's some of my best work.\r  - It'll have to do.\r - I thought you were\r  supposed to be the sane one.\r  This whole plan\r is as crazy as those colors.\r  Maybe you're right.\r  Maybe this mission doesn't\r make military sense.\r  But Kanan is family.\r  And we've all lost enough\r family to the Empire.\r  So rescuing him makes sense to me.\r  I-I'm not ordering you\r any of you to come along.\r  But you need to decide now.\r  - In or out?\r - I'm in.\r  I'm in.\r  Karabast. \r I'm in.\r  - But what about that?\r - Eh, no time to fix it.\r  Besides, the Imperials\r will only scan it.\r  - By the time the Imperials see it\r - It'll be too late.\r  Still protecting your precious crew.\r  Quite admirable.\r  But what I want to know\r  is about the other rebels,\r code name, Fulcrum.\r  I know nothing of a larger rebellion.\r  And if I did,\r I'd rather give my life than tell you.\r  So heroic.\r Just like your master.\r  Tell me, Jedi,\r how did you survive Order 66, hmm?\r  It was your Master Billaba who\r laid down her life for yours.\r  Do you remember her last word to you,\r  her last and final\r breath before she died?\r  You do, don't you?\r  You see it in your sleep.\r  You hear her voice when you wake.\r  Tell me, Jedi, what was\r her last word to you?\r  Run.\r  And does your loyal and precious crew\r  know you ran as your master fell,\r  abandoned her and the Jedi Order\r  when they needed you most?\r  What do you think\r your rebels would do\r  if they knew\r their leader was a coward?\r  You're even afraid of your own power.\r  You don't have the courage to wear\r your full saber out in the open.\r  Let me tell you something, Jedi.\r  You're right to be afraid.\r  You couldn't save your master then,\r  and you can't save your followers now.\r  I'll send in our transponder code\r as soon as we know Kanan is there.\r  - Ezra?\r - Well, here goes nothin'.\r  - So, anything?\r - Give him a minute.\r  We don't really have a minute.\r  Ezra, is he there?\r  - He's there. He's alive!\r - Sending codes.\r  Transport Ship 63378\r cleared for docking.\r  We have 10 TIEs inbound with\r reinforcements. Open Bay 5.\r  They bought it.\r Chop, send in Sabine's present.\r  - That's not regulation.\r - I kinda like it.\r  They're here.\r  So predictable.\r  We lost main power. Some kind of\r pulse detonation in Bay 5.\r  Go to auxiliary power.\r  This shouldn't take long.\r Keep the engine running.\r  - These guys will wake up soon.\r - How soon?\r  - Too soon, I reckon.\r - Come on. This way.\r  The Destroyer is down to emergency\r power and life support only.\r  I have been sending an all-clear\r message to the rest of the fleet.\r  As soon as we miss an interval,\r they send reinforcements.\r  And that interval is up now.\r  Uh-oh.\r  Reinforcements already?\r That was fast.\r  Don't worry. On a ship this big,\r it'll take 'em a while to find us.\r  Drop your weapons!\r Hands up!\r  They found us.\r  It's the rebels. This way!\r  Stand back.\r  Pretty clever, kid.\r So what's next?\r  Kanan is down that hall. I just\r cut off our only way to get to him.\r  Might be our only way,\r but it's not yours.\r  Let's go. Let's go.\r  This is Fulcrum. Who is this?\r  Turns out you taught me pretty well.\r  You shouldn't have come here,\r but I'm glad you did.\r  You would've done the same for me.\r In fact, you have.\r  I hope Ezra's found Kanan by now.\r  - Let me borrow that.\r - Yeah, no problem.\r  I never thought of that.\r  At last, a fight that\r might be worthy of my time.\r  No!\r  That was a mistake.\r  Why? Because you have no\r one left to die for you?\r  No.\r Because I have nothing left to fear.\r  The other troopers are waking up.\r  That puts twice as many\r between us and Chopper.\r  I think I have an alternate plan.\r  - All right.\r - Here's part one.\r  - Part two, we go to Bay 5.\r - Huh. Where your masterpiece is.\r  That's got nothing to do with it.\r  Ezra, we're finding another way out.\r  Ezra? Can you hear me?\r  Ezra.\r  Can you hear me?\r Ezra!\r  - Ezra.\r - Ezra. \r  - Ezra!\r - Ezra, are you out there?\r  - I'm here.\r - Do you have Kanan? Is he okay?\r  Yeah.\r I think he's better than okay.\r  You were right.\r I was a coward.\r  But now I know there's\r something stronger than fear\r  far stronger.\r  The Force.\r  Let me show you how strong it is.\r  You have no idea what\r you've unleashed here today.\r  There are some things far\r more frightening than death.\r  Kanan.\r Kanan.\r  - I thought I lost you.\r - I know the feeling.\r  Let's go home.\r  There's damage to the power core.\r The hyperdrive's overheating.\r  We can't hold the ship.\r We need to evacuate, sir.\r  For your safety, we need to leave now.\r  Ezra, we're in the TIE.\r Where are you?\r  On my way. Go!\r  We are not leaving\r without you and Kanan.\r  Will you just listen to the kid?\r  - Don't worry. I've got him.\r - You mean, I've got you.\r  You take care of Zeb and Sabine.\r I'll get him out of here.\r  Trust me.\r  We had to take the TIE that\r has a bull's-eye painted on it!\r  Spectre-3, we're gonna need\r to get out of here fast.\r  Send a signal so we can\r link up for hyperspace.\r  Do you read?\r  Chopper's not answering.\r  - The Inquisitor's TIE.\r - Well, we know he's not gonna use it.\r  You know what, kid?\r You worry me sometimes.\r  I can't believe that bucket\r of bolts abandoned us!\r  - We got your back.\r - Thanks.\r  But without Chopper's transport,\r we're going nowhere fast.\r  We got TIEs closing in.\r  - How many?\r - Too many!\r  We're in a bit of a tight spot.\r  Yeah? Well, these things\r weren't built for three.\r  - I meant out there, not in here!\r - Trying to concentrate!\r  I just want to say it was really\r nice getting to know all of you.\r  Chopper! He came back.\r  Who Who is that?\r  I don't know, but I\r think they're on our side.\r  Kanan, Ezra, dock with\r Chopper's transport\r  so we can make the jump into hyperspace.\r  The rebels have escaped, sir.\r  I owe you all a great debt of gratitude.\r  Even if what you did\r was rash and reckless.\r  You're welcome, dear.\r  If Chopper was in this transport ship,\r then who was flying the Ghost?\r  Hello, my friend.\r It is good to see you again.\r  I don't understand. I met\r you once for a few moments.\r  - I don't even know your name.\r - His name is Senator Bail Organa.\r  And the crews of the blockade runners?\r  Members of other rebel cells.\r  - There are other cells.\r - We're a cell?\r  - Wait. Did you know we were a cell?\r - Um, no.\r  We weren't supposed to meet.\r  That way, if captured, we couldn't\r reveal the other rebels to the Empire.\r  - That was the protocol.\r - The protocol has changed.\r  - Fulcrum.\r - Ahsoka.\r  - My name is Ahsoka Tano.\r - Why did you come here?\r  Because of you and your apprentice,\r  many in this system and\r beyond have heard your message.\r  You gave them hope in\r their darkest times.\r  We didn't want that hope to die.\r  - So what happens now?\r - I don't know.\r  One chapter has closed\r for you, Ezra Bridger.\r  This is a new day,\r a new beginning.\r  We are getting reports\r of unrest all over Lothal.\r  There are whispers from Mustafar.\r  Some people see the Empire\r  - as weak, vulnerable.\r - Not to worry, Agent Kallus.\r  The Emperor has sent\r an alternative solution.\r      \n                "}, "Path of the Jedi": {"episode": "s01e09", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t Ezra.\r Ezra, you in there?\r  Nope.\r No Ezras in here.\r  Hey, Kanan.\r  Sorry I'm late.\r I was with Sabine.\r  So, you gonna invite me in?\r  You didn't knock, so what makes\r you think you need an invite?\r  - I'm sorry.\r - Then you should knock first.\r  Not for that.\r For missing training.\r  It's all the same thing.\r The fact that you don't see it\r  Ezra, when we were on that asteroid,\r  you made a dangerous connection\r through the Force.\r  Now I have to know\r if you are ready.\r  I am ready.\r Wait. Ready for what?\r  For a test, a real challenge\r  one that could determine if\r you're meant to be a Jedi\r  or not.\r  1x09 - \"Path of the Jedi\"\r  But you said I was a Jedi.\r Why else would you be training me ?\r  I never said you were a Jedi.\r  I said you had the potential\r to become one.\r  But you lack discipline, focus.\r  Come on.\r You know how I grew up.\r  I'm not used to all these rules.\r  Kanan, I want to become\r the Jedi you see in me,\r  the one I don't always see in myself.\r  You're lucky I'm not my Master.\r  She'd never let you\r get away with\r  All the things\r you tried to get away with?\r  You want a second chance or not?\r  - I mean, if you want to give me one\r - I'm not giving you anything.\r  - Now go prep the Phantom.\r - As you say, Master.\r  - Ah, I might regret this.\r - You have to do this, Kanan.\r  After what happened on the\r asteroid, you have to help him.\r  - I hope I can.\r - I know you can.\r  So, where are we headed\r for this test?\r  That's what\r you're gonna tell me.\r  When I was your age, there\r were around 10,000 Jedi Knights\r  defending the galaxy.\r Now, we are few.\r  But in those days,\r we had small outposts,\r  temples spread\r throughout the stars.\r  The Empire sought out these temples\r and destroyed many of them, but not all.\r  I want you to meditate, let\r the Force guide you to one of them.\r  - What if I can't find it?\r - That's part of the test.\r  Trust yourself.\r Trust the Force.\r  So, did you\r take this test at my age?\r  It was different for me, Ezra.\r  Everything was different\r back then.\r  All that remains now is the Force.\r  And only my connection to the\r Force can lead me to the temple.\r  He can be taught.\r  There's a massive stone\r with a tunnel, I think\r  and a bright star inside of it.\r  - And it's right here, on Lothal.\r - You sure?\r  I can't give you the coordinates,\r but I can direct us there.\r  I know I can.\r  The stone from my vision.\r  - Autopilot disengaged.\r - You already knew.\r  I checked the holocron\r back in my cabin.\r  And it told you there was\r a Jedi temple on Lothal?\r  The holocron holds\r extensive star maps,\r  but I was as surprised as you\r that there was a temple here.\r  Course, I couldn't be sure this is where\r you were meant to be, but it makes sense.\r  This is your home.\r  You better figure out how we get\r inside. And don't take too long.\r  Remember, the Empire has access\r to all the old Jedi records.\r  They may know about this temple\r and have it under surveillance.\r  Nothing. No sign of an entrance.\r Not even a crack.\r  But I know this is the place.\r I feel it.\r  Seriously, can't you\r give me a hint?\r  Don't look! Listen.\r  Use the Force to hear the stone\r and its story.\r  The stone.\r The temple. It\r  It wants to admit me.\r No. Wait, not me.\r  Us. Master and Padawan.\r Together.\r  Then together it shall be.\r  - Whoa.\r - Don't lose focus.\r  We don't want this thing\r crashing down on us.\r  - You lost focus.\r - Well, dead guys are distracting.\r  In here, you'll have to face your\r worst fears and overcome them.\r  And there's\r no guarantee of success.\r  I have plenty of faith.\r Faith you'll keep me on track.\r  - I'm not going with you.\r - What?\r  - Where are you gonna be?\r - Right here, with them\r  Masters whose Padawans\r never returned.\r  You're putting your life\r in my hands?\r  You put your training in mine.\r  Good luck.\r  Wait. What exactly\r am I looking for?\r  Nothing and everything.\r  - That doesn't help.\r - I know.\r  But that's what my Master told me.\r  Great.\r Should've brought the holocron.\r  Loth-rat, Loth-cat,\r Loth-wolf, run.\r  Pick a path and all is done.\r  Really?\r That's how you're choosing?\r  What happened to\r using the Force?\r  What happened to\r having faith in me?\r  Second thoughts, fortunately.\r Come on.\r  - Kanan! Slow down.\r - I told you.\r  We might not have much time.\r The Empire could\r  Kanan? Kanan!\r  The Inquisitor.\r  I felt a disturbance in the Force\r  the moment the Jedi decided\r to bring you here, Padawan.\r  - No.\r - Now, who dies first?\r  No! I'll die before\r I let you harm the boy.\r  How reasonable.\r  Kanan, no!\r  Kanan\r  So he called himself \"Kanan,\" did he?\r  Well, it hardly matters now.\r Your turn.\r  I'll make you pay.\r I swear you'll pay!\r  Apparently someone's not \r quite ready to become a Jedi\r  and never will be.\r  Whoa!\r  How do you figure the kid's doing?\r  I gotta agree with Chop.\r I don't think Ezra was ready.\r  I don't think we'll be seeing\r him again, which is too bad.\r  Really? 'Cause I'll be happy just\r to get my cabin back to myself.\r  It's too bad because he had skills\r that were useful to our cause.\r  Knew there was a reason\r you were being so nice to him.\r  That's pretty cold, guys.\r  After all, he's just a\r little kid scared, alone.\r  Me? I pity him.\r  Well, look who's here.\r  How long do you think\r he was listening?\r  - Long enough.\r - Eh Nothing personal, kid.\r  No. This isn't you talking.\r  I'm not back on the Ghost.\r I couldn't be.\r  Well, that's just crazy talk.\r  You're standing here, aren't you?\r  No. I'm back in the temple\r  No. No, this isn't real.\r  Ezra. Wait! Help us!\r  No!\r  That's right. I'm in the temple.\r I knew it.\r  Kanan?\r Kanan, where are you?\r  No. He died!\r The Inquisitor killed him!\r  Or Or-Or was that\r an illusion too?\r  Either way, I'm trapped.\r  No way I get this open on my own.\r  I'm alone,\r abandoned again.\r  Again\r  Yeah.\r Been alone before. Survived.\r  I can survive this.\r  Maybe Kanan's not dead.\r Maybe he's just injured.\r  He might need my help in there.\r  How perceptive.\r  No, no, no, no, no, no!\r  You were on the Ghost,\r and that all that\r  that was definitely an illusion.\r  It may have been, but\r I assure you, I am not.\r  - No way out, Padawan.\r - There's always a way out\r  - if I follow my training.\r - Ready to die, boy,\r  or are you afraid\r to face your demise?\r  No. Afraid of being\r alone again? Sure.\r  Afraid of letting down\r my Master? Absolutely.\r  Your Master lies dead and\r rotting in a forgotten tunnel.\r  You could hardly\r have let him down more.\r  I'm not afraid.\r  Big fears have you faced, young one.\r  Yes.\r  Hmm. For what lies ahead,\r ready are you?\r  I am.\r  Come. See more clearly\r what you could not see before.\r  - Who are you?\r - A guide.\r  The kid's taking too long.\r  Patience. Remember you\r nothing of your own training?\r  Master Yoda!\r  It can't be. I'm losing it.\r  Losing? Lost. Yes.\r  But what loss, hmm?\r The question, that is.\r  Master? How\r How can this be?\r  Be not concerned with how.\r  Know I am here because\r you are here.\r  Thank you, Master.\r  Thank you? Hmm.\r Nothing have I done.\r  Hmm. See you, I can.\r Before, I could not.\r  Changed, something has.\r  I've taken on an apprentice.\r  Apprentice? Hmm.\r And now Master are you?\r  Of this decision, honest you must be.\r  It's true.\r  I'm not sure of my decision\r to train Ezra.\r  Not because of him or his abilities\r  because of me,\r because of who I am.\r  Which way is the right way?\r  The wrong question, that is.\r  I'm sorry.\r I don't understand.\r  To be honest, I don't even\r know what I'm doing here.\r  A better question, that is.\r  Kanan said I was gonna be tested,\r but he never said what for or why.\r  And your Master\r tell you everything, must he?\r  Well No.\r  Your path you must decide.\r  A dangerous time this is\r for your apprentice, for you.\r  I know. I can sense it.\r  I feel as if his abilities are\r growing faster than I can teach him.\r  You sense, or you fear?\r  I lost my way for a long time,\r  but now I have a chance\r to change things.\r  Hmm. Last chance.\r  I won't let him lose his way,\r not like I did.\r  Whoa.\r  Tell me.\r Why must you become Jedi?\r  I don't know. I guess\r because Kanan believes I can.\r  Ah. Kanan thinks you can.\r Hmm. And you?\r  Well, I'll become stronger,\r powerful.\r  Ah. Power you seek.\r  I'd make the Empire suffer\r for everything it did,\r  for everything it took,\r for my parents!\r  I I wouldn't be helpless anymore!\r  Ah. Jedi way is revenge?\r  Teach you this, your Master did?\r  No. Kanan would never.\r  He's a good Master,\r a-a great Master.\r  - Then why seek you revenge?\r - I don't.\r  Hmm. Inside you much anger,\r much fear.\r  I just want to protect\r myself and my friends.\r  And this is why you must be Jedi?\r  Yes, and not just them.\r  Everyone.\r I'll protect everyone.\r  Before I met Kanan, I only\r ever thought of myself,\r  but Kanan and the rest,\r they don't think like that.\r  They help people, they give\r everything away, and I see it.\r  I see how it makes people feel.\r  Feel, yes.

Wow.\r  - What's a kyber crystal?\r - It's a lightsaber crystal.\r  I have to admit, when I brought you\r here, I didn't see this happening.\r  Getting a lightsaber crystal\r is a big step.\r  It's strange that it's just here.\r  And it will be, for now,\r  and hopefully it'll be here\r long after you and I are gone.\r  I was just thinking shouldn't\r we use it as a base or something?\r  Who knows what else is in there?\r  I know what's in there.\r The past.\r  He's been working\r on that thing for weeks.\r  What kind of lightsaber\r could he possibly build\r  with the junk\r we have laying around?\r  Well, I had a few spare\r parts I found over the years.\r  And I had some bits and\r pieces that might work\r  modulation circuits, an energy gate.\r  Chopper even donated a power cell.\r  I gave him some additional tech.\r  He was pretty specific\r about what he was looking for.\r  I thought I'd let you\r check it out first.\r  Well, it's different.\r  But that seems about right for you.\r Go for it.\r      \n                "}, "Trials of the Darksaber": {"episode": "s03e14", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t(ENGINES ROARING)\r  (CHOPPER GRUNTING)\r  All right, all right.\r  You wanted to speak with me?\r  I've got something to show you.\r  What's this about?\r  A lightsaber?\r  Not just any lightsaber.\r  (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)\r  It can't be.\r  So you recognize it?\r  That I do.\r  It is the darksaber,\r  a symbol for the leader\r of House Vizsla,\r  and later, the group\r known as Death Watch.\r  I didn't know Mandalorians\r developed a type of lightsaber.\r  We didn't.\r This was one of a kind.\r  Legend tells that it was created\r over a thousand years ago\r  by Tarre Vizsla,\r  the first Mandalorian ever\r inducted into the Jedi Order.\r  After his passing, the Jedi\r kept the saber in their temple.\r  That was, until members of House\r Vizsla snuck in and liberated it.\r  They used the saber\r to unify the people\r  and strike down those\r who would oppose them.\r  One time, they ruled all of Mandalore\r wielding this blade.\r  This saber is an important\r symbol to that house\r  and respected\r by the other clans.\r  I imagine Sabine was\r excited to recover it.\r  (HUFFS) You wouldn't know it.\r  After we got back from Dathomir,\r  she gave it to me\r for safekeeping\r  and hasn't brought it up since.\r  She doesn't want\r the responsibility.\r  Kanan, if Sabine can\r wield this saber,\r  she can reunite one of the most\r powerful houses in all of Mandalore.\r  You're talking about\r raising an army.\r  With Sabine leading it.\r   (CHOPPER GRUNTING)\r  Come in.\r  (GRUNTING)\r  Who all is there?\r  (CHOPPER GRUNTS)\r  Everybody, huh?\r  (PURRING)\r  I won't do it.\r  So you do know\r what the darksaber is.\r  I know it caused my family nothing\r but trouble after Maul took it.\r  Maul used it to divide\r and conquer our people.\r  You can wield it\r to do the opposite.\r  Wield it?

Then we'll see.\r  I know she can do it,\r  but it just seems like Kanan is asking\r her to learn everything at once.\r  She just needs more time.\r  Time is a luxury,\r  one the galaxy seems\r to be running out of.\r  She's back.\r  I owe you an apology.\r  I can say the same.\r  Uh, maybe I should\r practice more first.\r  Take it.

He said his\r parents used it to broadcast from.\r  I don't get it.\r They weren't soldiers, just citizens.\r  - So why'd they risk it all?\r - They had hope.

You know what I smell like?\r - Can we focus, please?\r  - What do you think?\r - Better safe than sorry.\r  What was that?\r  My sensors indicate it came from\r the ship. Better investigate.\r  - Hold on. You two, up top.\r - Want a lift?\r  Hello. Who's there?\r  - Senator Trayvis. We're friends.\r - Welcome!\r  I was beginning to think no\r one on Lothal got my message.\r  Senator, you're in terrible danger.\r  - The Empire knows you're here.\r - That's impossible.\r  Kanan Jarrus, Jedi Knight.\r  Padawan Jabba.\r And what have we here?\r  A Twi'lek I've yet to meet.\r  From your regalia, I suspect\r you must be our talented pilot.\r  Where is the Lasat and\r the Mandalorian girl?\r  If you won't talk, then my\r troopers will become a firing squad.\r  You'd better do as he says.\r  Don't worry, Senator.\r Our friends will be along.\r  Stay close, Senator.\r  - We've gotta get Trayvis out of here!\r - Follow us.\r  Was really hoping that\r shuttle'd still be here.\r  And that's not the\r ride we're looking for.\r  Agent Kallus, they must not escape!\r  They haven't, Minister.\r  They won't.\r  You want me to go in there?\r  It's not so bad once you\r get used to the smell.\r  You never get used to the smell.\r  Go!\r  Get this open.

Senator?\r What are you doing?\r  Put your saber down, boy.\r Now!\r  You're\r You're with the Empire?\r  But all your transmissions,\r those planets you visited.\r  - How did word not get out about you?\r - Because no one ever knew\r  not even my own droids.\r Insurgents are not arrested.\r  They're identified and watched.\r  The troublesome ones have\r accidents after I'm gone.\r  But you're not a traitor.\r  You're a voice of freedom, a\r a light in the darkness,\r  - like my parents!\r - Parents?\r  No one has spoken against\r the Empire on Lothal since\r  the Bridger transmissions.\r  I remember them.\r The original voices of freedom.\r  - You're their son.\r - Why? Why?!\r  I joined the Empire\r like your parents should have\r  for their lives, for you.\r  Your parents were very brave\r and very foolish.\r  Where are they now?\r I'll tell you, my boy.\r  They're gone!\r  - They're not gone, Trayvis.\r - Stop right there.\r  As long as we fight, all that\r they spoke out for lives on.\r  I said stop!\r  What?\r No!\r  A true rebel would know if\r he's holding a charged blaster.\r  - You knew!\r - He tried to get us to surrender.\r  He wasn't tired when he stopped.\r  He was waiting for Kallus to catch up.\r And he wanted our secrets.\r  I didn't want to believe it.\r  - What happened to the senator?\r - He was working for the Empire.\r  Is there anybody on our side?\r  So guess he stays here.\r What's our plan?\r  We were gonna stop\r the fan to get through.\r  Okay, but what will keep\r our friends from following?\r  We only stop it long enough\r for us to get past it.

We need a new hyperspace route\r in and out of the Lothal sector.\r  I may have a perfect shortcut.\r  The system of Concord Dawn.\r  It's a Mandalorian colony and\r not an Imperial territory yet.\r  Why not? They've grabbed up\r just about every other place.\r  Concord Dawn is known\r for its elite warriors.\r  They were brought in to train\r clones back in the war.\r  Bet even the Empire thinks\r twice about a fight with them.\r  The question is, who are they loyal to?\r  The Empire does occupy\r their home world of Mandalore,\r  so Imperial influence\r could be a factor.\r  Years before the Clone Wars broke out,\r  the Mandalorians were already\r at war with each other.\r  This group call themselves\r the Protectors.\r  - They like to make up their own rules.\r - Sounds familiar.\r  So we go in with strength,\r  scout the system for defenses\r to see what we're up against.\r  Or why not try diplomacy?\r  Ask permission to use their\r system as a shortcut.\r  Diplomacy?\r  Warriors like these\r only understand strength.\r  He's got a point.\r  But we shouldn't make an\r enemy if we don't need to.\r  If we get permission to\r fly through their space,\r  the next step could be recruitment.\r  To grow the rebellion, we need\r friends like these Mandalorians.\r  We could have our route\r and a powerful ally as well.\r  Very well, Captain Syndulla.\r  The mission is yours.\r  - Okay if I tag along?\r - I was hoping you'd ask.\r  Hmm. Looks like diplomacy\r won the day for once.\r  There was a time\r when it always won the day.\r  So, that's Concord Dawn.\r  Sure looks like\r it's been through a war.\r  This system has endured\r more than a hundred wars.\r  My people don't need \r a reason to pick a fight.\r  Phoenix Squadron,\r we have visitors.\r  Everybody, stay sharp.\r  Attention, unregistered ships.\r  This is Fenn Rau,\r Protector of Concord Dawn.\r  You are trespassing.\r Identify yourselves.\r  - We come in peace, Protector.\r - Peace?\r  That's not a word I hear often.\r State your mission.\r  We request safe passage\r through your system.\r  Well, that depends.\r Who is asking?\r  Those who would stand\r with Concord Dawn\r  against the Empire.\r  So you're the rebels I've heard about.\r  How unfortunate for you.\r  You haven't\r heard what we have to say.\r  I don't need to. Out here, I\r act in the name of the Empire.\r  Hold on, Protector.\r  I'm hit!\r  Hera,\r what do we do? What do we do?\r   I don't think they're interested\r in talking, Hera.\r  Phoenix Squadron,\r take evasive action.\r  Spectre-5, Phoenix-2,\r get out of here.\r  There's too much fire.\r I can't get an opening.\r  He's right. If we attempt to\r jump, we'll be cut to pieces.\r  Go to heading 257.\r I'll get your opening.\r  What about you?\r  Just follow orders, Sabine.\r  Roger that.\r  That's it, Protector. Follow me.\r  What are you up to?\r  Hera, where's that opening?\r  Prepare to jump.\r  Coordinates set.\r Thanks, Phoenix Leader.\r  - Get going, Sabine.\r - Not without you.\r  Just go!\r I'll be right behind you.\r  Close ranks.\r  Sabine, what happened?\r  We picked up a distress call.\r  Kanan, we didn't have a chance.\r  These Mandalorians\r work for the Empire, too.\r  Hera.\r  Hera, can you hear me?\r  I see her. I see her, Kanan.\r It's bad.\r  You've\r got to hurry. Please hurry!\r  - How is she?\r - Her vital signs have stabilized.\r  She is going to make it.\r But she requires rest.\r  This is my fault.\r I shouldn't have left her.\r  There's nothing\r you could have done.\r  I'm just glad you're\r both back in one piece.\r  Commander Sato wants the\r details on what happened.\r  - Yeah, I'll be right there.\r - Okay.\r  I'm so sorry, Hera.\r  They're going to answer for this.\r  Fenn Rau, the Protector \r of Concord Dawn.\r  That's who did this.\r That's who we're up against.\r  Rex, does that name\r sound familiar to you?\r  It sure does.\r  Fenn Rau was a fighter pilot instructor\r for the Grand Army of the Republic.\r  He also served\r At the Battle of Mygeeto.\r  I know. I was there.\r  That was a long time ago.\r  Yeah? You want to negotiate?\r  Let's negotiate, by destroying\r their ability to attack us.\r  I tracked them from Concord Dawn's third\r moon. They must have a base there.\r  If they scan our fleet approaching,\r their fighters will cut us to pieces.\r  Then I guess we'll have to hit\r 'em before they take off.\r  You think you can\r infiltrate their base?\r  I believe I can.\r  We can take out\r their fighters, all of them.\r  Hmm.\r  - It's risky, but I approve.\r - Well, I don't.\r  This is a solo mission,\r and I'm taking it.\r  I'm already one man down.\r I won't risk anyone else.\r  Kanan, I know\r the Mandalorians.\r  You need me on this mission.\r  - No way.\r - We're a team.\r  You can't go\r without us.\r  All right. I'll take Chopper.\r  But that's all. And this is not\r open for further discussion.\r  Come on, Chopper.\r  Come on, Chopper!\r  Ow!\r  I can hear you. And, yes,\r I know what I'm doing.\r  Just program the nav computer.\r  Chopper, load up the intel\r Sabine gathered.\r  We can pinpoint\r where their base is.\r  What do you mean,\r \"Just ask her\"?\r  He means I'm standing\r right behind you.\r  - Better jam those scanners.\r - What are you doing here?\r  So, what are you\r really up to?\r  You heard Sato's orders.\r  I'm gonna destroy those\r fighters before they take off.\r  I know you better than that.\r  Fine. I'm going to finish\r Hera's mission.\r  We need to recruit the Mandalorians\r to join the rebellion.\r  The Protectors almost killed Hera.\r What are you thinking?\r  I'm thinking we can still offer\r them a chance to change.\r  Everyone deserves a chance.\r  You know, this Jedi philosophy\r stuff doesn't work for everyone.\r  That's why we're at war.\r  Well? What are we up against?\r  Including the two starfighters on patrol?\r Eight ships total.\r  But they're spread out,\r  so it's gonna take me a\r while to plant charges.\r  I think I brought\r enough explosives.\r  You always bring enough explosives.\r  Hopefully you won't have to use 'em.\r  Now get down. They got company.\r  Looks like the Empire\r bought their loyalty.\r  See the Mandalorian\r accepting the credits?\r  That's their leader, Fenn Rau.\r  Here is the payment\r for the next rotation.\r  This arrangement is working\r to your benefit.\r  - I encountered a squadron of rebels.\r - The rebel fleet?\r  Not an entire fleet. A couple fighters.\r But my men and I took care of them.\r  If they return, be sure to contact us.\r  Sounds like your negotiations\r are gonna go great.\r  What's the plan? I mean,\r if diplomacy doesn't work.\r  You give me a chance\r to recruit the Mandalorians.\r  If that doesn't work out, then you\r get to blow up their fighters.\r  We have a deal?\r  Fine. But not just the ships. Rau\r has to pay for what he did to Hera.\r  Let's hope it doesn't come to that.\r  Two rebels burned.\r The rest fled.\r  He wants us to stay on guard.\r  Plant your bombs,\r but wait for my signal.\r  All right.\r  Hey. I trust you.\r  Pretty bold to sneak onto my base.\r  I'm gonna assume you're one of\r those rebels I dealt with earlier.\r  That's a pretty good guess,\r but not the entire truth.\r  I don't recognize you,\r so before I gun you down,\r  why don't you tell me\r what you want?\r  We never met, but I do know you.\r  In fact, I came to thank you.\r  In the Clone Wars, you fought\r in the Third Battle of Mygeeto.\r  And I was there.\r  You're a survivor.\r  That explains how\r you got past my men.\r  My master, Depa Billaba, and I were\r pinned down, trapped by droids.\r  You and your Skull Squadron flew into the\r Separatist fire over and over to cover us.\r  - You saved our lives.\r - Mmm. That was a long time ago.\r  I was younger\r and more reckless then.\r  To be honest, I don't see what that\r has to do with you being here.\r  You gave me a chance to live that day.\r  Now I'd like to return the favor.\r  - Ow!\r - What was that?\r  How's it going, boys?\r  Where did you steal that\r armor from, bounty hunter?\r  Bounty hunter? Not lately.\r  I forged this armor with my family.\r  Family? That's a bold claim.\r  What's your house?\r  I'm Clan Wren, House Vizsla.\r  House Vizsla? She's Death Watch.\r Traitor!\r  My mother was, but I'm not.\r  I came here to settle a score,\r  and I invoke the code to seek\r justice through single combat.\r  No one has invoked the code\r since the Empire took over.\r  Well, who's in charge here?\r The Empire or Mandalore?\r  I already fought one losing war for\r the Jedi. I'm not fighting another.\r  You can't possibly believe\r in the Empire.\r  I believe they have\r the strength to defeat you\r  and the resources to back it up.\r  Why would I fight the Empire,\r  when obviously destroying\r you is so much easier?\r  You must know the Empire isn't\r interested in sharing their power.\r  In the end, everyone is their enemy.\r  If we don't stand together,\r then we're all alone.\r  Alone is who we are.\r  Sir. We have an infiltrator.\r  Don't worry. I have the\r Jedi under control.\r  I don't know anything about this Jedi,\r  but a Mandalorian trespasser\r has invoked the code.\r  She claims she's House Vizsla.\r  I assume she came here with you?\r  Let me handle this.\r  I'm afraid it's out of\r your control now, Jedi.\r  Sabine, I thought\r we had an agreement.\r  They started it.\r  Your house is an enemy\r to the Protectors.\r  Call out your opponent\r for combat to the death.\r  I thought you'd never ask.\r  I call out you, Fenn Rau.\r  You're gonna pay\r for what you did to Hera.\r  Just like I said, you rebels \r fight battles you can't win.\r  I assume Hera is the pilot\r I shot to pieces earlier.\r  - I guess she didn't make it.\r - She's alive. Barely.\r  I got to admit this is\r an interesting development.\r  One of you came here to befriend\r me, the other came to kill me.\r  We can't let you attack our fleet.\r  But we'd rather leave here as friends.\r  He's already the enemy.\r  Sabine, you know\r this isn't what Hera wanted.\r  She didn't want to create enemies\r and she wouldn't want you to die.\r  I'm not planning on dying.\r  I'm afraid the only way you're getting\r out of here alive is if she kills me,\r  and that is not going to happen.\r  What is it with you Mandalorians,\r  never knowing how to solve anything\r except through the end of a blaster?\r  Sabine, you do this,\r you're no better than him.\r  You have to trust me.\r  Sabine, you make this choice\r and, win or lose,\r  the Empire is going to be all\r over this system and the fleet.\r  Kanan, you need to stop talking now.\r  There are alternatives to killing.\r  Come on!\r  Capture them alive. I want them\r to watch their fleet burn.\r  Are you feeling better now?\r You got to blow stuff up.\r  I thought you'd be happy\r I didn't kill anyone.\r  - Actually, I'm thrilled.\r - Well, here's the bad news,\r  Rau's fighter is\r at the far end of the field,\r  and I wasn't able to set the charges\r on it before they captured me.\r  You're saying we\r should go after him?\r  Yes!\r  For the first time today,\r we agree on something.\r  Fine. But we are still not killing anyone.\r  You love making\r this hard for me.\r  Chopper, I think we're done here.\r  Kanan. How's the plan going?\r  - Just get up here!\r - Okay! Hang on!\r  Still think we can't win?\r  Our ride's here.\r  No!\r  Kanan!\r  When you set your mind to something,\r you're kind of frightening.\r  - How do you feel?\r - Like a prisoner.\r  - Better get that.\r - Are you crazy?\r  You can't let a prisoner receive\r outside communications.\r  Just answer it.\r  Sir, are you all right?\r  We're marshaling our reserve\r starfighters for pursuit.\r  Stand down. There's no need.\r  But, sir, if the Empire\r finds out about your capture\r  You're not gonna let that happen.\r  And the rebels?\r  Until I give the word, there is\r to be no mention of the rebels.\r  And their ships are to be granted\r safe passage through our system.\r  As you wish.\r  Welcome to the Rebellion.\r  Right now we are only friends\r because we have to be.\r  What does that mean?\r  Well, the Empire doesn't make\r a habit of rescuing people.\r  The last thing Rau wants is Imperial\r ships all over his territory,\r  and that's exactly what he'd get if\r they found out he was our prisoner.\r  Kanan. Sabine.\r  Hera wants to see you.\r  I hear we're taking prisoners now.\r  I like to think of him more\r as a reluctant recruit.\r  It was better than the alternative.\r  We're not at war with the Protectors.\r  There was no need to take their\r lives if we didn't have to.\r  Hmm. Sabine, you're sounding more\r like a Jedi than a Mandalorian.\r  Well, I guess I've just \r been raised right.\r      \n                "}, "In the Name of the Rebellion: Part Two": {"episode": "s04e04", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe words you're looking\r for are \"thank you.\"\r  We appreciate the save, Saw.\r  We turned the worst-case\r scenario into the best.\r  Yeah, I wish Hera\r would see it that way.\r  Technically, we just disobeyed\r orders by blowing up that relay.\r  Following orders\r will only get you so far.\r  Then you have to take control\r of your destiny.\r  Yeah, like when we hit the\r Empire hard on Mandalore.\r  I heard about that.\r  It's exactly why I need your help.\r  You need our help?\r  (HOLOGRAM BEEPS)\r  This is Faos Station.\r  I recently acquired intel\r on a secret Imperial cargo\r  being loaded aboard\r a civilian freighter there.\r  What cargo?\r  Remember Geonosis?\r  The Empire wiped out a whole population\r  because they were building something.\r  Something they've hidden away.\r  I never stopped looking for it.\r  What have you found?\r  Just rumors.

Knew there had\r to be a way this was my fault.\r  And you were right, dear.\r  Zeb, I'll need the Phantom\r ready to pick up the supplies\r  from Fulcrum. Adjust the\r steering and run a diagnostic.\r  Chopper and Ezra will help\r you fix any problems you find.\r  Really? \r Have you met them?\r  - Hey!\r - And I'm leaving soon, so get to it.\r  - What happened out there?\r - Well, we took out the target.\r  Yeah. I got that part.\r  Fulcrum was right about\r the timing and route\r  but underestimated\r the Imperial defenses.\r  It's getting harder to anticipate\r the Empire's moves. That's for sure.\r  Yeah, about that\r  I'd like to know why we're relying on\r intel from this Fulcrum, whoever he is.\r  It's Hera's job to find\r missions that create problems for\r  - the Empire and profit for us.\r - If she trusts the contact,\r  I trust the contact.\r No questions asked.\r  At the Imperial Academy\r  they didn't want me to\r ask questions either.\r  That didn't work for me.\r That's why I ended up here.\r  - And we're glad to have you.\r - You are so frustrating.\r  Yeah, I've heard that before.\r  Fine. I'm done asking questions.\r  I'm telling you: I'm coming\r on your run to meet Fulcrum.\r  You know, you can be\r pretty frustrating too.\r  Learned from the best.\r  This diagnostic's taking forever.\r How's it going in there?\r  Hera was right. Steering's\r definitely out of whack.\r  But I almost got it fixed.\r  There we go.\r  Life support filters need cleansing.\r  Chopper, as soon as Ezra's out\r of the repair duct, purge 'em.\r  All fixed!\r  Whoa! Hey!\r  Perfect. Steering and life\r support are back in working order.\r  Nice work.\r  Sorry, kid.\r I told him to wait till you were out.\r  Not funny.\r  Hold it.

It's no secret we're\r fighting against the Empire.\r  We need as many allies as we can get.\r  How do you find a way of\r answering questions without\r  - giving any answers?\r - Do you really want me to answer that?\r  Phantom, this is Fulcrum. \r Come in.\r  - This is Specter-2, Fulcrum.\r - Why don't I talk to him?\r  Don't you dare.\r  Already at the rendezvous, Specter-2.\r  Supplies are unloaded\r and ready. Should I wait?\r  Yeah, stick around. Specter-2\r and I would love to talk to you.\r  Specter-2, what's the problem?\r  No problem, Fulcrum.\r  Specter-5 decided to\r help with the supply run.\r  Understood. Fulcrum out.\r  You know, an outburst like\r that is not appreciated.\r  Neither is all this secrecy.\r  So, where's the mystery man?\r  I don't know. Maybe Fulcrum\r didn't like your attitude.\r  I know I didn't.\r  I'll take that one.\r  Look, Hera, I'm sorry for the attitude.\r  It's just things seem to be\r getting more dangerous every day,\r  and I need to know that\r you and Kanan can trust me.\r  We trust you, Sabine. We just\r can't tell you everything.\r  It's for the safety of the whole crew.\r  If captured, you can't\r reveal what you don't know.\r  You think I'd talk?\r  I think we think\r  the Imperials can make anyone talk.\r  You've seen what they're capable of.\r  Yeah, I have.\r That's why I need to know.\r  You already know exactly what\r you need to know and no more.\r  I need you to trust me now.\r  And that's supposed\r to make me feel better?\r  Hera, you know what happened when I was\r  a cadet at the Imperial\r Academy on Mandalore.\r  I trusted the Empire,\r followed its orders blindly,\r  and it was a nightmare.\r  I want to believe we're doing\r good, making a difference.\r  But sometimes it seems\r like the harder we fight,\r  the harder things get out there.\r  I feel like we can't take\r down the Empire on our own.\r  That's why I need to know\r this isn't all for nothing.\r  I need to know that I am not\r walking into another nightmare here.\r  What you need is faith.\r  Faith that there is a long-term\r plan that's bigger than you or me,\r  bigger than Lothal, bigger\r than the entire Outer Rim.\r  Have faith in that and in us.\r  We Kanan\r He knows what he's doing.\r  Hera.\r  Look.\r  There were more crates, but\r someone's dragged them away.\r  - Maybe he's still here.\r - Who?\r  - Fulcrum?\r - No.\r  - Well, who else knows about this place?\r - Not sure.\r  This base was abandoned years\r ago, after the Clone Wars.\r  Besides, why drag them?\r Why not use the anti-grav?\r  Whoa. Sunrise comes\r along fast in these parts.\r  Let's see what else comes along.\r  Whoever did this must have\r been pretty eager to get what was inside.\r  Too eager to just flip\r the latch and open them?\r  Who would\r  We're not dealing with a who.\r More like a what.\r  That's comforting.\r  You don't happen to know\r why this base was abandoned?\r  I'm starting to have my suspicions.\r  Sabine, run!\r  Whatever those creatures\r are, they can't take the sun.\r  Good, but do you see the\r size of that asteroid?\r  That's going to block out\r the sun for a long time.\r  - How long?\r - I don't know.\r  Long enough for us to become lunch.\r  Luckily we weren't planning on staying.\r  All right. Let's get to work.\r  Last one.\r  Good. Let's go.\r  No, no, no, no, no!\r We had nearly a full tank\r  when we landed.\r Now we're out of fuel?\r  Hera's not here to save you now.\r  Whoa!\r  That's it!\r  Specter-2 to Specter-4. \r Come in.\r  Specter-2 to Specter-4.\r Come in!\r  Go ahead, Specter-2.\r  You did run a full diagnostic\r on the Phantom, correct?\r  - Of course.\r - And you checked the results?\r  Um, Specter-2, there might be\r a small problem with the fuel line.\r  Small problem?\r Uh, guys, we have a situation.\r  This is your fault, you and Chopper!\r  You were the one\r running the diagnostic.\r  - You should have checked.\r - I'll check you into the wall.\r  We have to tell Kanan.\r But don't tell him it's our fault.\r  Okay.\r  - Kanan.\r - Kanan.\r  Hera and Sabine are in danger.\r  Wow. How could you tell?\r Could you sense it?\r  No. I could hear you two\r yelling outside the door.\r  We're on our way.\r Ghost out.\r  No way they get here before that\r asteroid blocks the sun and\r  - I guess we could hole up in the Phantom?\r - Judging by the torn-up\r  shuttle in there, locking ourselves\r in the Phantom won't protect us.\r  - Could get grim.\r - Well, I'll take grim right now.\r  Thought I recognized these markings.\r  Allow me to introduce you\r to one of my oldest and most\r  explosive friends: rhydonium.\r  It's good to have friends.\r So what's your plan?\r  Since we don't know how many\r of those creatures are in there,\r  we can set up groups of canisters\r  and create explosions that\r take them out a wave at a time.\r  How will you get the creatures close\r enough to the rhydonium to be effective?\r  - We're gonna need bait.\r - Where do we get that?\r  We don't get it. We are it.\r  Wave one. Move.\r  - Wow. A lot of 'em.\r - Steady now. Follow the plan.\r  Fall back! Wave two.\r  Wait for 'em.\r  Now!\r  It worked.\r We just might survive this.\r  - Wait. You doubted your own plan?\r - Never.\r  - Good, 'cause I sure did.\r - Hey!\r  Come on. They're closing in.\r Wave three.\r  Wave four. Incoming!\r  Oh. Did I mention\r there are a lot of 'em?\r  Sounds familiar.\r  Light it up.\r  - Coming in from both sides.\r - What about wave five?\r  We didn't have a plan for wave five.\r  Afraid of that.\r The Phantom?\r  Not inside. Go up top.\r  They just keep coming!\r  Tell me something I don't know.\r  - We're going to die.\r - That's no secret.\r  - The light's not hurting them.\r - Then we better move.\r  Sabine!

Maybe because the\r last time they \"fixed\" it,\r  - we nearly wound up as lunch?\r - Oh, right. That's why.\r  Sabine, I know you have questions,\r  questions I can't answer right now.\r  But know that I trust you.\r  I just trusted you\r with my life down there.\r  I know. I know you do.\r  Good.

We gotta\r get ready for our mission.\r  Tell me what\r you're thinking, Kanan.\r  I'm thinking whatever Ezra\r went through with Maul,\r  it's not over yet.\r  Stop. We have all the proton\r torpedoes we need for this mission.\r  Well, not according to the\r weapons expert, which is me.\r  I want two more cases\r of 'em loaded up.\r  Why am I the last one to\r know about supply changes?\r  I cannot work\r under these conditions.\r  Ugh, it's like AP-5 and Chopper were\r made on the same assembly line.\r  (CHOPPER GRUNTING)\r  Oh, I'm the one who needs\r an attitude adjustment?\r  It's him. I It's Maul.\r  Ezra?\r  Hey, Ezra!\r  Ezra? Chop, go get Kanan.\r  (GRUNTS)\r  Out of the way!\r There he is!\r  I see him.\r  (SINISTER LAUGHING)\r  Ezra. Stop!\r  (LAUGHING CONTINUES)\r  I knew it!\r  Ezra!\r  Ezra, wait!\r Let me go!\r  Kanan!\r What are you doing?\r  Ezra! It's not Maul!\r Look at him!\r  (GASPING)\r  You're out of your mind, kid!\r  I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\r  What's happening to me?\r  Maybe I should postpone the mission,\r  - stay here with him.\r - Ezra will be fine.\r  - I've got a plan.\r - (SIGHS) Be careful, Kanan.\r  We will.\r  I'm surprised\r she got on the ship.\r  - I told her I had a plan.\r - Really?\r  - And she left anyway?\r - Very funny. Come on.\r  Ezra's wrist com?\r  I need you to put a tracker\r on it without him knowing.\r  Bendu. You knew we were coming.\r  Yes.\r  You're not exactly\r quiet creatures, hmm?\r  Tell him what's happening.\r  The dark side wielder\r I told you about,\r  the one who wanted to join\r the holocrons together.\r  I've seen him\r here on Atollon.\r  I warned you, joining\r the holocrons together\r  could bring both\r great wisdom\r  and great danger.\r  I know. I felt their power.\r  And I did see things, but my\r vision, it was incomplete.\r  Incomplete?\r  Yeah, I let go before either of\r us got the answers we wanted,\r  and then the holocrons\r were destroyed.\r  Aha. I see.\r  Well, that's not good.\r  What do you mean, \"That's not good\"?\r What can we do?\r  What do you want to do, hmm?\r  I want to stop seeing Maul.\r  Then don't turn around.\r  Bendu, what should we do?\r  This is a strange place.\r  So remote.\r  Oh, yes, the Empire will have a\r difficult time finding you here.\r  Y You think\r I came here to fight?\r  I came here to speak\r with my apprentice.\r  - He's not your apprentice.\r - Yet.\r  How did you find me?\r  When you abruptly severed our\r connection with the holocron,\r  you mixed up\r the information.\r  You learned a bit\r of what I want to know,\r  and I learned a bit\r of what you wanted to know.\r  But there were fragments\r and memories left in my mind.\r  Like the location\r of our base.\r  Yes. (CHUCKLES)\r Very good.\r  Oh, you do learn fast,\r apprentice.\r  Look, I can't make sense\r of what I saw.\r  I couldn't even describe it\r if I wanted to.\r  And that is why\r you need to come with me,\r  so I can retrieve the answers\r which are just out of reach.\r  So you get your answers, but\r what do we get out of it?\r  I will keep\r your rebel base secret.\r  No deal. You're not walking\r off this rock in one piece.\r  (CHUCKLING)\r  I have planted\r a beacon nearby.\r  Strike me down,\r and it will activate,\r  revealing your presence\r to the Empire.\r  You have knowledge\r that is rightfully mine.\r  I have knowledge\r that you want.\r  The key to defeating the Sith.\r  What I propose\r will satisfy us both.\r  All right.\r  Ezra, you're not\r doing this.\r  He's going to expose\r Chopper Base.\r  We'll move, build a new base.\r  (SIGHS) Maul won't hurt me, Kanan.\r He needs me.\r  Besides, this might be our last\r chance to learn the secret\r  of how we can\r destroy the Sith.\r  (SIGHS)\r  I do not like this.\r  But we don't really\r have a choice, do we?\r  I'm gonna trust you\r on this.\r  All right. We have a deal.\r  After you, my apprentice.\r  I'm tracking Ezra's signal. They\r just made the jump to hyperspace.\r  Let's get going.\r I don't wanna lose 'em.\r  Where are we?\r  That is Dathomir, my home.\r  If this is your home, where are\r your people? Where is everybody?\r  I am the last survivor.\r  My family, the Nightsisters,\r were killed.\r  Masterful witches they were.\r  A threat to the Empire.\r  I know that\r you can relate.\r  These witches,\r they use the Force?\r  Some aspect, yes.\r  But it was their connection to\r this planet that made them strong.\r  That is why we are here,\r  to perform some old magic.\r  Yes. Yes, everything that we\r need lies within the cave.\r  I'm not going any further until\r you tell me how this works.\r  The only way to access the knowledge\r we seek is to merge our minds again.\r  The effect will only\r last a moment.\r  Just enough time\r for each of us\r  to find the answers\r to our questions.\r  Trust me, Ezra.\r  I only want the answers\r I deserve, nothing more.\r  What do we have to do?\r  Come.\r  I have gathered many things,\r  secrets to help us\r restore our memories.\r  Look at all this junk.\r  Do not touch anything.\r  These are artifacts\r from my past,\r  from a time when my power\r was almost absolute.\r  Get away from there!\r  Is that a lightsaber?\r  Indeed, yes,\r  but not like any\r that you would know.\r  If your Mandalorian friend\r was here,\r  (CHUCKLES) she could\r explain it to you.\r  Why is Ezra so willing\r to trust Maul again and again?\r  I don't think he is,\r  but I do know he's taking\r a big risk for all of us.\r  I have studied the ways\r of the Nightsisters\r  and found a spell\r that suits our needs.\r  This This altar\r  is the focus\r of their ancient power.\r  Now, to initiate the merge, we\r We must each drink this potion.\r  Mmm, you first.\r  Mmm.\r  To complete the spell,\r you must drink it all.\r  Just like me,\r all of it.\r  Mmm, ha. It's working.\r  (COUGHING)\r  (BEEPS) They should be this way.\r Come on.\r  Where is he?\r  I want to know\r how to destroy the Sith.\r  I see. I understand.\r  Who is that?\r  I know him.\r  (GASPS) Of course.\r  It ends where it began.\r  A desert planet\r with twin suns.\r  He's alive.\r  I I can't believe\r he's alive.\r  It is time\r to pay our debt.\r  Wait, wait, wait!\r What's happening?\r  (GROWLING)\r  - What is that?\r - Pay our due.\r  (GASPS) The spirits of the Nightsisters\r  must be compensated\r  for the use of their magic.\r  So pay 'em,\r and let's get out of here!\r  The price is our\r flesh and blood!\r  - Don't let them touch you!\r - Now you tell me?\r  Ezra!\r  - Pay our due.\r - Kanan, Sabine! Stay back!\r  (SINISTER LAUGHING)\r  (SCREAMS)\r  (GASPS)\r  (LAUGHING)\r  (GASPS)\r  - Ezra!\r - Stay back.\r  Kanan?\r  Sabine?\r  Sabine! It's Ezra!\r  You better not hurt him!\r  We cannot defeat the spirits\r of the Nightsisters!\r  Follow me. I will show you\r how to save your friends.\r  Faster! We must reach\r the cave entrance.\r  Wait. Why aren't they\r coming after us?\r  The altar is the source\r of their power.\r  They cannot venture\r beyond the cave.\r  It is unfortunate\r about your friends, Ezra.\r  But this This is your opportunity\r to embrace your destiny,\r  as my apprentice.\r  I told you, that is\r never going to happen!\r  Forget the past!\r  Forget your memories!\r  Forget your attachments.\r  Our futures converge\r on a planet with two suns.\r  We can walk that path together\r as friends, as brothers.\r  My friends are trapped\r in there because of us.\r  I can't just leave them.\r  You disappoint me,\r  Ezra Bridger.\r  (LAUGHING)\r  (BREATHING DEEPLY)\r  Okay. The altar is where\r their power comes from.\r  So, they can't\r leave the cave,\r  which means I just have to\r get Kanan and Sabine outside.\r  How hard can that be?\r  (QUIET CHITTERING)\r  (SINISTER VOICE) You're unwise\r to reenter our sanctum.\r  That doesn't\r belong to you.\r  Then take it from me, Jedi!\r  (SHRIEKING)\r  No! No! No!\r  You cannot destroy us!\r  You'll never\r save your friends!\r  (LAUGHING)\r  (COUGHING)\r  Ezra? Whatever you got out of Maul,\r I hope it was worth it.\r  Do not go back in there.\r They'll possess you again.\r  What What about you?\r  Won't they possess you, too?\r  I'm counting on it!\r  Kanan?\r  (SINISTER VOICE) Maul\r promised us flesh and blood.\r  With it, we can begin again and rebuild\r the great clan of the Nightsisters.\r  If Maul made you that promise,\r then it's my debt as well.\r  I will pay it.\r Just let my friend go.\r  Perhaps, if you prove\r to be stronger.\r  I know you're in there!\r  I'm not losing you\r to these monsters!\r  Our due must be paid!\r  Spirit, I am the one you want!\r Let him go!\r  (COUGHING)\r  Ezra!\r  You belong to us, boy!\r  Kanan, get out of here!\r  You belong to us, boy.\r The debt must be paid.\r  Now you will pay the price!\r  I'm gonna have to\r owe you one.\r  No!\r  (SHRIEKING)\r  Kanan? I'm here.\r  This is the last time\r we're working with Maul.\r  I sure hope so.\r  Sabine, I told you\r to stay outside.\r  Hey, I've never listened to you before.\r Why start now?\r  Well, was it worth it?\r  Did you find out\r what you wanted to know?\r  Yes.\r  The answer to my question\r of how to destroy the Sith\r  is Obi-Wan Kenobi.\r  You think he's still alive?\r  He must be. But, Kanan,\r Maul's also looking for him.\r  So he knows\r where he is now?\r  The holocron\r didn't tell us that.\r  It just told us\r a planet with two suns.\r  Well, that hardly\r narrows it down.\r  Well, we're gonna\r have to figure it out,\r  because if we don't find\r Master Kenobi before Maul\r  There won't be any way\r to stop the Sith.\r      \n                "}, "Brothers of the Broken Horn": {"episode": "s02e04", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tAim, then fire.\r  Rex, I bet sometimes\r even you miss.\r  Speaking of, you're\r missing Jedi training.\r  Which is now.\r Remember?\r  You know, I can't be\r in two places at once.\r  As a soldier, you're gonna\r have to learn to prioritize.\r  Well, he's not a soldier.\r He's a Jedi.\r  Yeah.\r  What if I don't\r want to be either?\r  What's that\r supposed to mean?\r  Hey,\r practice squad,\r  Hera called\r a meeting.\r  Attendance\r is mandatory.\r  - So, what's bothering him?\r - No idea.

Look,\r someone's in distress,\r  and if there's one thing\r I've learned from Kanan,\r  it's that we help\r people in distress.\r  Well, let's go see what\r Vizago got himself into.\r  I owe him a favor,\r and this could square us.\r  What? I know how to fly.\r   No, I'm not running away\r from my problems.\r  I am simply helping someone\r with their problems.\r  There's a difference.\r  That's Vizago's ship, all right.\r I wonder what happened.\r  Vizago!\r  Cikatro Vizago,\r do you read me?\r  Well, of course, we're\r going to board the ship.\r  Vizago must be\r in trouble.\r  Why else wouldn't he\r answer his comm?\r  They're shut off.\r  Something is\r definitely not right.\r  Vizago? Vizago, is\r Is that is that you?\r  Uh, not exactly.\r  Well, hello there.\r  Allow me to introduce myself.\r  I am Hondo Ohnaka,\r  proud owner of this fine but\r currently inoperative vessel.\r  - Where's Vizago?

How can we help you?\r  Attention, transport.\r  You have breached an\r Imperial checkpoint.\r  Hyperspace\r would be good!\r  Think I got it!\r  Well, Lando, it looks like\r we are off on an adventure!\r  It is as if we were in\r each other's heads.\r  We only just met, and we already\r make a remarkable team.\r  - Yeah, but we're not.\r - Not yet, perhaps.\r  You know, I could\r use you for a job.\r  A little trade,\r that is all.\r  You know, I am an old man.\r  I just need help\r pushing a few crates.\r  Crates of what?\r  Whoa! Whoa.\r Power generators?\r  That's what\r you're smuggling?\r  These are pretty hard to\r get these days, old man.\r  - Expensive, too.\r - You're right.\r  Which is why we will sell\r them at a fair markup.\r  Five hundred percent.\r  Three crates.\r  All right. Two crates,\r and you have a deal.\r  Two. And we split\r the profit of the third.\r  Deal.\r  Me! Ha!\r  Now, let's go split\r up the merchandise.\r  Look, this could come in handy\r if he gives us trouble.\r  Hang on to it, Chop.\r  I know we're\r already in trouble.\r  Just keep your\r comm channel open.\r  Hurry it up, Lando!\r We are on a schedule!\r  So, who is\r the buyer anyway?\r  All right.\r Where's Vizago?\r  Azmorigan.\r  granting me the privilege of\r conducting business with you,\r  O legendary one.\r  Hondo Ohnaka\r at your service.\r  I don't deal with\r washed-up old relics.\r  Come now, let's leave\r your wife out of this.\r  I am certain we can\r reach an accord.\r  Huh.\r  I'm certain we can. Hmm?\r  That was easy.\r  Nice going,\r partner.\r  Looks like\r you got us captured.\r  It would be nice\r if we had some backup!\r  Uh, just a thought,\r  but why don't we just\r call it even and go through\r  with the original deal?\r Sounds good, yes?\r  I appreciate\r your offer, humbly,\r  but I don't think you're\r gonna be around to collect.\r  Azmorigan,\r  take the fruits of our\r labor, if you must.\r  That I understand. But this?\r Is it necessary?\r  Oh, yes.\r  You see, the Rang Clan has a\r nice bounty on your head.\r  I'll collect\r on these generators\r  and make an additional\r profit from your death.\r  Your business plan\r is impressive.\r  Of course, it is.\r It's mine.\r  Uh Who is this?\r  Hey. Hey.\r  I know you\r From somewhere.\r  Calrissian's farm\r on Lothal!\r  Well, of course,\r you know him.\r  This is my longtime\r friend, Lando Calrissian.\r  What?\r  No, he's not Calrissian!\r  You lied to me?\r  I knew I liked you!\r  Uh\r  You\r  You robbed me.\r  Oh, I will enjoy this.\r  I get to collect on Ohnaka,\r  I get to kill you and I get\r to keep the five generators!\r  All of them, five crates!\r  Wait.\r  There are only\r four crates here?\r  Droid?\r  Blast him!\r  Thank you\r for stopping by.\r  Die, you pirate scum!\r  Well, this is fun.\r  - What's the plan?\r - I don't know.\r  Ask the droid.\r  Lando,\r watch out!\r  Hey!\r Get my blaster!\r  Chopper!\r Over here.\r  Uh-oh.\r  I'm rich!\r  I'm dead!\r  Oh.\r  Well, that was easy.\r  Very good.\r  Now!\r  My friend,\r my friend.\r  You might not be\r Calrissian,\r  but I know one thing\r you are\r  You are a Jedi.\r  Why didn't you tell me\r you were a Jedi?\r  You know, I am an old\r Jedi sympathizer.\r  I know. I wouldn't\r believe me either,\r  but one of my best\r friends was a Jedi.\r  I'm pretty sure\r we were friends.\r  Well,\r I'm not really a Jedi yet.\r  Well, then be\r a pirate Jedi!\r  We will make an excellent team.\r  But first, tell me,\r what is your name?\r  Your real name.\r  - Ezra Bridger.\r - Thank you, Ezra Bridger.\r  Well, you must have\r many responsibilities, yes?\r  Yeah, too many\r at the moment.\r  Well, then join my crew,\r  and I will split it right\r down the middle, fifty-forty.\r  You won't get a better deal\r than that, especially from me.\r  Wait,\r that's only 90%.\r  What about\r the other 10?\r  Oh, you want me to spend\r that on expenses, trust me.\r  Okay, well,\r how about 0% for me?\r  I want the generators.\r All of them.\r  You have a deal,\r partner!\r  Ah! This makes me happy!\r  You get\r the generators,\r  and I get you\r for my crew.\r  It is good.\r Let us celebrate!\r  Droid, droid!\r Go to the galley\r  and bring me the most\r expensive drink you can\r  and something\r for my friend.\r  - Uh, yeah, I think I'll go with him.\r - Of course, partner.\r  Don't forget yours!\r  I don't know what\r just happened. Di\r  Did I just\r join his crew?\r  No, no, I don't want\r to leave the Ghost.\r  I I mean,\r not really.\r  Maybe I would make a\r pretty good pirate.\r  Inquisitors don't\r hunt them, do they?\r  What is that?\r  - Vizago!\r - You?\r  What are you\r doing here?\r  II\r  Wait, Hondo told me you\r lost your ship in a bet.\r  Oh! And you believed\r that swindler?\r  By the moons of Gozgo,\r you are hopelessly gullible!\r  Hey, I'm not the one who got\r locked in his own brig.\r  He shot me in the\r back with a stunner,\r  eh, disabled my\r droids somehow.\r  Probably with this.\r  You must help me\r reclaim the Horn.\r  Sorry, but I've got\r other things to worry about.\r  You owe me, remember?\r  I gave you information, and\r it saved your Jedi friend.\r  I am calling in\r that favor Now.\r  I know\r what I said earlier, Chop.\r  Okay, I'll get you your\r ship, and then we're even.\r  Fine with me.\r  Chopper, get the generators\r onboard the Phantom.\r  - My generators?\r - No, my generators.\r  Now, come along\r and behave.\r  I think you two\r know each other.\r  Partner,\r  how could you let this dangerous\r criminal out of the brig?\r  Save it, partner.\r  Let's all relax.\r  I take the generators.\r  You two split\r Azmorigan's credits.\r  - Everyone wins.\r - That is a fair deal. Hmm?\r  - And it disgusts me.\r - For once, I agree.\r  Care to hear\r my counter-offer?\r  Excellent work!\r  I will invest\r your share wisely.\r  Thanks a lot, partner!\r  Keep the Jedi occupied.\r  Wha What could have\r possibly gone wrong now?\r  I'm sorry, very sorry, but\r I do not work with droids.\r  Well, looks like you get\r your ship back, as promised.\r  Yes, but I lost all my\r credits and my generators!\r  Eh, technically,\r they were my generators.\r  I hate children.\r  Not sure how we're\r gonna explain all this.\r  What do you mean you know\r where Hondo will be?\r  Well, wait. I'm not done.\r  Then he let\r Vizago out!\r  The villain was upon\r us, I'm telling you!\r  But young Ezra,\r  he stood tall\r in front of me\r  and withstood\r a massive atta\r  My friend!\r  I was just\r talking about you.\r  How you and I rescued\r the generators\r  from the evil Vizago.\r  Yeah,\r that's not true.\r  You stole the\r generators and my ship.\r  What an accusation!\r  You wound me!\r  Chopper had the\r Phantom on autopilot.\r  Well, that's another version\r of the story, I suppose.\r  I'll tell you what.\r  You can keep\r my generators.\r  They are\r my gift to you.\r  Goodbye!\r  Just so you know,\r at one time,\r  I might have\r joined your crew.\r  You might\r  Oh, Ezra.\r  You truly are\r a Jedi.\r  Contact\r Commander Sato.\r  Tell him Ezra Bridger\r found his generators.\r  So, you went for a little spin?\r  - I was just trying to figure things out.\r - And did you?\r  I used to be\r like Hondo\r  Out for myself\r and alone.\r  But that's not\r who I am anymore.\r  You're on\r a different path now.\r  And I have\r you guys.\r      \n                "}, "Gathering Forces": {"episode": "s01e08", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t  You've passed the first test.\r  Once we'll begin, there's\r no turning back.

Roll away!\r  Open fire. Their shields\r will not hold indefinitely.\r  Sabine, I need you in the nose gun, now!\r  - Didn't you hear Hera?\r - Didn't you hear Tseebo?\r  He said he knows\r what happened to your parents.\r  I already know what happened.\r They're dead. So go!\r  Are they?\r Are my parents dead?\r  Someone want to explain to me\r why we're extra popular tonight?\r  We've picked up a passenger\r  the Rodian the imperials are hunting.\r  And he's important because?\r  Because his cybernetic implant has\r downloaded half the Empire's secrets.\r  Okay, I can see why that's important.\r Let's get him out of here.\r  The Bridgers should hide.\r The troopers came.\r  They took Mira\r and Ephraim Bridger away.\r  Where? Where did they\r take them?\r  Forgive Tseebo.\r  - Forgive him.\r - Forgive you?\r  Tseebo failed.\r Tseebo was afraid.\r  Tseebo could not raise Ezra Bridger.\r  Coward! You could\r have stopped them!\r  Why didn't you stop them?!\r  - Tseebo!\r - Shields down!\r  Ezra, I need you in the cockpit!\r  Yeah. On my way.\r  Forgive you? My parents\r trusted you, and you failed them\r  and you failed me.\r I'll never forgive you for that.\r  Quite a ship.\r  Ezra. Nav-computer's off-line.\r  - With chopper down, I need you to fix it.\r - Not exactly my specialty.\r  Well, make it your\r specialty and make it fast.\r  Or this ship becomes a real ghost.\r  1x08 - \"Gathering Forces\"\r  Could really use that nav-computer!\r  - Rewiring fast as I\r - For fast travel over interstellar\r  distances, hyperspace is optimal.\r  What is he doing?\r  I don't believe it.\r  Hang on!\r  - Uh, Hera. This is Tseebo.\r - And did Tseebo just\r  signal hyperspace\r coordinates directly to my ship?\r  - That would be my guess.\r - Well, then\r  thank you, Tseebo.\r I think you saved our lives.\r  Yeah, I guess there's\r a first time for everything.\r  We are receiving a signal\r from the tracker.\r  They will not be able\r to outrun us for long.\r  I still sense the Jedi and\r his padawan within my grasp.\r  So? Now what\r do we do with him?\r  We have a few ideas.\r  But you're the one\r who has history with Tseebo.\r  What do you think we should do?\r  Don't know.\r Don't much care.\r  Ezra, you'll never\r advance as a Jedi\r  if you can't be honest\r with yourself, at least.\r  What's that\r supposed to mean?\r  It means Tseebo matters to you.\r  You do care\r what happens to him.\r  Why should I? He did\r nothing to save my parents!\r  What could he have done\r against the entire Empire?\r  And besides, look at what\r he's done since. The imperials\r  encourage these implants,\r but they're not mandatory.\r  Not yet.\r He must have volunteered.\r  And then he uploaded\r their secrets and ran.\r  Maybe he's trying to make up\r for letting you down.\r  Why else would he take on\r the Empire alone?\r  Empire \r  He said the Empire\r can track the Ghost.\r  Oh, please.\r  The imperials can't follow\r us through hyperspace.\r  Imperial XX-23 S-thread tracker\r was developed by Sienar systems\r  to trace ships through\r hyperspace to destination.\r  Hera, could they have\r tagged us with that thing?\r  Guess we better find out.\r  Whoa, whoa, whoa.\r Calm down, chop.\r  You were just off-line\r for a few minutes.\r  We need you to scan\r the Ghost for that.\r  Stop grumbling and find that\r tracker, you rust bucket!\r  - So they did tag us.\r - Yes. But the good news is the tracer's\r  - actually on the hull of the Phantom.\r - How is that good news exactly?\r  It'll allow us to detach the Phantom\r  and lure the imperials away\r from the Ghost and Tseebo.\r  Whoa, whoa, whoa! You want to\r detach while in hyperspace?\r  Do you know how incredibly\r dangerous that is?\r  Not as dangerous as what\r I plan to do with the ship.\r  - Can't wait to hear this.\r - I checked our current trajectory.\r  - If you can modify the hyperspace\r coordinates  - I could.\r  then we can pass by the asteroid\r field where the old clone base is.\r  You mean the base with the\r nasties who live in the shadows?\r  Wait, what? Why would\r we want to go down there?\r  He's right, Kanan. Why not just\r drop the Phantom into our trail\r  and let the imperials\r chase after their tracker?\r  Because there's more\r than a tracker at work here.\r  Back on Lothal, I sensed it.\r  The Inquisitor is on our\r trail, and as long as Ezra and I\r  are on board the Ghost, we're\r jeopardizing Tseebo's escape.\r  So I gotta leave the Ghost and\r go to this nasty-filled asteroid\r  - as a favor to Tseebo?\r - As a favor to all of us.\r  And don't worry.\r I'll be right beside you.\r  So your parents\r  - do you really believe they're dead?\r - Yes.\r  No I-I don't know.\r  - Does it matter?\r - Yeah, of course it matters.\r  You have to talk to Tseebo\r before we go.\r  - Tried that already.\r - Okay, so try harder!\r  Once Hera takes him away,\r you may never see Tseebo again.\r  - Maybe that's for the best.\r - Wha ?\r  - How can you say that?\r - Sabine\r  I've been on my own\r since I was seven, okay?\r  If I'd let myself believe\r my folks were alive,\r  if I let myself believe\r they'd come back and save me,\r  I'd never have learned how to survive.\r  You ready?\r  Okay.\r  Strap in.\r  Prepping for separation.\r Once we're out of hyperspace,\r  we'll head towards the asteroid\r base and lead the Empire there.\r  You sure about this?\r  You won't be any more welcome\r there than the imperials.\r  - That's what I'm counting on.\r - Just be safe. And Ezra?\r  - Look out for Kanan.\r - Somebody has to.\r  - Ready for separation.\r - Copy that, Ghost.\r  Five, four\r  three, two\r  one.\r Detach!\r  Okay. Okay.\r  That was the easy part.\r  I sense movement in the Force.\r  Y-Yes.\r  The tracker indicates the rebel\r ship has emerged from hyperspace.\r  - Should we\r - At once.\r  Should we go over the plan again?\r  - I never told you what the plan was.\r - Exactly.\r  You remember the nasty creatures\r Hera and Sabine found here?\r  Yeah. Oh, I'd rather\r forget them, but yes.\r  Well, I'm gonna need you\r to connect with them\r  like I was trying to teach you before\r if we're gonna survive this.\r  Is now really the\r best time for a lesson?\r  No, but I figure it's learning\r like you do best by surviving.\r  Kanan, I can't. I'm afraid.\r  I got news for you, kid.\r  Everyone's afraid, but\r admitting it as you just did\r  makes you braver than most,\r and it's a step forward.\r  Yeah, into the jaws of a nightmare.\r  Okay\r  Okay\r  I'll get the tracking device\r off the Phantom.\r  You go make some new friends.\r Here we go.\r  One with the force.\r One with the force.\r  One with the force.\r I'm one with the force. \r  One with the force.\r One with the force.\r  You're blocked!\r Let go.\r  I can't!\r  Don't be afraid.\r  I'm not afraid of them.\r  - Then what?\r - I don't know.\r  - Yes, you do!\r - I\r  Ezra!\r What are you afraid of?\r  I'm afraid of\r I'm afraid of knowing.\r  I'm afraid of the truth!\r  I'm sorry!\r  I'm sorry.\r I forgive you, Tseebo!\r  I, too, am sorry.\r  Forgive me\r for everything.\r  Fulcrum to Ghost.\r Docking complete.\r  Heading to the airlock now.\r  Acknowledged, Fulcrum.\r We're ready and waiting.\r  I don't suppose Zeb and I could\r get to meet Fulcrum this time?\r  Nope. This time you\r stay in the cockpit.\r  That's what we did last time.\r  - You seem better.\r - Tseebo's mind is clearer now.\r  But it is difficult. There's so\r much information inside Tseebo.\r  Fulcrum's people will help you\r with that and keep you safe.\r  But will Tseebo\r see Ezra Bridger again?\r  I hope so.\r Someday.\r  Is there anything you'd\r like me to tell him?\r  Oh, Tseebo failed Bridgers.\r Did not watch over their son.\r  But Tseebo tried to make it\r right by accessing imperial files.\r  And that intel will be invaluable.\r  Oh, intel unimportant\r an accident.\r  Tseebo access file\r on Ezra Bridger's parents.\r  - Tseebo knows Bridgers' fate.\r - Then tell me, Tseebo.\r  Tell me, and I'll tell Ezra.\r  They're here, all right.\r The rebel ship is inside.\r  Keep them contained.\r I want them alive.\r  Hold formation.\r  Lights up!\r  Steady.\r  Sir, they're over here.\r  Wait. I sense\r  Sir! They're not alone.\r  Shoot it! Shoot it!\r  This was your plan?\r  To lure us here and allow these\r creatures to do your work for you?\r  How do you think it's going?\r  Pathetically.\r  Guess if you want\r something done right\r  Kanan!\r  Your meager training is nothing\r in the face of true power.\r  You're not going near him!\r  I believe I am.\r In fact, it's time to end\r  both Jedi and padawan\r for good.\r  Your devotion to your master\r is admirable,\r  but it will not save you.\r Nothing can.\r  Get back!\r  Ah, yes, good. Go on.\r  Unleash your anger.\r  I will teach you\r what your master could not.\r  You don't have anything\r to teach me.\r  The darkness is too strong\r for you, orphan.\r  It is swallowing you up,\r even now.\r  No!\r  - Your master will die.\r - No!\r  Your friends will die.\r  And everything you've hoped for\r will be lost.\r  This is the way the story ends.\r  No!\r  Ezra? No!\r  - Ezra.\r - Kanan?\r  What happened? I\r I feel so cold.\r  I know. It's okay.\r We're leaving.\r  My master will not be pleased.\r  - I saved us?\r - You did.\r  - But something doesn't feel right.\r - If your will isn't\r  strong enough when you\r open yourself to the force,\r  you become vulnerable\r to the dark side.\r  I was trying to protect you.\r  I know.\r But your anger and fear\r  - caused that giant creature to attack.\r - I don't remember it.\r  That's for the best.\r  Your powers are growing so\r quickly, you weren't prepared.\r  I didn't teach you what you\r needed to know. I'm sorry.\r  Welcome back, you two.\r  You outsmarted them again.\r  - Good job, boss.\r - You made it.\r  - Was there any doubt?\r - Never.\r  Ezra, I have something to\r  Ezra needs a little time\r to himself right now.\r  We need to talk.\r  - Rough couple of days.\r - Yeah. It's been strange.\r  I have just what you need.\r  It's the holo-disk\r from your old house.\r  It was pretty degraded,\r but I cleaned it up.\r  And I found something.\r  Mom?

I lost\r track of him a long time ago,\r  and all my transmissions\r have gone unanswered.\r  We can find him.\r Let us try.\r  Well, there is one option\r I've not yet attempted.\r  Is that the head\r of an old tactical droid?\r  These droids were great at\r finding things, calculating.\r  Found my master and I a few times\r when we didn't want to be found.\r  How in all the galaxy is that\r droid gonna find your friend?\r  Well, I heard he was last seen\r in the Seelos system.\r  You can start there.\r  - You're not coming with us?\r -  I have something else to attend to.\r  The Sith Lord.\r  There are questions,\r questions that need answering.\r  I wish we could go with you.\r  You have\r your own mission, Ezra.\r  And, Kanan, if you find\r my friend, you must trust him.\r  If he's all the things you\r say, we can't afford not to.\r  Trust him.\r  - What was that about?\r - I have no idea.\r   We get all the way\r to Seelos,\r  and now you tell me the hyperdrive\r wasn't completely fixed?\r  You finished\r the important repairs?\r  - How did you define \"important\"?\r - What's going on?\r  Chopper and I\r are staying here.\r  To clean up his mess.\r  Take the Phantom.\r  Hopefully we'll be ready to go\r by the time you get back.\r  Well, let's\r fire this thing up.\r  I think it's scanning\r for a signal of some kind.\r  Good luck. You could really\r get lost out here.\r  Maybe that was the idea.\r  What if this great commander we're\r looking for doesn't want to be found?\r  7567. 7567.\r  - It's homing in on something.\r - 7567.\r  - There. Up ahead.\r - 7567.\r  Whoa.\r  Now that is a work of art.\r  Looks like\r an old Republic tank,\r  used during the Clone Wars.\r  7567.\r  Ezra, be on guard.\r  It's just a bunch\r of old geezers.\r  Well-armed old geezers.\r  - What do you want?\r - We're looking for someone.\r  Well, that's too bad, 'cause\r there's nobody out here.\r  Hey, uh, does the number 7567\r mean anything to you?\r  What did you just say?\r  Uh, I said 7567.\r  I haven't heard\r those digits in\r  Well, that's\r my birth number.\r  Birth number?\r  They're clones.\r  - Kanan, wait. Stop!\r - Jedi. They've come for revenge.\r  Drop the blaster, old man.\r  Don't try it, boyo!\r I'll gun you down.\r  Stand down, troopers. Now!\r  That's an order, soldier.\r  But he's a Jedi. A Jedi!\r  I know. I know.

You're a big one,\r aren't you?\r  Bigger than you.\r  Whoa.\r  Hey, hey.\r Easy with those, son.\r  Oh, yeah, yeah.\r I might move the dust.\r  How is Commander Tano?\r  Uh, well, in need of help.\r We all are.\r  Look, we're trying\r to fight the Empire,\r  but we're outnumbered, overmatched\r and taking a beating.\r  We could use your help.\r  Well, I'm not sure I'm much\r help to anyone these days.\r  Didn't you hear?\r  The Emperor\r said the clone army\r  has outserved its purpose\r and retired us.\r  Now we spend our days just telling\r stories and slinging for joopas.\r  This was a wasted trip.\r  You heard the clone.\r He's not interested.\r  Wait. You don't like\r the Empire, do you?\r  Well, the Empire certainly\r isn't the Republic,\r  but you can't do anything\r about that.\r  - You could fight.\r - Sorry, son.\r  My days as a soldier\r are over.\r  Well, okay. Okay, then maybe there's\r one thing you can help us with.\r  We need a base.\r  Ahsoka said you knew about all sorts\r of secret locations in the Outer Rim.\r  Well, my memory isn't what\r it once was, but, um,\r  there are a few spots I never\r bothered to report to the Empire.\r  Look, why don't you\r wait outside\r  and I'll put together\r a list of coordinates.\r  Listen, they are in\r some kind of trouble.\r  If we help them, we are\r putting ourselves in danger.\r  Wolffe, relax.\r  We got the situation\r under control.\r  Oh, really? Really? What do you\r think the Empire will do to us\r  if they find out that\r we are helping a Jedi, hmm?\r  Yeah, I don't know what the Empire\r would do, but I'm going slinging.\r  You know,\r I was thinking,\r  since we're providing you\r with a list of bases, um,\r  there's something\r you can do to help us.\r  - No, thanks. \r - Sure. What can we do?\r  Out there, deep below,\r roam the joopa.\r  Elusive big game.\r  When we're lucky enough to sling one\r in, it'll feed us for the whole year.\r  Okay.\r What do you need?\r  Him.\r  Huh? What?\r  Commander, we've received a binary\r transmission from an old clone unit on Seelos.\r  - Something about a Jedi.\r T- hat system is remote.\r  Haven't all the clones\r been decommissioned?\r  Yes, and while the clone's \r number checks out,\r  he has a record of calls\r of delusional distress.\r  I wouldn't take him\r too seriously.\r  Send a probe to investigate.\r All leads must be pursued.\r  Okay. You don't trust\r these clones,\r  but they haven't\r done anything.\r  You don't understand.\r They're dangerous.\r  - They could\r - They could what?\r  Rex doesn't seem bad at all.\r  Ahsoka said\r to trust him.\r  You trust her,\r don't you?\r  You weren't there.\r You weren't even born.\r  - What are you talking about?\r - I don't feel like discussing it.\r  It was at the end,\r the end of the war.\r  Our fellow soldiers,\r the clones,\r  the ones we Jedi\r fought side by side with,\r  suddenly turned\r and betrayed us.\r  I watched them kill my master.\r  She fought beside them\r for years,\r  and they gunned her down\r in a second,\r  and then came for me.\r  Later they said they had chips in\r their heads that made them do it.\r  - Said they had no choice.\r - I didn't betray my Jedi.\r  Wolffe, Gregor and I\r all removed our control chips.\r  We all have a choice.\r  Well, for what it's worth,\r I believe we can trust Rex.\r  If we're lucky, we'll\r catch Big Bongo today.\r  Let's get this over with.\r I'm getting hungry.\r  Keep on going forward.\r Just a little bit more.\r  We're coming up\r on a hot spot!\r  Your hot spot looks like everywhere\r else on this desolate rock.\r  Out there.\r  All right, full stop.\r  All right.\r Just a little bit more.\r  Little more.\r  Oh, really?\r  You know, we really\r appreciate this.\r  I mean, we, we should do well\r today, with your friend here.\r  Yeah, well, Zeb packs\r quite a punch.\r  Oh, oh.\r  I'm sure, I'm sure.\r  But really, I mean, joopa\r supposedly love Lasats.\r  They love them?\r What do you mean?\r  Well, they say\r they love the smell,\r  or I guess they love\r the taste as well.\r  And maybe it's about the texture.\r You know\r  Wait, Zeb's not the hunter.\r He's the bait.\r  Oh, hunter, bait,\r it's all the same.\r  No, it's not!\r  Zeb, you better\r get back here right now!\r  - Zeb, what is that?\r - Buddy, run!

Now!\r  That's it!\r That's it!\r  Ooh!\r He didn't like that!\r  Hit him again!\r  He's a runnin'.\r  Hit that line!\r Bring him up.\r  - We're losing the regulator.\r - Full stop, Wolffe!

You almost\r got my friend eaten!\r  Yeah. Ugh. I was\r in that thing's mouth!\r  Oh! Head to toe.\r  But look at you.\r  You brought in\r our biggest catch ever.\r  I I did?\r  Actually, it wasn't\r so bad, Kanan.\r  I I knew I had the\r beast from the beginning.\r  And you are a natural.\r  We held up our end\r of the deal, Captain.\r  Now it's time to get us those\r coordinates so we can go.\r  I'll get 'em.

I got this.\r  You were brave\r today, kid.\r  You jumped right\r in there to help.\r  A great Jedi once told me that the\r best leaders lead by example.\r  You do that well.\r  Thanks. I've learned from\r a great Jedi too. Kanan.\r  Mmm. You know,\r I don't think he likes me.\r  Or ever will.\r  Can't say I blame him.\r  The war left its scars\r on all of us.\r  Won't you reconsider\r joining us?\r  You know, I've outserved my purpose for\r that kind of fighting, I'm afraid.\r  After the war, I questioned\r the point of the whole thing.\r  All those men died,\r and for what?\r  I guess what they thought was right.\r  The clones gave us up. They\r warned the Empire we're here.\r  - Wait, what? \r - You're mistaken.\r  We would never do that.\r  Oh, I found the binary\r transmission to the Empire.\r  And there are messages Ahsoka sent\r to Rex, and he never answered her!\r  What? I never got any\r messages from Commander Tano.\r  I knew it! I told you,\r  - they can't be trusted.\r - Kanan, wait.\r  Is this true?\r  Wolffe.\r What did you do?\r  I I contacted the Empire.\r  If they found out that we were\r helping Jedi, they'd wipe us out.\r  Sabine, go warn Hera. Tell her\r to scan for incoming ships.\r  I wanted to protect you\r guys, protect our squad.\r  The war is over.\r We are free men.\r  We can't live under the fear of the\r Empire for the rest of our lives, Wolffe.\r  That's not freedom.\r  You're right.\r  They're not our enemy.\r I'm sorry.\r  A probe?\r  Kanan!\r  Oh, my.\r  - Look out!\r - Probes! I hate probes!\r  Whoa!\r  Rex.\r  You gotta make this right.\r  Yes!\r  Huh. Nice shot.\r  Whoo-hoo-hoo!\r Rex got him.\r  Probe deserved it.\r  - How long has this thing been watching us?\r - Long enough.\r  - How's the Phantom? \r - Well, engine took a direct hit.\r  We're not going anywhere\r until I can fix it.\r  - Wait.

This\r Empire has no use for weakness.\r  Whoa!\r  Morgan, how do you do it?\r  It's like you know the platforms\r are coming before they're there.\r  What can I say?\r It's a gift!\r  Morgan is impressive.\r  Perhaps too impressive.\r Make a note of that.\r  You lose, Morgan.\r  Jai, look out!\r  First again.\r  - Yeah.

Are you trying to help me?\r  You really want to\r discuss this here and now?\r  Mmm, not so much.\r  Specter-5 to Ghost.\r Something went wrong.\r  The kid didn't get the device,\r and he didn't come out.\r  Copy that, Specter-5.\r Give him one more day.\r  - This decoder better be worth this risk.\r - What's the alternative?\r  Do you want to stop that\r Kyber shipment or not?\r  You know what the Empire\r could do with that crystal.\r  - Nothing good.\r - So we give Ezra one more day.\r  What do you need that decoder for?\r  My friends need it to\r stop an Imperial shipment.\r  - How'd you know about the sensors?\r - From my sister, Dhara.\r  She was the star Cadet in this place.\r  She knew the entire Imperial\r complex backwards and forwards.\r  - What happened to her?\r - Well, they told us she ran off.\r  But I don't believe it. What were you\r doing breaking into Kallus's office?\r  - That's a great way to get shot.\r - Long story, but I need that decoder.\r  And I could use a partner who knows\r  - his way around.\r - What's in it for me?\r  Do you really need a reason\r to mess with the Empire?\r  - No, I don't.\r - Good. We have to finish\r  in the top three tomorrow if we're\r gonna get back inside Imperial H.Q.\r  Then let's do it. I'm Zare,\r by the way. Zare Leonis.\r  - And you're Dev, right?\r - Yeah. Yeah, that's me.\r  Today's assessment will be\r a little more challenging.\r  You will need to shoot the targets\r  to activate the panels\r necessary to climb out.\r  Three, two, one!\r  Oleg seems to have taken your\r correction to heart, Mr. Grint.\r  I'm not gonna make it!\r  Sorry, Jai.\r  Cadets, follow Morgan's example.\r There is no friendship in war.\r  The only thing that matters is victory.\r Victory at any cost.\r  Tomorrow's final trial will\r push all of you to your limits.\r  The reward for success will be a training\r session aboard an Imperial walker.\r  - Dev, you sabotaged me!\r - I did what I had to do.\r  Good to know.\r  How are you gonna\r reach anything from up there?\r  Don't worry. I've been\r training to be a Jedi.\r  Yeah, right. Who isn't?\r  You'll see.\r  Come.\r  Sir, your podracer parts\r have been delivered.\r  If you'll just sign off here,\r I'll bring them up.\r  Obviously, there's been a mistake.\r What would I want with podracer parts?\r  No mistake, sir.\r It says right here\r  two crates of secondhand\r podracer parts\r  for Agent Kallus.\r  I enjoy a good podrace myself, sir.\r  - So were you gonna sign it?\r - Cadet, are you ignorant?\r  - I said this is a mistake.\r - Sir, yes, sir! Sorry, sir.\r  As usual, the assessments\r have proven quite illuminating.\r  I believe we've identified\r two Cadets, Morgan and Kell,\r  that meet your special\r criteria, Inquisitor.\r  Excellent, Commandant.\r  Tomorrow, I will arrive on\r Lothal to test them myself.\r  If the tests are conclusive,\r I will take them into custody.\r  Did you get the decoder?\r  Good. Where's Ezra?\r  What?\r  What do you mean he\r went back to the Academy?\r  Guys, I know you're expecting\r me, but I have to stay\r  at the Academy. There's\r this kid there, Jai Kell.\r  And he'll get scooped up by the\r Inquisitor if I don't help him.\r  Wait. The Inquisitor?\r Is Ezra out of his\r  You probably think I've lost my\r mind. And you're probably right.\r  But it's your fault. The old me never\r stuck his neck out for a stranger.\r  Clearly, I've spent way\r too long with you heroes.\r  Decode the hyperspace coordinates\r and get them to Specter-1.\r  Oh, and if you're not too busy,\r attack the Academy tomorrow at noon.\r  I could use the diversion so I\r can get out of here. Specter-6 out.\r  Specter-5 to Ghost.\r  Sending coordinates\r for Imperial jump route.\r  If you leave now, you should\r still be able to intercept.\r  Coordinates received.\r We're heading out.\r  Good work, Specter-5,\r and you too, Specter-6.\r  Uh, Specter-6 isn't with us.\r  What? Where is he?\r  Specter-5, repeat!\r Where's Specter-6?\r  Kanan, we're out of\r range. All we can do now is\r  complete the mission and\r get back as soon as possible.\r  - Huh?\r - Shh. Come with me.\r  Jai. Trust me. Please.\r  And that's why you need to\r come with us and leave tomorrow.\r  No. No way. This is\r just another dirty trick.\r  You're trying to get me\r busted out of the Academy.\r  Uh, yeah.\r But not the way you think.\r  - The Inquisitor\r - Please. I don't believe this Inquisitor exists.\r  And even if he does, then\r maybe it's a good thing.\r  The Inquisitor trains me.\r I get a top rank in the Empire.\r  - Kell, you got a family?\r - Uh, it's just me and my mother.\r  And how would she feel if\r she never saw you again?\r  My sister disappeared from this place.\r  And I'm betting it was the\r Inquisitor who took her away.\r  So unless you're ready to\r say bye to Mom forever\r  Okay. What's the plan?\r  Simple. The three of us have\r to win tomorrow's challenge.\r  - Not so simple.\r - How's that gonna get us out of here?\r  Because it gets us inside that walker.\r  Kanan, there are three ships.\r  And we'll only get one shot at this.\r  The Kyber crystal\r resonates with the Force.\r  - It's in the middle ship.\r - You sure?\r  I'm sure.\r  Come on. Keep up!\r  Jai, look out!\r  Dev!\r  Keep going.\r  Well, well.\r  Cadets Kell, Leonis\r and Oleg win the day\r  and the prize.\r  You were supposed to be on\r the walker with us. Now what?\r  Stick to the plan.\r I'll find a way to get on board.\r  Come on, boys. Take the bait.\r  - Hera, you're good to go.\r - Copy that.\r  So these control movement and this\r fires the cannons.\r  - But what are these?\r - Gyroscopics. Here, I'll show you.\r  - We're under attack!\r - What was that?\r  My signal.\r  What are you doing?\r  - Guess there's no turning back now.\r - No.\r  Calculate the jump to hyperspace.\r  Have every remaining ship\r buy us the time we need.\r  We are under attack. Repeat, under\r attack. Lower the blast doors!\r  Look! Do something!\r  Commandant! Whoever's controlling\r that walker is part of the attack!\r  This is LRC-01. A rogue\r walker is loose in the Academy.\r  Advance and destroy.\r  - Fire back!\r - I'm trying!\r  Hera, that transport's\r gonna be gone any second\r  and the cargo along with it.\r Take your shot!\r  Calculations complete.\r Commence hyperspace jump.\r  - Hera!\r - I see it! Come on!\r  - Let me in!\r - Look!\r  Morgan's attempting to fight\r off the insurgents single-handed!\r  Whoa!\r  Whoa!\r  Hold on!\r  - Thanks.\r - Don't mention it.\r  Help me! \r We gotta get 'em out.\r  - You guys okay?\r - Yeah. Let's just get out of here.\r  - Wait. Give me that blaster.\r - Uh, sure. Why?\r  - Because I'm staying.\r - What?\r  It's the only way I'll\r ever find my sister.\r  We got bucketheads inbound!\r  I'll keep in touch.\r  Get in!\r  This is a black mark, Commandant.\r  I do not know this boy,\r but this one I know.\r  This is the Padawan I\r encountered on Stygeon Prime.\r  That is Morgan.\r The other was Kell.\r  Cadet Zare Leonis here came very\r close to stopping the escape.\r  He was part of the traitor's\r squad and knew them well,\r  - or thought so.\r - How admirable.\r  Well, Leonis, let's\r take a walk, shall we?\r  I want to know everything\r about your former friends.\r  Jai, we'll take you to your mother,\r but you'll both have to go into hiding.\r  - Yeah, from the Empire. No problem.\r - We'll help with that too.\r  So how was it, kid?\r  Forgot what it was like to be on my own.\r  - You miss it?\r - No grumpy robots, no smelly Lasats\r  It's good to be back.\r  - At ease, Cadet.\r - Sir, yes, sir.\r      \n                "}, "Call to Action": {"episode": "s01e12", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t Ah, Grand Moff Tarkin. I am\r honored by your visit to Lothal.\r  My visit is hardly an honor, Minister.\r  I admit I was surprised\r to learn you were coming.\r  And I, too, have been surprised\r  by what's been happening on\r your little backwater world.\r  If you are referring\r to the insurgents, I\r  In the absence of Governor Pryce,\r  you have had a single,\r simple objective, Minister\r  to protect the Empire's\r industrial interests here.\r  Interests which are vital to our\r expansion throughout the Outer Rim.\r  But instead of protecting those\r interests, you have allowed\r  a cell of insurgents to\r flourish right under your nose.\r  Am I correct?\r  And, Agent Kallus,\r have you just stood idly by\r  while this rabble have attacked our men,\r  destroyed our property\r and disrupted our trade?\r  I have exhausted every\r resource to capture them, sir.\r  This group has proven quite elusive.\r  It's said their leader is a Jedi.\r  Ah, yes. Let us not forget the\r sudden appearance of a Jedi,\r  as if leaping from the\r pages of ancient history.\r  A shame we don't have someone who\r specializes in dealing with them,\r  otherwise our problem might be solved.\r  Minister, have you ever met a Jedi?\r  - No. I\r - I actually knew the Jedi\r  not from the pages of\r folklore or children's tales,\r  but as flesh and blood.\r And do you know what happened to them?\r  Well, there were rumors\r  They died.\r Every last one of them.\r  So you see, this criminal\r cannot be what he claims to be,\r  and I shall prove it.\r  1x12 - \"Call to Action\"\r  Aren't we headed the wrong way?\r  Don't want to lead 'em\r back to the ship. Follow me.\r  They're making for town.\r  Order our units to split up.\r We'll box them in.\r  Gotcha.\r  Stay on 'em.\r I'll cut 'em off.\r  Told you that would work.\r  You're finally getting the hang of this.\r There's hope for you yet.\r  Senator Trayvis, now that you've\r recommitted yourself to the Empire,\r  - will your followers do the same?\r - Most will, Alton.\r  These were good people\r who simply wanted\r  to make the Empire a\r better place peacefully.\r  But I'm afraid these insurgents\r have twisted my message\r  into something violent and frightening.\r Of course, I can't abide that.\r  So I'm personally offering\r a reward for their capture\r  Karabast. Shut it off.\r  Still makes me sick to think that\r Trayvis is working for the Empire.\r  Every time we win, we lose.\r  Well, I have a plan that\r might just even the score.\r  - If Trayvis can do it, we can do it too.\r - What, we're gonna send out\r  some kind of inspirational\r type messages?\r  Exactly.\r  - Exactly.\r - Um, I don't get it.\r  Yeah, Kanan.\r What are you thinking?\r  We can't just send a signal.\r  The Empire would track\r it in half a second.\r  Not if the signal comes\r from one of its own towers.\r  Ah. Now I get it.\r  You-You want to take\r control of an Imperial\r  communications tower, which\r is pretty much impossible,\r  and then you want to use it to send\r a message to the people of Lothal?\r  Not just Lothal. One of those big\r towers can reach a few systems.\r  - That's a crazy plan.\r - That's why you like it.\r  And what would we say in this message?\r  Something the Empire\r never says the truth.\r  We have to let people know\r what it's really like out here.\r  Now, are you in?\r  Count me in.\r  Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko\r  and Taskmaster Myles Grint reporting.\r  Gentlemen. Sit.\r  I understand you have experience\r dealing with these insurgents.\r  Oh, yes, sir.\r  And your efforts have\r been less than successful?\r  W-Well, I, uh\r I wouldn't say\r  Commandant, if your\r efforts had been successful,\r  we would not be having this little chat.\r  Now, when was the\r last activity reported?\r  Sir, we, uh, responded personally\r  to an attack last night in\r one of the outlying towns.\r  - And the details of this attack?\r - Uh, nothing of note.\r  The insurgents stole some supplies\r and escaped on speeder bikes.\r  - No casualties.\r - Ah, but you see, Commandant,\r  there is something of\r note in that report\r  \"no casualties.\"\r  Your rebel cell is more\r principled than others.\r  Others, sir?\r You mean there are other cells?\r  Cells, factions, tribes\r Call them what you will.\r  They lack the one thing that would make\r them a credible threat to the Empire\r  unity.\r  While your cell seems\r uninterested in violence,\r  it does present a specific threat\r the Jedi.\r  We have encountered him, sir,\r and he lives up to their reputation.\r  Oh, I doubt that very much.\r  But I am not concerned with\r his skills as a warrior.\r  I am concerned with what he represents.\r Or perhaps I should say,\r  I am concerned by what you allow him\r to represent by failing to stop him\r  hope.\r  There are whispers of this\r alleged Jedi in the streets.\r  In time, such whispers\r might spark belief\r  in something other than the\r strength and security of the Empire.\r  And that, gentlemen,\r is something I cannot have.\r  Make no mistake.\r  From now on, failure\r will have consequences.\r  Agent Kallus, you will\r dispatch probe droids\r  to every known location\r of insurgent activity on Lothal.\r  We will discover the\r whereabouts of these criminals\r  and we will make examples of them.\r  There it is. The Empire's main\r communications tower on Lothal.\r  It routes comm from every\r Imperial operation on the planet,\r  including the Empire's\r Holonet broadcasts.\r  I got bucketheads\r on the perimeter\r  and at least three anti-ship\r batteries around the base.\r  Not an easy trip to the front door.\r  - Don't underestimate yourself.\r - Sabine, let's be optimistic.\r  Say we get to the front door.\r What then?\r  I-I could upload a data spike\r into the central computer\r  and have that transmitter operational\r in I don't know, five minutes?\r  I said be optimistic.\r  - Five minutes is optimistic.\r - Three is better.\r  Hey. You can have it good\r or you can have it fast.\r  All right. Scan us a holomap\r and let's get out of here.\r  I don't like the look of that thing.\r  Imperial probe droid.\r  - Does it see us?\r - Not yet.\r  - How can you tell?\r - Because we're not dead.\r  We need to move.\r  Um, hate to mention this,\r but where are the bikes?\r  - Next to the road.\r - Right where that thing will see them.\r  Hope somebody's got an idea,\r or this whole plan is shot.\r  I could have blasted it\r and gotten that result.\r  Yeah, but then the Empire\r would suspect something was up.\r  - Good thinking, Padawan.\r - Okay. It's touching when you two bond,\r  but I'm betting that probe\r has friends, so let's move it.\r  Governor, one of our probes\r seems to have found something.\r  We believe these are\r the speeder bikes\r  responsible for the rebel\r activity near Jalath.\r  - Where was this footage taken?\r - Outside the main communications tower.\r  A perfect target for these criminals.\r  We can't risk losing the tower.\r We should reinforce security\r  No. Let them believe they still\r possess the element of surprise.\r  Lure them in, and we shall be waiting.\r  As you wish.\r  Inquisitor, I am giving you the\r opportunity to redeem yourself.\r  Do not disappoint me.\r And remember, I want this Jedi alive.\r  Your faith will be rewarded.\r  If it works, we should be able to use this\r to transmit directly through the tower.\r  - How we doing?\r - Well, Chopper has the spike.\r  We get him into the tower\r and he can upload it\r  right into the computer\r core from any terminal.\r  Stop complaining, bolt-brain.\r You have the easy job.\r  What's the range of this spike?\r  As long as the tower is\r transmitting, we're good to go.\r  Everyone will hear what we say.\r Well, anyone who's listening.\r  Once the spike is\r uploaded, we'll signal.\r  - And I spirit you away in the Phantom.\r - That's the plan.\r  And things always go\r according to plan, right?\r  She's right about that.\r  What's with you?\r  - Nothing.\r - Let's take a walk.\r  What's on your mind?\r  I'm not sure we should\r go through with this.\r  Ezra, you are up to this.\r I know you are.\r  I know that's what you want to think.\r  But look. As much as I wish I\r was like my parents, I'm not.\r  There's something else.\r  My parents spoke out\r and I lost them, and I don't\r  I-I don't want to lose\r you guys, okay? Not over this.\r  Hey. All of us have lost things.\r  And we will take more\r losses before this is over.\r  But we can't let that\r stop us from taking risks.\r  We have to move forward.\r And when the time comes,\r  we have to be ready to\r sacrifice for something bigger.\r  That sounds good, but it's not so easy.\r  It's not easy for me either.\r  My master tried to show me, but I don't\r think I ever understood it until now\r  trying to teach it to you.\r  I guess you and I are\r learning these things together.\r  Okay, Sabine, three minutes.\r  Chopper, install the spike.\r  What? They're here?\r That's impossible.\r  Time's up.\r  Sabine, we got targets\r incoming. Let's move!\r  You said I'd get three minutes.\r  Well, now you get one, so hurry up!\r  Yeah, you and me both.\r  - Go get Zeb.\r - I'm staying right here.\r  No, you're getting Zeb then\r coming back here.

Let's go.\r  Zeb, come on.\r Kanan wants us to move.\r  But I like this gun.\r  - We'll get you another gun!\r - Yeah, I can get another gun.\r  - Not this way.

Our first goal\r is to get inside the hangar.\r  Kalani is a war machine,\r programmed to kill,\r  and he's got the numbers\r and the firepower to do it.\r  Our only chance is to be\r aggressive, surprise him,\r  hopefully put him on the defensive.\r  How many droids do you think he has?\r  KALANI: The last battle\r will begin now.\r  A lot. He has a lot of droids!\r  We've gotta scatter them. Use\r the sword and shield maneuver.\r  Wait. What does that mean?\r  We block, he fires.\r  - Everybody ready?\r - Yep!\r  Let's go!\r  Ezra, get ready to duck!\r  Okay!\r  Now!\r  Again!\r  That scattered 'em!\r Everybody forward!\r  Ezra, form it up!\r  (GRUNTS)\r  We've gotta stay together.\r  The hangar looks clear.\r Let's go.\r  - Wait. That's not how it normally goes.\r - What's wrong?\r  The droids usually keep\r coming, wave after wave.\r  That tactical droid has had a\r long time to think about this.\r  And remember, he wants to win.\r  I'm surprised it means so much to him.\r  Yeah, it means a lot to his programming.\r  It means a lot to mine as well.\r  Your programming?\r  We clones were bred for combat.\r  With few exceptions, there was\r no other way of life for us.\r  We should move.\r  Right, Commander.\r Uh, Kanan.\r  Looks like my friends are doing pretty\r good. You might as well surrender now.\r  I am not programmed\r to comprehend your humor.\r  I'm not joking.\r  Ha, ha, ha.\r  Your Republic friends\r have taken the bait.\r  Send in the destroyers.\r  Incoming!\r  KANAN: Ezra, get back!\r They're too dangerous.\r  Can't advance with\r those destroyers up there.\r  There's no way to breach their shields.\r  Look! That crane!\r  I bet we can use it\r to take out the catwalk.\r  - I'll make a run for it.\r - We'll draw their attention.\r  There's gonna be a lot of fire.\r We'll have to be quick.\r  Ezra, move as fast as you can.\r  You can count on me.\r  Ah, the Jedi have split up,\r as they do 76% of the time.\r  Squad six, advance.\r  Move in!\r  REX: More droids!\r We've gotta take cover.\r  Hey!\r  (GASPS)\r (GRUNTS)\r  Hmm, Chop, where've you been?\r  (GRUNTING)\r  How'd you send a distress signal?\r  (GRUNTING)\r  Mmm! I'm kinda\r in the middle of something.\r  (INSISTENT GRUNTING)\r  Okay, okay!\r  A shuttle!\r It's a good find, Chop.\r  But we're not leaving without Zeb.\r  So you get it running\r and I'll get the others.\r  (GRUNTING)\r  Where is that kid?\r  We're gonna get trapped here.\r  We need to move. Now.\r  No, Rex. Wait!\r  You all right?\r  (CHUCKLES)\r  I'm good. Generation one\r armor always holds up.\r  No ray shields this time.\r  Well, that went just as\r planned, more or less.\r  - I make a pretty good soldier, huh?\r - No. A good soldier follows orders.\r  That plan was based\r on timing and execution.\r  And you took too long!\r  - But Chopper wanted to show me\r - This is not a game!\r  This is life and death!\r  Every move you make\r affects the rest of us.\r  If we're gonna survive this, we're gonna\r do it with strategy and discipline.\r  It's not you.\r  He needs to finish this battle his way.\r  Just like that droid.\r  Rex, get between us!\r  REX: Ezra, incoming!\r  Push and fire, now!\r  (GROANS)\r  It worked!\r  Shield overheated.\r That droid's too old.\r  Huh. Just like me.\r  You okay?\r  Yeah, I'll be fine.\r  (DOOR OPENS)\r  Well, looks like we win.\r  I disagree, Captain.\r  Rex, no! Don't!\r  We didn't win. These droids are\r so old, they malfunctioned.\r  If they hadn't, we'd be goners.\r  The boy is correct.\r  The droid army would have prevailed.\r So, technically, victory is ours.\r  No, it's not! I never really\r thought about it. I never asked.\r  I know the Jedi were wiped out,\r the clones were decommissioned,\r  and the droid army was just shut down.\r  The Clone War ended, but why?\r  If none of you won, who did?\r  ZEB: Uh, the Empire.\r  Zeb, that's right!\r  How did you know?\r  Because they're here,\r  and they're about to win again.\r  I've got a new calculation for you.\r  What are the chances your droid\r army can defeat the Empire?\r  My resources are depleted.\r  However, the droid army is not currently\r at war with the Galactic Empire.\r  You wanna bet?\r  - Unit B1-268, analyze the threat.\r - Roger, roger.\r  Move in.\r  (WEAPONS COCKING)\r  Is that what I think it is?\r  Greetings.\r I am unit B1-268.\r  My commander has sent me\r  - to report your intentions.\r - Yeah. Clone Wars battle droid.\r  - Surprised its battery hasn't run out.\r - Um, are we\r  Don't see many of these anymore.\r  Oh, no. And when you do,\r there's usually a bunch of them.\r  All right, you know the drill.\r  Greetings.\r  (SCREAMING)\r  Oh, my\r  I think we face a common enemy now.\r  Ah, wait a minute!\r  Let him finish, Captain.\r  Clones? Battle droids?\r You destroyed each other.\r  And when you were both weak\r enough, the Empire took over.\r  General, what were\r the Separatists fighting for?\r  According to my programming,\r  freedom from the tyranny of the Republic.\r  Hmm, fighting tyranny.\r  Sounds like the Empire\r has always been your enemy.\r  You are against the Empire.\r I am against the Republic.\r  Now the Republic has become the Empire.\r  I accept your logic.\r  - We are on the same side.\r - Sorry.\r  I guess we are.\r  However, as I stated, my\r forces are too depleted\r  for me to plan a\r successful counterattack.\r  Fighting insurmountable odds?\r  We can help you with that.\r  (AGITATED GRUNTING)\r  Yes, Chopper, we know the Empire is here.\r  How's the shuttle coming?\r  Shuttle? What shuttle?\r  The one I tried\r to tell you about earlier.\r  We have three Sheathipede-class\r shuttles, but they have no weapons.\r  No, but they can get us outta here.\r  A successful retreat is improbable.\r  The walkers will destroy the ships\r before they escape the hangar.\r  We don't have the firepower\r to take on walkers.\r  What about the bombs we came here for?\r  We have no cannon to fire the shells.\r  Otherwise, I would have used them on you.\r  Oh, thanks.\r  - We're running out of time!\r - REX: Ah, we roll 'em!\r  The proton bombs. We roll\r 'em across the hangar\r  and into the feet of the walkers.\r  Then we blast 'em!\r  My battle droids are not accurate.\r  However, you are, Master Jedi.\r  I don't understand.\r  My droids will line up and fire\r at you and your apprentice.\r  You two will then redirect\r their blaster bolts\r  toward the shells more accurately,\r  thus setting off more targets\r than my droids could hit alone.\r  Well, this takes trust\r to a whole new level.\r  (SIGHS)\r  Chopper, get the munitions ready to roll.\r  REX: Ready, Zeb?\r  (SIGHS) One last glorious day\r in the Grand Army of the Republic.\r  Chopper, have the shuttle ready to go!\r  KANAN: D squad, get ready!\r  I have never attempted\r such a desperate strategy.\r  That's why we always won.\r  Not always.\r  Hey, guys, focus on the present.\r  Once those shells explode,\r get to your shuttles.\r  BOTH: Roger, roger.\r  (BEEPING)\r  Now!\r  Fire.\r  This might be our only chance.\r Get to the ships!\r  I made it!\r I made it!\r  Aaah!\r  Lead shuttle, bank right!\r  Bank right!\r  We made it!\r General, do you read us?\r  Affirmative. We have\r survived the battle.\r  It was not a victory, but a\r successful strategy nonetheless.\r  No, it was a victory.\r  We all just won the Clone War,\r  and you ended it, Ezra.\r  A galaxy of senators couldn't do that.\r  An army of Jedi, clones and droids\r couldn't find the middle ground,\r  but you did.\r  Rex, all I did was point out that\r none of you were meant to win.\r  - You couldn't.\r - And we needed to hear it.\r  KALANI: Agreed.\r  I am satisfied if you are, Captain.\r  I am.\r  Very good.\r  Now, based upon this battle,\r  I calculate that you have less\r than a one percent chance\r  of staging a successful\r rebellion against the Empire,\r  so this is where we must part ways.\r  Roger, roger.\r  I can't imagine fighting that\r many droids all the time.\r  (CHUCKLES) Well, if you\r think that was bad,\r  let me tell you about\r the Battle of Geonosis.\r  HERA: (ON COMLINK) This is Ghost to\r away team. Spectre-1, are you there?\r  Hera, I was just about to call you.\r  How was your day?\r  We're tracking two shuttles\r leaving the system.\r  Is everything all right? Did you\r have trouble securing the bombs?\r  Well, the bad news is,\r we didn't get the bombs.\r  The good news is, we don't need a pickup\r because we found a new Phantom.\r  Tell Sabine she's gonna need a paint job.\r      \n                "}, "The Forgotten Droid": {"episode": "s02e17", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThanks to Rex's Old Republic map\r  and the map Zeb's Lasat friends made,\r  I believe we finally have a\r suitable location for our base.\r  The Yawst system.\r  There's no sign of the Empire,\r  but there's a small habitable moon,\r  one that I think will provide\r everything you need.\r  Promising, but Yawst\r is several parsecs away,\r  and our carrier does not have enough\r fuel to complete the journey.\r  We can't afford to leave it\r unguarded and immobile.\r  Well, I've been tracking\r Imperial fuel shipments.\r  There's one scheduled to arrive\r at the Horizon Base soon.\r  Eh, it's risky.\r  The Empire's tightened security\r at all its depots in the sector.\r  If there's fuel there,\r what choice do we have?\r  (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA)\r  All right.

Quite clever.\r  You respect them, even though they\r represent your constant failure?\r  Perhaps, Inquisitor, we can achieve\r together, what we have not apart.\r  Admiral, deploy\r the fleet to Garel.\r  - Mom, Dad, I will find you.\r - Ezra.\r  What is that?\r  It's a list\r of Imperial prisoners.\r  The Empire's deleted their names\r and images to keep them secret.\r  - Where'd it come from?\r - Commander Sato.\r  He knows of my interest\r in Imperial prisons.\r  His contact in the Core\r intercepted a report,\r  there was a mass\r escape last night.\r  That's why I had the vision.\r  My parents were\r a part of this.\r  - Possibly.\r - They were! I know it.\r  We've got to find them.\r  How do we find them?\r  I know an old Jedi trick\r that might be able to help.\r  I can't guarantee\r this will work.\r  You have to open your mind to the\r truth as the Force presents it.\r  That can mean something\r good or something bad.\r  Do you understand?\r  Yes. I understand.\r  Turn around\r and focus on the list.\r  Don't try to see\r what you want to see.\r  Let the Force\r be your guide.\r  Stay in the moment,\r be in this place at this time.\r  Stop.\r  Prisoner X-10.\r  Whoever this is, they were\r arrested on Lothal for treason.\r  - You might be onto something.\r - Maybe.\r  We have to find out.\r  Hang on. They could\r be anywhere by now.\r  No, Kanan. Not anywhere.\r  Lothal. That's why I keep\r seeing the white Loth-cat.\r  Where's my helmet?\r I I need my helmet.\r  We want you to find\r your parents, Ezra,\r  but even if you're right, you\r can't go now. We need a plan.\r  The entire Imperial sector fleet\r has the planet in a blockade.\r  Um, not anymore.\r  Been listening in\r on Imperial chatter.\r  Wait. What's up on Lothal?\r  The Empire's fleet left\r Lothal's orbit this morning.\r  Left Lothal? Where to?\r  Doesn't matter, okay?\r This is a sign.\r  I'm supposed to go.\r  Where's my stupid helmet?\r  I know you have to go, but that\r doesn't mean you have to go alone.\r  We support you.\r We're family.\r  Speaking of family,\r where are the delinquents?\r  Back to Lothal?\r  Well, that sounds like\r a terrible idea.\r  Besides, we haven't finished\r getting our supplies.\r  - You can finish later.\r - Just get back here now.\r  Not too fast, Zeb. We don't want\r to alert any Imperial patrols.\r  Don't worry.\r Not a bucket head in sight.\r  In fact, we haven't\r seen one all morning.\r  Kind of strange, actually.\r  It's not strange.\r It's strategy.\r  What are you talking about?\r  The Empire always pulls back\r patrols before a major strike.\r  Oh, no.\r  Well, Ezra, if you want\r to go back to Lothal,\r  now would be the time.\r  Zeb, get back to the ship.\r  I'll contact\r Commander Sato. Hurry.\r  Hera? You copy? Hello?\r  I wonder what\r she was trying to say.\r  I think I know\r what she was gonna say.\r  Sabine, see if you can splice their\r jamming signal. We'll need our comm.\r  - On it.\r - You two better get going.\r  - Not until we get Zeb and Chop.\r - Just have us ready to fly.\r  Zeb, we'll cover you!\r Head this way!\r  Go! Go! Go!\r  Chopper!\r  Got us in a cross fire!\r  We have them pinned.\r  We don't have all day.\r  - We have to get back to Lothal!\r - Ezra, no!\r  Well, that's\r pretty impressive.\r  Yeah. I taught him.\r  Well. Hello there.\r  You are not going\r to get in my way.\r  Well, then, my brave, young\r boy, come and prove it.\r  Ezra!\r  Argh.\r  Ezra, I know how important\r getting to Lothal is.\r  No, Kanan. Actually, you don't\r know what this is like.\r  You're right.\r  I never knew my parents.\r  - Kanan, I I'm sorry.\r - No. It's okay.\r  It's too late for me, but\r maybe not for you.\r  It's gonna be too late for all of us\r if we don't get back to the Ghost.\r  All right. Come on. We'll\r take the long way around.\r  Way to have\r our backs, Chopper.\r  - Sabine, where's my comm?\r - Almost got it.\r  Hangar 16 has fallen.\r Phoenix Squadron, report!\r  Ghost to Liberator.\r Give me some good news.\r  We read you, Hera.\r  If the fleet's gonna launch,\r it's gotta be now.\r  We are employing escape plan\r delta, Captain Syndulla.\r  Are you ready?\r  - They're back.\r - Let's go.\r  This is Phoenix Leader.\r All ships,\r  angle deflector shields\r and follow my lead.\r  Copy that, Captain Syndulla.\r  Admiral, several rebel ships\r have launched.\r  Prepare tractor beam.\r  - Zeb, get on the guns.\r - On my way.\r  Come on, kid. We gotta go.\r You too, Chopper.\r  Target their command ship.\r  They've slinged us\r in a tractor beam.\r  Kanan, I'm\r going back for Sato and Rex.\r  You've got your opening.\r Take it.\r  We're not leaving\r until the fleet is safe.\r  I appreciate the sentiment, but I\r gave you an order. Now get moving.\r  And, Ezra, I hope you find\r what you're looking for.\r  Don't worry. She was\r looking after everyone\r  long before\r you and I came along.\r  This is not escaping.\r This is attacking.\r  - I'm open to suggestions.\r - I've got an idea.\r  But it means getting close\r to that Star Destroyer.\r  We can use the torpedoes\r to take out the tractor beam.\r  - Wait, can we do that?\r - We're gonna find out.\r  Oh, boy.\r  Sir, a second rebel ship\r is attacking our flank.\r  Let the fighters\r deal with it.\r  Keep your focus on\r capturing the command ship.\r  Commander\r Sato, we're going\r  to break you free\r from the tractor beam.\r  Phoenix Leader, I gave you\r a direct order to retreat.\r  Just be ready\r to hit your thrusters.\r  Almost got it.\r Almost got it.\r  Oh! Don't got it!\r Don't got it!\r  I'll get it.\r  What are you doing?\r What are you doing?\r  - Did we get it?\r - We got it.\r  Commander, we're free.\r Get us out of here, now.\r  So, are we rendezvousing with\r the fleet or heading to Lothal?\r  We stay with the fleet.\r  Admiral, Agent Kallus would like\r to know the enemy's position.\r  So would I.\r  You have to admit,\r  it's good to see no Star Destroyers\r over Lothal, for a change.\r  Why so quiet?\r  Thank you for everything\r you've done for me.\r  You're always there\r when I need you most.\r  Hey. I know what it's like to lose\r someone close and not have anyone.\r  When I lost my master,\r I was alone.\r  Regardless of\r how this turns out,\r  I didn't want you to be.\r  So? Where do we start?\r  Home.\r  They burned it to the ground.\r  I guess the Empire wanted\r to send us a message.\r  But my vision led me\r back here to Lothal.\r  If my parents aren't here,\r where are they?\r  What happened to them?\r  Slow down. The Force is\r trying to tell you something.\r  Listen to it.\r  The white Loth-cat.\r  Here. Nice Loth-cat.\r  Good Loth-cat.\r  I'm not here to hurt you,\r but you know that, don't you?\r  Who do you belong to?\r  After it!\r  And we're chasing\r Loth-cats now.\r  Fast little fuzzball.\r  Karabast!\r  Hey!\r  Hey, stop! Stop!\r Wait! Stop!\r  Will you be more careful?\r  You know there are still\r stormtroopers around.\r  Don't worry, okay?\r I can track it.\r  What? The The cat?\r  You've grown powerful if you can\r track that Loth-cat with the Force.\r  The Force? I planted a\r tracker on it, Kanan.\r  Of course you did.\r  The locator stopped up\r ahead in the mountains.\r  This is it.\r  Something familiar\r about this.\r  Hey. Our friend\r from the market.\r  Get down!\r  It's him. X-10?\r  Hold your fire!\r We're friends!\r  Yeah, that'll do it.\r  That isn't my\r name, bounty hunter.\r  I know that's not your name.\r  - Ezra, no!\r - My name is Ezra.\r  Ezra Bridger.\r  I don't know you, but I think\r you might know my parents.\r  Ephraim and Mira Bridger.\r  My name is Ryder Azadi.\r  You're right.\r I know your parents.\r  I can't believe\r you're here, Ezra.\r  I wanted to find you,\r  but I guess\r you found me first.\r  I know you, don't I?\r  Uh, you remember?\r  You were pretty small\r back then.\r  I was the governor of Lothal.\r  I supported your parents\r and the messages\r  they beamed out\r against the Empire.\r  It was part of the reason\r I was accused of treason\r  and sent to prison with them.\r  I do remember. Then you\r know what happened to them.\r  Yes, I do.\r  I'm sorry, son. They are.\r  Please tell me what happened.\r  your parents would stand up\r for those who couldn't.\r  Especially after\r they heard your message.\r  Yes. That message.\r  That message of rebellion\r you beamed out\r  somehow made its way into the\r deepest dark of Imperial prisons.\r  They were\r inspired by it, Ezra.\r  They rallied others\r to rise up and break out.\r  Dozens of us, rebels, sympathizers\r are free, thanks to them.\r  But they didn't make it.\r  They got separated\r in the escape.\r  It was just like them not to leave\r until everyone else got out first.\r  But by then,\r it was too late.\r  How? How did they know\r it was me?\r  On the transmission?\r  Your voice, your words, son,\r telling Lothal to stand up.\r  They knew right away.\r  You know,\r they used to say it\r  all the time\r when I was little.\r  \"If we don't stand up,\r who will?\"\r  It's beautiful, isn't it, son?\r  Yeah. So peaceful.\r  That is all going to change\r when the Empire arrives.\r  But I don't want things\r to change.\r  They already have, Ezra.\r  You have made us\r so proud.\r  You are going to need\r to stay strong.\r  - Can you do that, son?\r - Yes, I can.\r  Remember, Ezra. Without\r hope, we have nothing.\r  Be morning soon.\r  I saw them, Kanan.\r My parents.\r  I I can't explain how.\r  The Jedi teach that life\r doesn't cease at death,\r  Your parents are alive\r inside you, Ezra.\r  They will be.

I'm sorry.\r  You must have heard something.\r  Even if I did know something,\r it would be of no use to you.\r  The Empire is locking everything down.\r  That's bad for you\r and bad for business.\r  Well, if you want to change\r that, you need to help us.\r  I doubt that.\r  In fact, I think your activities\r got the Empire's attention\r  and have made things\r more difficult for me.\r  Get out of here.\r You're bad luck.\r  Ever wonder why the Empire\r was so interested in Kanan,\r  why they'd send an Inquisitor to Lothal?\r  - Ezra, don't.\r - No, please do.\r  Because Kanan is a Jedi.\r  Kanan?\r  A Jedi?\r You're funny, kid.\r  That scoundrel couldn't be\r a Jedi any more than you could.\r  You?\r  - You are a Jedi?\r - And so is Kanan.\r  So what does this mean for Vizago?\r  It means you help me, and you'll\r have a Jedi owing you a favor.\r  Hmm.\r Whatever I ask?\r  - Within reason.\r - No deal.\r  Okay, okay, okay.\r Whatever you ask.\r  All right, come with me, boy.\r Alone.\r  - So start talkin'.\r - First, the deal.\r  Hey!\r What's the matter with you?\r  - I bow, you bow, then we have deal.\r - Oh, right.\r  Yes, okay.\r  Okay, okay, whatever.\r You're overdoing it.\r  Eh, look, since you blew up\r the Empire's comm tower\r  - That wasn't us.\r - Well, you probably know\r  they have no long-range communications,\r  so they've started using these.\r Droid couriers.\r  They take data from the city up to\r their communications ship in orbit.\r  - What kind of data?\r - Everything.\r  You name it personnel,\r weapons, deployments,\r  - prisoners.\r - Kanan?\r  Possibly, but I can't guarantee that.\r  - That's pretty typical for you.\r - Hey, a deal is a deal.\r  A deal is a deal.\r So what do you need?\r  Hmm. Today, nothing.\r  Tomorrow, who knows?\r  I'll let you know\r when I want to collect.\r  It's okay, guys. I have a lead.\r  - Whoa!\r - For what you just bargained,\r  you better have something\r more than just a lead.\r  - Hera, I know you're mad, but\r - Mad? Try furious.\r  You just put all our lives in jeopardy.\r  I give you a direct order,\r and you disobeyed me.\r  Well, it paid off. I know how\r to find out where Kanan is.\r  - Maybe.\r - Maybe?\r  - All that for \"maybe\"?\r - Uh-oh.\r  Hera, none of us want\r to give up on Kanan.\r  And you think I do?\r  No, I don't.\r That's why I took this risk.\r  Okay.\r What did you learn?\r  I have a plan, and it involves Chopper.\r  I'm betting that's the\r shuttle the Empire's using\r  to get the courier\r droid to their comm ship.\r  Our only chance is to intercept the\r droid before it boards the shuttle.\r  The only way to be sure is\r to grab the Imperial droid\r  and send Chopper in its place.\r  Come on, Chop.\r I'll give you a paint job.\r  The Empire won't know the difference.\r  For Kanan.\r  The Jedi is no good to me dead.\r  His resistance is impressive.\r  Yes. He does possess\r the will of a Jedi of old.\r  Is it possible\r  he does not know of any\r other rebels to speak of?\r  Perhaps.\r  I recommend we transfer him\r from Lothal to another location.\r  One that never fails\r to extract a confession.\r  - Behind you!\r - Ha, I'm not gonna fall for\r  Ah.\r  I know you can do this, Chopper.\r  There's the courier.

Oh, I don't fly.\r  Too dangerous.\r  But theoretically,\r it should fly.\r  Theoretically?\r  Better to be down here\r wishing I was up there\r  than up there\r crashing back down here.\r  If that ship crashes,\r I'll toss you over the side,\r  and see how well you fly!\r  Hera!\r  - Yes!\r - Yes!\r  Let's see\r what this beast can do.\r  Definitely not a freighter.\r  That's it.\r  Masterful.\r  Commencing weapons test.\r  I was kind of hoping your ship\r packed more of a punch, Quarrie.\r  Did you pull\r the big lever on the right?\r  - No.\r - Try again.\r  Yay, I told you.\r  Your ship certainly has\r the firepower we need,\r  but the targeting system\r could use some work.\r  I've got some ideas.\r  No, no.\r That's my ship, young one.\r  Just what do you think\r you're doing?\r  Never get between a Mandalorian\r and a weapons package.\r  It's Kanan.

Hang on, Zeb.\r Easy.\r  There must be\r a way to solve this.\r  Oh, it's a shame I had BeeGee install\r that other hyperdrive on the Phantom.\r  You what?\r  I don't like seeing\r a ship that can't fly.\r  During the repairs,\r I upgraded it,\r  because if you don't have\r a hyperdrive, you can't fly far.\r  You beautiful, crazy\r Mon Calamari!\r  That's the answer\r to our problem.\r  What? What's the answer?\r  Sir, enemy ships are\r approaching from sector nine.\r  Scan the rebel ships.\r  The one which carries the relief\r supplies will be our primary target.\r  Initiating scan now, sir.\r  Command ship,\r I'll follow your lead.\r  Hopefully we can break through their\r line and make a run for the surface.\r  Whose idea\r was this again?\r  Sir, comscan has identified the\r Corellian VCX as the supply transport.\r  Of course.\r  Commander, focus all fire\r on the Ghost.\r  Fighter incoming.\r  Rex, keep those TIEs\r off our back!\r  Workin' on it!\r  Better pick up the pace.

If there's\r anything left of him.\r  Sir, rebel reinforcements\r have arrived.\r  One shuttle and one ship\r of unknown design.\r  I would hardly call that\r reinforcements.\r  You boys better\r give me some room.\r  You heard the captain.\r  Sabine, we'll get\r one shot at this.\r  Then it's a good thing\r you trust me.\r  Sir, the unidentified ship\r is taking the lead.\r  It's moving into attack position\r off our starboard side.\r  Steady.

Moralo Eval, mastermind of a Separatist plot to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine, has been captured by Republic forces! But even with the criminal behind bars, rumors swirl in the underworld of Coruscant that Moralo's plot has already been set in motion With precious time running out, the Jedi Council hatches their own plot to keep the Chancellor safe. So what's the big rush? The Jedi Council has called an emergency meeting. I can see it now. Another long, boring debate. Would you rather they call you in to train younglings? Are you crazy? Any idea where that shot came from? A sniper. I see him up there! All right, here's the plan. Anakin, you flank him on the right. Ahsoka, you cover the lower streets. I'm going after him. I lost him! Obi-Wan, do you have anything? - Obi-Wan! - I got him, go! How is he? Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan! I'm worried about Anakin. He hasn't said a word since it happened. Wow. I want to check his midi-chlorian count. What's your pleasure? Shot of your finest. So what's the big deal? I'm celebrating. The death of a Jedi. I killed Obi-Wan Kenobi! Having second thoughts, Master Yoda? Hmm, heading down a dark path, we are. We talked about this. Killing a Jedi was the best move we had. Hmm. So, how was my funeral? A better performance than you, your corpse gave. Whatever do you mean? I fell from the top of a building. I could have killed myself. Survived worse, you have. Young Skywalker knows this. I took the vitals suppressor as instructed. I was dead to the world when Anakin moved my body. There's no way he could know I was alive. Not know. But sense, he will, that something is not right. Keeping Anakin on the outside was critical. Everyone knows how close we are. It was his reaction that sold the sniper. I'm sure of it. What's done is done. We need to get your transformation underway. Well, time for a shave! Tell me about my target. His name is Moralo Eval. Works directly for Count Dooku. Rumor is their plot will be hatched in three revolutions at the festival on Naboo. We tried to make a deal with Moralo for more details, but he was uncooperative. Any details that might help me gain his trust while in prison? Eval killed his mother when he was only a boy. Told the authorities he did it because he was bored. Hmm, I'll try not to bore him. Not a game is this, Obi-Wan. The risks, great they are. Yes, and so are the rewards. Besides preventing Eval from abducting the Chancellor, he could lead us to Grievous, and possibly Dooku himself. Facial transformation program loaded. I take it there's no way to have the Chancellor pull out of the festival? No. See it as a sign of weakness, he would. Sign of weakness. Wouldn't want that. Transformation initiated. This cantina is a bust. Do you want to go to the next one? Rako Hardeen? Who wants to know? Your employer has your payment. Please follow me. Round for the house! Yes! Oh, yeah! This way. Inside if you please. Well done, Mr. Hardeen. You did precisely the job we hired you for. We have your credits right here. But first we need one more thing Your clothes. What the I still don't understand. Did Master Yoda say how they found the sniper? Who cares. All that matters is they did. So I took off in my speeder, and then I got a ride here. That's it. Keep talking. Into this. This is stupid! Confessing to a murder I didn't even do! Oh, but you did For all intents and purposes, Obi-Wan Kenobi is dead. And that certainly was your intention. How do I look? Like a criminal. Should buy you all the credibility you need in prison. Look, I don't know what you guys are up to, but Do we have enough recording? I believe so. Which means you can go to sleep now. So how does this vocal emulator work? Well, you swallow it. I was afraid you'd say that. What an odd sensation. It will take some getting used to. That's a luxury you don't have. I hope this works. Where is Rako Hardeen? Back room. Is he dead? He's about to be. A Jedi? I already killed a Jedi today. Let me sleep. He's not dead. He's drunk. Get up, you filth! If it was up to me I would kill you right here! But lucky for you, the man you murdered would rather see you rot in jail. Now, let's go, you coward, before I change my mind. You should be expecting this scum. Yes, sir. Let me know if he's any trouble. I'd be happy to straighten him out. That's him! Kenobi's killer! Rako Hardeen. He doesn't look so tough. He killed a Jedi. That's him? That's the Jedi killer? He doesn't look so tough. You don't look so tough to me. This food tastes terrible. Maybe you'd taste better. Hey, what's going on down there? Sorry, just playing with my food. You're crazy! Rako Hardeen. Your reputation precedes you. I'm curious, when you killed that Jedi, was it for money or revenge? I don't know. Guess I was bored. Try the sauce. It makes that slop almost tolerable. I'll be seeing you, Mr. Hardeen. Here you go, Hardeen. Home, sweet home. What a coincidence. No coincidence. I am Moralo Eval, and I have great influence here. What do you want from me? A man like you There's bigger game than Jedi, if you've got the guts. I'm listening. It's a brilliant plan if I do say so. And it involves the Chancellor. If I'm breaking out this goon along with us, it'll cost you. Double my rate. Rako Hardeen, meet Cad Bane. Who you calling a goon? Any imbecile can kill a Jedi with a lousy sniper blast. You want my respect? You do it face-to-face. Who said I want your respect? Make that triple my rate. Oh, what a shame. Seems this cell isn't big enough for the three of us. Guard! It's been a pleasure chatting with you, Hardeen. But you will forget everything you heard in here, or Moralo Eval will have you slaughtered. We were just leaving. This is Ben. I found the transmitter, but I shall have to make this short. We have a problem. I made contact with Eval. He nearly divulged his kidnap plot, but Cad Bane stopped him. Cad Bane? We had no intel they were in league together. It appears Eval's hired Bane to break him out of prison, and the way they were talking, it's imminent. Foolish we were, to believe Bane's capture was without purpose. Yes. Yes, but we can make this work for us. If they do try to escape, I won't let them out of my sight. No doubt he shall lead us to some answers about the plot and possibly to his superiors. Good idea, Obi-Wan. Just don't blow your cover. It could take a while to extract you from prison. Not to worry. I'm starting to enjoy playing the villain. Gotta go! Hey, Hardeen! You owe me something. Oh, do I? You don't even remember me? That's very insulting. Look, kid, I don't want any trouble. You stole a bounty from me, and I want an apology! Kill him, Hardeen, like the Jedi! What's wrong, Hardeen? Lose your spine? - You don't want to do this. Kill him! Oh, yes, I do. I warned you. All right, all right, that's it! Fight's over! No, it ain't! You got a problem with Boba, you got a problem with me! All right, that's enough, big fella! - Fight! - Let's get them! Let's get them! Riot! Get the guards! Get 'em! Yeah! We need reinforcements in here. Now! Kill the guards! Riot! Riot! What do we do? Part of my plan. Paid off the kid to create a diversion. Let's go. Facility on lockdown. Facility on lockdown. Facility on lockdown. Turn your weapons off stun! Kill the prisoners if you have to! Hey, wait for me. No one invited you. He killed a Jedi. He could be helpful. Fine. We're wasting time. Uh, I'm telling you, it's gonna be a long night. This is our way out of here. The morgue? This is your brilliant plan? Not the first time I've broken out of this stink hole. The lock has changed. Your plan has failed. Shut up! Let me think. I can get us inside. I'll re-wire the access port on this door. It'll take some time, so warn me if anyone comes. Make it quick. We're in! All the riot casualties are sent to the crematorium. From there it's an easy escape. Another night, another riot. The guards are coming back. You said it, partner. I'll take blasting clankers any day over this. Yeah, me too, give me droids over this prison scum. After what just happened up there, we'll need more room in here. You can say that again. Here, I'll send these to the cremation center. Hey, wait, it looks like a couple of them are showing vital signs. All right, I'll check it out. What's the matter with you? My blaster jammed. Let's go! Soon as we're off Coruscant, we're safe. That's for hesitating during the escape. If it wasn't for me, we'd still be stuck in there. Yeah, funny how that worked out. Hey, my ship! Come back here! You did well in there, Hardeen. Maybe there's a place for you in my plans after all.

They're not Jedi. Do me a favor. Spark up that lightsaber, would you? Mm-hmm. Well, the droids that got attacked said that theirs were red. They are Sith, and we need to find them before they strike again. Well, they took my cargo ship. The droid survivor said they heard something about the Sertar sector. What is in the Sertar sector? That's where Florrum is. You've been there? What can we expect? Pirates. Get me a readout on that ship. There are life-forms aboard. The main reactor and hyperdrive generator are down.

And now these two horned men show up. Who are these horny-headed maniacs? They don't seem like normal Jedi. Not Jedi, Hondo, Sith. We tracked them here. They just threatened to attack with a group of my men my own men! Yes, we are looking at them right now, a cargo vessel and three of your starships. They are heading toward you, Hondo. Dadada, more to the point, are you going to help me when you get here? There's nothing we can do about your men, but we can certainly do something about the Sith. Good. I'll deal with my men. You deal with those tattooed crazies. Right. Well, that settles it. Those traitors are no longer my men. I want their tongues! The Jedi, brother, they've found us. No, it's too soon. My plan isn't finished yet. Too soon. Throwing in with pirates now? Oh, how the mighty Sith have fallen. Ah! No. I have plans, Kenobi, and you will not stand in my way this time. No! Kenobi, this way! Take this cannon down to the hole. We will ambush those traitors there. Where are the rest of your men? They are setting up an ambush. We can use your help. Where is the other Jedi? She's she's dead. She's d They are too powerful for even you? I am semi-speechless. I think they went this way. Let's go down this hall here. I shall draw the brothers away. Once that's done, blast the passageway closed. And leave you alone with the two crazies? Well, okay. Retreat! Retreat! Do not let them escape! Now! Surrender. We are two, and you are no match for us both. You are mistaken. Are you still willing to fight me? The horned men aren't interested in helping you. They are only interested in Kenobi. They promised us wealth and power, boss. Please forgive us. Please don't kill us. We beg of you. Kill you? Oh, I would not kill you. Everyone, the horned men's ship is filled with valuable goods. As your restored leader, I say we celebrate our reunification. To the landing pad! Right, Hondo, right! Savage! Come, my apprentice. This plan has failed, but we will have another opportunity. Jiro, ready the men! We're leaving. My men aren't going anywhere with you. Look at them. How powerful can they be? They are running away from Kenobi. Filth, you will pay for your insolence. Insolence! We are pirates! We don't even know what that means. Open fire! If we kill those two, their riches will be ours! Our engines have been compromised. Get to the escape pod. It's too late. Trust me, apprentice. Well, Kenobi, let's get out there and see what riches have fallen from the sky for me and you. Shall we? Very well. There's no sign of those two, boss. Well, if the condition of these goods is any indication, ah, your friends have been vaporized. I wouldn't be so sure. I cut one of them in half once, and he survived. Well, isn't that interesting? I think we have closure on this matter, master Kenobi. I disagree, Chancellor. Everything we've learned from this is that the Sith are persistent. They will not die. I understand your reservations, Master Kenobi, but I am afraid we can no longer allow this personal matter of yours to be a Republic concern. It does not appear this Darth Maul is a direct threat to the Republic. We need to redirect your efforts to the cause at hand: Stopping Count Dooku and thus ending the Clone Wars. Maul was trying to build an army of pirates. So let him. Let him play with the rabble. They're just petty crooks. It is of no relevance to the senate compared to the separatist threat. Good day, gentlemen. Something is stirring in the underworld. The crime families have had too much free rein since the Jedi have been distracted by the clone war. I fear it is a fertile place for Maul to flourish, if he has indeed survived. Hmm, right you may be, Obi-Wan, but heed the words of the Chancellor we must. A personal matter this is for you. Clouded your judgment may be. In time, if he lives, reveal himself again Maul will. And then swiftly we shall act.   \n                "}, "Rising Malevolence": {"episode": "s01e02", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tBelief is not a matter of choice, but of conviction. The clone starfleet is under seige. Dozens of Republic warships have been destroyed in merciless surprise attacks that leave no survivors. Rumors spread of a terrible new Separatist weapon. In the face of growing fear, The Jedi Council sends Master Plo Koon to hunt down the menace before it strikes again. The enemy ship has reduced its speed General. They must have realized we're tracking them. We're tracking 3 Republic cruisers. What should we do? Jam their transmissions. The fleet is holding its position sire. I think it wise to report our position before we attack. Skywalkers' fleet is nearby, in the Bith system. Good. Perhaps he can reinforce us. From what I hear, Skywalker's always ready for a fight. So I've heard. Koh-to-ya, Master Plo. Koh-to-ya, little Soka. How's the hunt for the mystery weapon going? We've tracked it to the Abregado system. We need reinforcements. I'll have to ask the Council Master Plo. I was given strict orders to protect our staging area. Master Plo, what's happening What is wrong with the transmission? There's too much interference sir. We've lost 'em. You heard Master Plo, He needs our support. We have to go help him. We have to see what the Council decides first. This is an important meeting, Ahsoka. Remember, be mindful, and speak only when spoken to. This mystery weapon has struck in a dozen systems, and disappeared without a trace. We cannot afford to lose anymore ships my friends. Master Skywalker. Have you had any success in finding General Grievous' secret weapon? Master Plo was here in the Abregado system when we lost contact. - The enemy ship is closing. - Prepare for battle. General Grievous, this will be a suitable test for our new weapon. You may fire when ready. Yes my lord. We're picking up a large energy reading from the target sir. - Open fire. - We're not in range yet sir. Fire! Brace for impact! We're losing all our power. That energy field has left us defenceless. - Their shields are down. - All cannons, fire. Their tearing us apart one by one. Quickly, into the pods. We don't have much time, get inside, hurry! Another successful test, wouldn't you say Count? We must keep our position secret. Send out the hunters. I want all of those lifepods destroyed. We've had no further contact with General Plo Koon. The absence of distress beacons indicates that his fleet was that his fleet was destroyed, like the others. We are about to prepare a rescue mission. Hasn't clone intelligence reported this weapon never leaves any survivors? The Separatists are being unusually tidy. They don't want any witnesses. Tragic are these losses, but prevent more, we must. The power grid is burned out. We've no engines, communications or life support recharge. So, we'll just sit here, and hold our breath. Someone will come looking for us, right? Let's get the power restored, so we are here to be found. All our battle groups will be reassigned to guard our supply convoys. Including yours Skywalker. I'm afraid we can't risk any more ships with a rescue mission. Wait! Just because there haven't been any survivors before, doesn't mean there won't be any this time. Boldly spoken for one so young. She is learning from Anakin. Excuse my padawan. We will deploy, as you've instructed, Master. Ahsoka! If anyone could survive, Master Plo could. - I don't understand why - What you don't understand, is Jedi protocol, or your place, my young padawan. Admiral. We'll split up our ships to maximize our defense area. I'll scout ahead for enemy activity. Isn't that risky, with the mystery weapon out there? It might be, but I know you won't argue my orders. Come on Snips. The air in here's getting a bit stale. Don't look at me, it's Boost sir. He only takes a bath when he's on leave. Save it. Just keep working on the pod, not your jokes. Do you think we've got a chance General? I don't believe in chance Commander. I know if we work together we will stay alive, and someone will find us. With all due respect General, strategically it doesn't make any sense for someone to come look for us. If I was in command, I'd be huntin' that weapon down. I value your life, - more than finding that weapon. - Sir. There's another pod out there. If we only had power we could contact them. How 'bout we just wave hello when the viewport comes around.. They're dead. Someone busted that pod wide open. We are not alone out here. Set those new coordinates R2? Master, I should tell you why I spoke up before You don't have to explain anything. R2, set up the scanner, modulate for incoming, \"mystery\" weapons. No, R2, tune the scanners for life forms. highest sensitivity. Why would we scan for life forms to spot an enemy weapon probably just filled with, battledroids? The Abregado system. So it's okay when you don't follow what the council says! Doing what the Jedi Council says, that's one thing, how we go about doing it, that's another. That's what I'm trying to teach you my young padawan. So you always meant to come out here for survivors? Lives are in danger Asohka, we can't just turn our backs on them. That's what I said back in the briefing room! I know, but the way you said it was wrong. Hurry up, switch on the illuminator. We haven't got much time before the fleet misses us. No, that's not it. This one goes there, that one goes there. Are you sure? We don't want to make things worse. How, are we gonna make things worse? When you ask for trouble, you should not be surprised when it finds you. I think trouble already found us sir. What if we connect these two wires, right here? I'm getting something. pod 197we're under attack. Is anyone out there? It's one of our other pods. I repeat, we are under attack. Is anyone out there? That signal is weak, they must be close by. They've locked onto our ship! Go get 'em boys! Our position is mark 12, at point 26. - Let's cut this can open. - I have visual contact. Pod 1977, do you copy? The droids are hunting for survivors. They're cutting through! There they go. Things, just got a lot worse. The scanners are practically useless. Got anything on the emergency channel R2? Now Ahsoka, we might find something you don't want to find. I know Master, but I have to believe. How do you know Master Plo anyway? He's one of my oldest friends. It was Master Plo Koon who found me, and brought me to the temple where I belonged. Now he's lost, so I thought, maybe I could find him. Incoming transmission Master. Anakin, where are you? Hello Master. Uh, we made a quick stop in the Abregado system. - You have other orders. - It was my idea Master Obi-Wan. Oh I'm sure. - Well, have you found any survivors? - No, you were right. The Separatists don't want any witnesses. All the more reason for you to rejoin the defensive escorts. We need you, Anakin. You're going to miss the rendezvous with the fleet if you don't hurry. I know Master. We're on our way. I'm sorry Ahsoka. What is it R2? R2 thinks he's got something on the emergency channel. Can he trace it? Let's get going. I think they see us. Corporal, there's another pod over there. It is time to go. Go? Where are you going sir? Outside to destroy the enemy. I can withstand the pressure for a brief time. Put your helmets on. If you say so sir. Wolf, keep the communications signal alive. It is our only chance someone will find us. Let's just hope someone's looking for us. Are we still picking up that signal? Yes, but why aren't we finding anybody? I don't know Ahsoka, I don't know. Well, this looks like the last one. Let's finish the job. Is there anyone out there? This is Ahsoka Tano. Can anyone here me? Time to put the squeeze on them. Is there anyone out there? Come in. - This is Ahsoka Tano. - It's Ahsoka. - She must be close. - Keep the signal alive, commander. R2, see if you can boost the reception. Patience. We're trying to boost the power. Hang on. We're losing the signal. The pod can't take much more damage. - Sinker, your turn. - I'm on it boss. What the Eat lazer clankers. Sir, we've lost contact with the pod hunter. Perhaps some survivors are putting up a fight. That is something we cannot allow. We must find a way to destroy this mystery weapon. In this war, a step ahead of us, Dooku always seems. Tell me, has there been any word from Master Plo Koon or his fleet? No, we must fear the worst. Actually, I just received word that Anakin has found the remains of Master Plo's fleet and is searching the debris for survivors. On whose authority has he done this? His own, I'm afraid. With his fleet out of position, we are left vulnerable. Oh his fleet is right where it should be, He's taken only a small ship, and his padawan. Twice the trouble, they have become. A wreckless decision, Skywalker has made. Let us hope it is not a costly one. Well, General, another fine mess we've gotten into. Your sense of humor is improving. I don't mean to say I told you so, but I never believed anyone would come looking for us. Anakin, the Council is furious. Why, have you left your post? I decided we couldn't just give up on Master Plo Koon. A noble gesture, Anakin. But the Council feels your daring may put others in danger. Please, listen to me Anakin. Return at once. Yes, Exellency. Time to go Ahsoka. We have to stay. Ahsoka, I want to believe Master Plo is alive but I know he's alive! I can sense it. Seargent, why are you so certain no one is coming? We're just clones sir. We're meant to be expendible. Not to me. - There they are! - Ready tow cable Cable loaded Master. Come on, hurry! Are you okay Master Plo? There's someone in the pod. Will they be alright? The pressure suits offer some protection, but they require a medical frigate for recovery. I will stabilize them sir. Your men are safe now. Tell me, were there any survivors? We couldn't find anybody else. The hunters must have destroyed the rest. I'm sorry, Master Plo. We tracked the mystery weapon to this system, that is when we found out it was an ion cannon. An ion cannon? A weapon that neutralizes all power to our ships, leaving the targets defenseless. There's a massive vessel approaching. Shut down the power systems before they detect us. The droid! Sorry little guy. That is one big, cruiser crusher. There's still no signal from the pod hunter. Reduce speed and activate your scanners. We will find who is responsible. - Hey, what's with the lights? - Power is gone out. Maybe that ship has returned. We should get up to the bridge. You're too weak. Let me go see what is wrong. We're picking up a faint signal from a droid, it's not one of ours. They're right behind us. Move us into attack position. They're coming back. Are all the systems shut down? Is there a problem sir? We forgot to shut off the medical droid. We've got to get the power back on now. - May I be of assistance? - No thanks. Just get in the back and take care of the clones. That is my programming, sir. - Come on, we've gotta get out of here. - I know! I know! Sir, the enemy is attempting to flee through the debris field. General, I don't want any witnesses. Energize plasma rotors. R2, program the navicomputer. Be ready to get us out of here. You forgot, we turned him off! 'Cotooya' droid. Target range almost locked sir. They're not going to make it. R2, program the hyperdrive. Anywhere, hurry! Enemy ship targeted General. Fire! Master? We're clear. Now the Republic will learn of our ion cannon. Your failure is most unfortunate. I will have to discuss this, with my Master. - Get back to work! - Roger roger. Thanks for getting us out of there in one piece General Skywalker. You have my padawan to thank for that. She always said you guys would pull through. General Plo said someone would come for us, we're glad he was right. Skywalker, it is time to give our report to the Council. Right, the Council report Come on, Ahsoka. You want me there? - I figured because of before - Asohka, through it all you never gave up, You did a great job. But, if I'm getting in trouble for this, you're gonna share some of the blame too. so come on, let's go. Right beside you, Master.   \n                "}, "The Zillo Beast": {"episode": "s02e18", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tDesperate times call for desperate measures! In one of the longest and fiercest battles of the war, separatist forces are on the verge of claiming the planet Malastare. If the Republic loses this planet, it will cost them vital fuel resources necessary for maintaining their armies. In a final effort to turn the tide of this battle, supreme chancellor palpatine has authorized the use of the Republic's newest weapon: The electro-proton bomb. Now at the imperial palace of doge urus, the ader of the dugs, the jedi count down the minutes until the detonation of their doomsday device. That's a lot of clankers. I won't allow my people to become separatist slaves. I assure you, doge urus, that will not happen. Dr. boll has stated that only droids will be affected by the bomb's electron field. Yes, the clones and your people will be quite safe. We have accounted for every probable outcome. That concerns me, doctor. There must be other options. I'm afraid not. This bomb is our only hope for victory now. The droids are on the move. Go! Go! Back until the bomb drops. Blast them! Hold the line! We've got fighters inbound. Tell the bombers to take off. Approaching drop zone. Everyone stay tight. Remember, you've only got one shot at this. Bombs away. Uh-oh. Here it comes. I'm losing my transmission. Well, doc, looks like it worked. The ground is sinking. Run for it! The droid army was completely neutralized by the bomb. But the blast created a sinkhole which engulfed many of our troopers. We have search parties looking for them now. And the dugs? Have they signed the treaty? No, chancellor, the treaty must be passed by the council. We need that treaty signed so we can gain access to the fuel reserves here on Malastare. Without it, our armies shall be vulnerable. I will do my best. Sir, we have a report from the front. They've lost contact with the rescue team. One problem always seems to replace another. I hope your bomb has not upset the delicate balance of our planet. You deal with the treaty and doge urus. I'll help the rescue team in the crater. Split up. If you see anything, contact me. General windu, we found them! We've got what we've We're on a very tight timeline here. How long do you think it'll take to get the treaty ratified? We are waiting for two more members of the council to arrive. They will sign the treaty. We appreciate your cooperation. Without your fuel, our offensive will grind to a halt. This is the beginning of a great alliance. What happened down here, trooper? General, there's something down here with us, and it's not seppies. Calm yourself, soldier. We'll check it out. Trapper, ponds, hawkeye, come with me. Skywalker, something strange is going on. I think you should come I'm on my way. Artoo, start up my fighter. If you'll excuse me Sir, there's nothing around here but rocks and debris. I have a bad feeling about this. Skywalker! I'm here. What the We need your help! Artoo, I can't see. Turn on your beacon. Never mind. What the heck is that thing? Now's our chance. Let's go. I have never seen anything like it! Artoo, get out of here. What? Uh-oh. We're going to need some heavy artillery. Don't worry about me. I'm all right. Where's your starfighter? That thing ate it. That thing, it is a zillo beast. They once roamed Malastare, devouring our ancestors. When the dugs first started harvesting the fuel in the planet's core, they were killed off. They are supposed to be extinct. Apparently, they're not. His weakness What's going on out there? It is an internal matter. None of your concern. Your men are killing a unique life-form. It is a dangerous, bloodthirsty monster! Did you forget that it tried to kill you? It was under attack. It had lived peacefully below the surface for all these years. Until you unleashed it with your bomb! We dropped that bomb to save your planet, at your request! To save our fuel for you to buy. If you want us tsign your treaty, then you must help us destroy the beast. What purpose would it serve to kill it? If it really is the last of its kind-- it is our duty! Our ancestors warned us that one would return someday and destroy our entire civilization. Will you help us or not? I respect your traditions and your ancestors, but we cannot allow the destruction of an innocent life-form. Then there will be no treaty. Master windu, are you certain this argument is worth it? I mean, after all, it's just one creature. Remember what the chancellor said. It isn't the creature. It's the principle. Allowing the dugs to kill it violates what we stand for but if we choose to defend the creature, we lose all hope of securing a treaty with the dugs. We'll handle this our way, no matter what these jedi think. How remarkable. I have never seen anything quite like it. I recommend that we transport it off the planet as soon as possible. We can find a place for it to live undisturbed in the outer rim. And what do the dugs have to say on this matter? They want us to help them destroy it. Then by all means, help them. This creature is of no importance to us. We cannot be alienating the dugs at this crucial time. It is not the jedi way to take an innocent life, especially if it is the last of its kind. Chancellor palpatine, I think it would be in our best interest to study this creature. Its outer scales are virtually none of our weapons could harm it. Even my lightsaber couldn't cut it. If we could somehow duplicate that for our ships-- an impenetrable armor. What if we let the dugs think we killed it? Then we could have the treaty and the creature. Yes, Anakin, go on. When I was climbing on the creature, I noticed small gaps between the armor and its scales. Maybe a stun cannon or--or a pulse could penetrate through the skin and short-circuit its nervous system, like putting it into a deep sleep. He's right. It would appear to be dead. We could transport it to a secure location before it wakes up. The dugs would never know the difference. That may be the only way we shall get this treaty signed and rest master windu's conscience. I'm glad you finally decided to see things our way, jedi. But you're a fool if you think your weapons will even scratch zillo beast. These are no ordinary weapons. Your zillo beast will be no match for them. Maybe true. But our way is already proven. Your way? Open the valve! Our fuel is deadly to the beast. It killed them in the past. It will kill this one now. You're only going to provoke it. You'll drive it out of that hole, and then it'll be harder to deal with. We'll handle it, jedi. Order them to stop! What? What do you mean, stop? I said, order them to stop! Or what? We are iocent life-forms too, are we not? Charge up the Rays! Fire. Back up! Back up! This isn't working! Whose bright idea was this, anyway? Keep the beam on him. He's getting tired. Hey, it worked! Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. You go first. Now we just have to get him out of here. Welcome to the Republic, doge urus. I am sure this business arrangement will be mutually beneficial. The beast has been loaded onto the transport. Have you selected a planet for relocation? There has been a slight change of plans. The scientific community has reviewed t data on this rather unique creature. They believe it should be further studied in a more controlled environment before it is released into the wild. And where is this controlled environment? On coruscant. Master windu, you and general Skywalker shall safely bring the beast here. Well, you made the right choice. We get our fuel, you save your creature, and now he'll be safe. Let's hope we can say the same about coruscant.   \n                "}, "The Gungan General": {"episode": "s01e12", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tDooku held for ransom. After escaping capture by Jedi knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the villainous count Dooku fell into the clutches of pirates led by the brigand Hondo Ohnaka. Eager to get custody of Dooku, the Republic agreed to pay Hondo a hefty sum in exchange for the Sith Lord. But Anakin and Obi-Wan had not counted on the treacherous cunning of Ohnaka and his band. Master. What happened? Well, I guess that pirate brew is stronger than we thought. I only took a sip. We were drugged, obviously. Why would they risk losing the ransom? The deal appears to have changed. They must be trying to triple their payday. A shrewd observation, Master Kenobi. Great. It's you. I did warn you these pirates were devious. You will notice our shackles are bound together. I have tried to separate us to no avail. It's bad enough we have to be in the same cell, but could you at least spare me the sound of your constant chatter? And while I hold my tongue, the two of you will devise a brilliant strategy for getting off this godforsaken planet? Yes! Excellent. I told you kidnapping the Sith Lord was a stroke of brilliance. I can almost smell that spice now. It'll be worth twice as much to us on the black market. But I think we could've gotten a bigger ransom from the separatists. You fool. Sometimes I wonder why I bother to keep you around. If we tried to ransom count Dooku off to the separatists, they would simply send their droid armies here to wipe us out. Now, as my sweet mother always said, \"Son, if one hostage is good,\" \"two are better.\" And three? Well, that's just good business. How much do you think they'll fetch? Don't you worry about how much. You'll get your cut. Just see to it that the Republic's ransom gets here. Once we get the ransom for the Sith, then we'll get the ransom for the Jedi. Thank you, mom. The spice is on its way. Hondo has asked me to go out and meet the Republic senators and bring them here with the ransom. But I want you to intercept that ship and force it down. Be careful. I want that spice intact. It's too risky. What about Hondo? Yeah, that nitwit couldn't kill a nuna. He depends on me for that. I'll tell him the ship was destroyed with everyone on it, including the spice. By the time he finds out the truth, we'll be long gone. - And we'll be landing - Hidey ho, chancellor. - Me-sa have a question. - In a moment, representative Binks. Good work, Senator Kharrus. I am relieved you're about to arrive at the pirates' stronghold safely. Captain Hondo, the leader of those brigands, will accept the ransom and turn count Dooku over to the Jedi. And then they will bring him back with you. Once we've landed, our signal will be strong enough to set up proper communications. Thank you, Senator. Senator Kharrus, representative Binks, take your seats. We are coming in for a landing. The last time I went on one of these ransom missions, I spent three weeks in a dungeon. Representative Binks, stop fooling around. We're landing. Secure yourself. Me-sa trying. Is-sa stucken. - We're under attack. - We've been betrayed. - Missile closing! - Bank left! What the - Jar Jar, what are you doing? - Sorry. Me-sa fix it. - Mack, what's going on back there? - Sir, you must get out of the cockpit. - We're hit! - Sir, you must leave. Get back into your seat. We're going down. Don't you think our priority should be escape first, eat second? Do control your prot\u00e9g\u00e9's insolence so I can concentrate. - Anakin. - What? Control your insolence. The count is concentrating. Well done, if I do say so myself. Most impressive. Me-sa no see a senator Kharrus. Pilots are dead. Sir, over here. I found the senator. He can't be dead. We've got to figure out a way to contact Coruscant. They crashed into Doshar field. Good, good. And you have the spice? No, not exactly. No. I think there are survivors. We have to call it off. Maybe we should tell Hondo. No one tells Hondo anything! If anyone survived that crash, we'll take care of 'em. Trust me, we're getting that spice. We do know where we're going, don't we? Hush, Anakin. Do we know where we're going? Quiet. I was brought this way when I was captured, it was open then. I found the door key. This is the way to the hangar. Yes, but are you sure it's safe? - The key works. - Is it safe? Of course it is. Right Hold it right there, Jedi. What were we thinking, following a Sith Lord? What to do? What to do? What to do? I don't want to kill you, per se. In fact, you seem like decent fellows Even you, Count. This is just business, and once I get my money, we can go back to being friends. It's very simple. Now, try not to complicate things by breaking out again. We have to get out of here before the Republic arrives with the ransom. For once, I agree with you. - Any luck repairing the homing beacon? - No, sir. You-sa find rest, Senator. Thosen with good in their heart always passen too soon. Sir, with the death of senator Kharrus, are you now in command of the mission? Technically, no. Then, who is? Representative Binks is the highest-ranking person here. - We be missing you, Senator. - Sir, this place is dangerous. Look, those geysers are spitting out acid. These-a beasties don't like the geysers neither. What is it, Sergeant? How are we gonna deliver the ransom to the Jedi and get count Dooku back? You do not want to stand guard. I do not want to stand guard. You want to deactivate the cell bars and go out drinking. I want to deactivate the cell bars and go out drinking. Not bad. Yes, most impressive, Master Kenobi. What's-a that? You think this is trouble? They could be the ones we're supposed to deliver the ransom to. Or they-sa the ones that be shooting us down. You're right, Binks. Incoming! Form a circle! There's not enough cover out here. They're cutting us off from the shuttle. We've got to regroup. Follow me. Let's hide. Come on, men. Where'd they go? I don't know. Maybe they fell in a crater. Find the spice. Should we look for the clones in the crater? Get back here. Once that geyser goes off, they're broiled. - We're not gonna last long in here. - Don't worry. As long as those beasties are up there, we're safe. When they run, we run. See? Me-sa knew it was safe, since the beasties are nearby. Come on, let's go! Commander, you're right. The ransom's gone. I suggest we stay here and wait for the Republic - to send the rescue party. - We-sa can't wait. We don't have much choice. Ani and Obi are waiting for us to deliver the spicen. Those pirates are on speeders. How are we gonna catch them? Me-sa be having an idea. Hurry it up, Dooku. You should be more patient, Master. After all, the count is an elderly gentleman - and doesn't move like he used to. - I suppose you're right. I would kill you both right now if I did not have to drag your bodies. Look! There they are. Giddy up! Let him go, sir. We've got the spice back. Now we just have to get beyond that wall. Let's go! This is not going well. Don't let them get away! Hey, what are you guys doing? You're too heavy. I can't do it. Drop Dooku! I guess this means we won't be friend? Right, now that we have the spice, we need to find the compound. - Anything to the south? - Nothing, sir. Who knows where that pirate stronghold is from here. Well, look at that. Power lines. They must lead somewhere. There's-a power, dere's-a be people too. Captain! Well, Turk, did the Republic arrive with my spice? The Republic deceived us. They didn't send the ransom, they sent an army. They ambushed us in Doshar field. I suggest we counterattack with tanks. - Where are your men? - I was the only survivor. I think they will attack us to try and free the Jedi. I warned them. I didn't want to torture anyone. But now, even in a galaxy at war, you hope to find some honor. Let me take our tanks. I'll make 'em pay. Go. Stop them before they reach the compound. I will deal with the Jedi. Yes, Captain. We have to find a way out of here before Senator Kharrus and Jar Jar arrive. We'll look like fools. I think it's time to lose the dead weight. You two, come with us. There be some bombat clankens coming this-a way. What? Bombat clankens? Right there! - Where? - There! - Wait! - Over there! Come on! There! You're right. Bombat clankers. Representative Binks, we're going to need your services - for this part of the mission. - Who-sa? Me-sa? Yes, sir. You are the senate representative. We need you to go out there and negotiate with the pirates. Me-sa no liken this idea, but I think is-sa what senator Kharrus woulda do-sa. He's probably going to get himself killed. Don't worry. He's smarter than he looks. I take it the Republic didn't arrive with the ransom. Your Republic obviously doesn't want the Sith Lord. They didn't show? They did. They did show With a huge army that they thought would be enough to get the better of me, - Hondo! - That can't be right. Are you calling me a liar? Isn't that kind of what you do for a living? You reject my hospitality, refuse to wait in your cell, and now, you're going to insult me? - I'm just saying. - Anakin. What? He is a pirate. Yes, but this may not be the best time for you to speak - But you - At all, Anakin. What are you supposed to be? Me-sa representative Binks. Me-sa coming to deliver the spicen. Where's the army Turk reported? Don't know. Let's fry this one and look around. No, if he's a representative, he might be worth something as well. You, representative Bink, we'll take you to your Jedi friends so you can negotiate. Okey day. Sir, they're taking - representative Binks hostage. - Get ready. Sorry. Sorry! What happened to the power? I was having fun. What the Hold it right there. Kill him. Kill him. He's no representative. He's a plague! Who's-a plague-a? Me-sa? I wouldn't do that if I were you. Nice work, sir! We're leaving without the spice? It won't be long until Hondo figures out what's happened. What are you doing? What chance do you really have, Jedi? Now let me go, and I might let you live. Approach us, and he dies. Looks like your forces were destroyed, Jedi. Ani! Obi! Me-sa have arrived with the spicen. Excellent, Jar Jar, assuming he pirates still have count Dooku to trade. Well, that answers that question. Commander, start the engines, please. So what now, Jedi? You're going to arrest me? - No. Anakin, release him. - What? Captain, you have nothing we want, and since we're not prisoners anymore, you have no bargaining power. What? You-sa was in bombad trouble? Me-sa rescued you. No, Jar Jar. We weren't in any trouble. Let's leave on even terms. Hold. Hold! Jedi, after everything, you're just going to walk away? We have no quarrel with you, and we seek no revenge. Indeed. Very honorable, Master Jedi. Captain, you will find that count Dooku doesn't share our sense of honor, and he knows where you live. I'm so worried about my Master. - Hurry! - We made it! Too late! He got hurt saving our skins from the Separatists. And now, we're stuck on some uncharted planet. - Did you hear that? - I've got to convince these villagers to help him before it's too late. I have a bad feeling about this.   \n                "}, "An Old Friend": {"episode": "s06e05", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tAs the war between the Republic and the Separatists intensifies, many are driven from their home planets, and it is up to Senator Amidala to secure aid for them. All eyes turn to the Banking Clan and the planet Scipio. In an effort to remain independent from the Republic and the Separatists, all operations are divided, and money transactions are performed in a neutral zone surrounding the main vault. For operations to continue, there must be no war on Scipio. However, worry about the stability of the Banking Clan is brewing within the Republic as the wellspring of money may be in jeopardy. Welcome to Scipio, Senator. If you will follow me, we will be traveling into the neutral zone. Va-tee, p'tee see-li Senatee Amidala. I am afraid your guards will have to wait outside. Of course. As Council of Five, we are honored but surprised that you have traveled all this way for a mere bank transfer. A transfer that has not been forthcoming. By request of the Supreme Chancellor, I am here to expedite matters. Of course. We would merely request that you meet with our special representative, who will go over the terms and conditions of your loan. Senator Amidala. Clovis! You two know one another? Sir, I was assured that this transaction would be free of prejudice and partisan allegiance. This man is a known Separatist and traitor to the Republic. Padm\u00e9. I can assure you Rush Clovis is our most trusted and best negotiator. I am sorry, gentlemen, but I insist this man be removed from these negotiations. Until then, we have nothing further to discuss. My lady no longer requires your assistance this evening. Thank you. My lady! Watch out! I would stop right there if I were you. How did you get a blaster into the neutral zone? We're resourceful. Now, why are you breaking in to my quarters? Padm\u00e9, you don't understand what is going on here. I need your help. Last time you needed my help, I ended up poisoned, and you did nothing. That's not true. You stole data files from me. That revealed the location of a Separatist droid factory sponsored by you! Look, it's not safe. We can't talk here. Senator, I really don't think It's all right. I want to hear what he has to say. The simple fact is the economics of this war are not adding up. You're here for a bank transfer. But I can assure you, there is no money in the bank. That's absurd. They were ready to give me the funds today. Oh, they will give you your first installment, yes, but they're robbing one side to save the other. The entire Banking Clan is on the verge of collapse. Collapse? Where's the evidence? In the vault. The accounts are sealed there, and no one is allowed to see them besides the Core Five. Convenient. Well, now that you're here, you must put pressure on them. And do what, exactly? Help me gain access to the vault. You're insane to think I would ever trust you. I'm sorry, but I cannot help you. Take your hands off me! I've risked everything to tell you this. Don't you see they're trying to kill me because of what I know? Please believe me. Our past must count for something. I can't stay here. Think about what I ask. If what you are saying is true, then this information Clovis is offering is vital to our security. I need you to be very clear in this matter. For the Republic Is he telling the truth? Yes, I am sure. Perhaps, then, in this scenario, it would be best for you to trust an old friend and do what he suggests. I've decided to accept Clovis as the representative of this transaction, as long as I can go into the vault and accompany the funds throughout the entire process. No outsider is ever allowed into the vaults. I come with the authority of the Supreme Chancellor. If you have something to hide, then that is something we should discuss. Hide? I think considering last night's attack on the Senator, it is only fair that we are transparent and agree to these terms. What harm will come of it? The vault will be opened first thing in the morning. Please make sure you are here, Senator. Where, exactly are we, Clovis? This is my personal residence. A bit remote, but we'll have more privacy here. Once I detonate the charge here at the main power source, the vault will go into immediate shutdown. No one will get in or out. This will give you very little time before the emergency generator cycles and takes over. You'll then use this to locate the exact files and download them from the mainframe. The vault is one of the most secure in the galaxy, but it was designed to keep people out. Once you're inside and the power is down, there is little they can do. You make it sound so easy. If you don't mind, Senator, I will retire for the night. Of course, Teckla. The information we get tomorrow will go a long way to expose perhaps the real criminals behind this war. These are war profiteers. I've exposed that before. Nobody cares. Truth is not on the battlefield. It's late. Good night, Clovis. Clovis, where are you going? I have some business to attend to. This was your idea. I should very much like for you to await the Senator's return. If you will follow me. The credits for the Republic are in this section. Uh! What happened to the lights? I can't see a thing! Find out what is going on, and open the vault immediately. The power has been cut, and the security lock has engaged. It will take some time to switch over. Where is the Senator? We got separated in the darkness. I'm here. No thanks to your security system! This isn't a vault; it's a tomb. What is going on? My deepest apologies, Senator. It seems I'm witness to many firsts on Scipio. Is this an unfortunate incident or a cover-up? I'm I'm not sure what you mean. I'm afraid I'm going to have to report on your sad state of affairs to the Chancellor. Let's see if you got what we needed. As I said, the vaults are empty. The Chancellor must see this immediately. Senator Amidala, you are under arrest for espionage. No, there's been some kind of mistake. Take her away. I have powerful friends. The Chancellor will hear about this. This way, Master Jedi. Ha ha ha. Well, well, well. What exactly is going on here? Ani, I'm so glad to see you. Ah, I guess I'm not only useful for fighting wars after all. How long have I been in here? A few days. They say Teckla is dead. Is it true? Yes. She was found shot at the bomb site. By who? They don't know. The Muuns say she sabotaged the power grid. What exactly is going on here? You have to get me out of here. Clovis has Clovis? What exactly does Clovis have to do with this? Ugh, I can't explain it here. How could you ever put your trust in a man like Clovis after what he did? It's for the Republic, Anakin. Something is very wrong with the banks. Why is it that when Clovis is around, your excuse is always that you're \"doing it for the Republic\"? Anakin, please You know, maybe I'll just leave you here. Ani. You've already been released into my custody. You better come with me before I change my mind. Anakin, please trust me. I can't leave without the files Clovis and I took from the vault. Where exactly do you suggest we look? The discs may be outside the city at Clovis' private residence. Fine. I'll do this for you, not for Clovis. Artoo Have the ship ready in case I need you. Over there. Huh! Cozy place. Someone was looking for the files. They must know Clovis has them. Well, maybe they found what they were looking for, and that's why he's missing. Ha! We can only hope. Anakin, you're not helping things. You don't seem to understand how important these files are. They'll expose a corruption that goes to the very core of the Banking Clan. Clovis! Padm\u00e9! I knew you'd come. You again? Yes, me again. All right, lover boy, where's the disc? I'm not about to hand over the information to some pilot. I'm a Jedi Knight who can save your life i f you hand over the files. So what's it going to be? You going to give us the disc? What, so you can leave me stranded like last time? Well, that depends on how well-behaved you are. Can you both stop bickering, so we can get out of here? Get down! Thanks. It wasn't you I wanted to save. Anakin, get us out of here. Follow me. Run for it! Artoo, bring the ship around, and pick us up. Look out! Anakin! Did we lose him? Uh! I'm all right. Ahhh! Artoo. Hone in on my signal. Artoo? Hey! Nice catch! Ah, gudtak Marrok. Que passkuna Bestiole-li! It seems your mission was a success, Bounty Hunter. From this point, I will deal with them myself.   \n                "}, "Sabotage": {"episode": "s05e17", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tInvasion! The planet Cato Neimoidia is under Separatist attack. Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ashoka Tano, rush to the rescue as they lead a squadron of starfighters to the planet below. Ahsoka, punch a hole for the gunships to get through. I know the drill, Master. Look out, incoming missiles. No problem. Uh slight problem. Ahsoka, I've got buzz droids. How bad did you get hit? I'm all clear. What? You always have it easy, Snips. Good job, Artoo. Someday these droids will learn they keep messing with the wrong Jedi. Looks like you're clear. Just keep watching and learning, Padawan. Uh-oh. You're trailing smoke. What's wrong? Oh, nothing serious. Just a small malfunction. Ugh! Master? Master, come in. Artoo, what's going on over there? Unconscious? Fly back to the cruiser. What do you mean there's something wrong with the engines? Tip your wing. I'll see how bad it is. Oh, that's not good. Let's just say now would be a good time to land. Artoo, can you land the ship on that cliff ledge? I don't care if the landing zone is too short. Get that ship on the ground. R7, take over the ship. I'm going after Anakin. Somebody has to save his skin. Artoo! Ugh, very funny, Artoo. Are you okay, Master? Yeah, what'd I miss? Oh, not much. Wait a minute. Wasn't I flying? Where's my fighter? How did I get here? Fighter crashed. I saved the day. You're welcome. Huh, all right. Captain Rex, Ahsoka and I need a little help. Right away, sir. Master Yoda. Return to the Jedi Temple quickly, you should, you and your Padawan. We're kind of busy, Master Yoda. The reason we need you, important it is, Skywalker. Bombed the Temple hangar, someone has. Your assistance to find the terrorist, we need. Who could successfully bomb the Jedi Temple? We'll be right there, Master. How could the Separatists infiltrate the Temple? Worse than that it is. What could be worse, Master Yoda? Everything is on the table. We have to look at the possibility that it could've been anyone in the Temple, even a Jedi. If a Jedi this is, gone to the dark side they have. I I can't believe a Jedi would attack a place this sacred. We'd like for you two to lead the investigation. We can't trust anyone who was here, even a Jedi. You and Ahsoka will provide an impartial point of view free of assumptions. We'll do everything we can. Careful you must be, Skywalker. If willing to destroy the Temple the attacker is, to great lengths they will go to keep from being caught. Then I guess we'll have to go to even greater lengths to catch him. I can still hear the screams. Do you believe what they said, Master, that a Jedi could do this? Not every Jedi agrees with this war, Ahsoka. There are many political idealists among us. But a traitor? I'm afraid one can eventually become the other. Remember Count Dooku and General Krell. That's how they started too. Only analysis and investigation will prove what is true or not. Who are you? I am Russo-ISC, Crime Scene Analyzer for the Jedi. I will be working with you and your Padawan on this case. I was assigned by Master Windu. Okay, Russo, you and Ahsoka should begin the interviews. I would rather interview the witnesses alone. Why? Many of the wounded have heard rumors a Jedi was behind this explosion. There will be ill will toward you. I think you're overexaggerating, Russo. There were Jedi killed in that blast along with maintenance crew and clones. Take Ahsoka with you. Let me know if you find anything. I will, Master. Did you notice anything unusual about the hangar? Not really. Although, I left the hangar five minutes before the bomb exploded. Did everything seem okay before that? Everything seemed normal. Is it true a Jedi might be responsible for the attack? We're not certain of anything at this point. This distrust is troubling. Some of these people have worked in the Temple for years. Fear makes even the most trusting individual irrational. I think I know who did it, who blew up the hangar. Who? I believe it was Jackar Bowmani. Jackar Bowmani. Who is Jackar? One of the maintenance crew in the hangar. Why do you think it was him? I passed him as I was going on my shift change. He he had been working all morning in the section the blast came from. It was the last place I saw him. Is this him? Yes. I need to know, have you seen him since the explosion? No. Truthfully, I didn't see much of anything after the explosion. Thank you. Looks like we need to find Jackar Bowmani, Russo. Did you find anything? No, but the rumor about it being a Jedi is growing, Ahsoka. I can feel the anger and confusion throughout the Jedi Temple. Russo and I have a lead. We are looking for one of the Temple workers, Jackar Bowmani. One of the witnesses saw him in the area where the bomb exploded right before it happened, and we have not been able to find him anywhere. Come on. Nobody just disappears. Unless it was well planned out. Well, it had to be well planned out to get past Jedi. I'll talk to security. No more clones. Stop the violence. End the war. Stop the violence. They're all family and friends? Yes, looking for answers. So am I, Cin. This is the guy who might be behind all of this. If you see him, alert me immediately. That is Jackar. You know this man? He is my husband. I've been trying to reach him since I heard of an explosion. Where is he? I need you to come with me. You have no idea where Jackar is? No. You are a Jedi, and you cannot find him? I understand your frustration. Don't. Just find Jackar. Letta, do you think Jackar could do something like this, blow up the Temple? Do you have any idea what someone has to go through to work in the Jedi Temple, hm? Jackar dedicated his life to serving the Jedi. It had been his dream. Not just anyone can walk into your precious Temple. He passed all the entry tests that were needed. Okay, I had to ask. Unfortunately, everyone's a suspect. Jackar would never do anything like this. Please, find him. Hmm based on the trajectory of the debris, it seems the blast came from there. Why is there no bomb residue? So you think whoever did this triggered a ship to explode? We think so. Russo's trying to use the shrapnel to determine that now. The witness says he saw Jackar in the area. Maybe Jackar planned to do this and just kept quiet. Or It actually was a Jedi. I found something, an anomaly, something that should not be here. These pieces came from the blast origin. They are covered with microscopic droids of a highly volatile nature. Nano-droids. Yes, nano-droids. Great. Now we're chasing nano-droids. Russo, go through security footage. Try to see if Jackar went to other parts of the Temple. Ahsoka, let's go find out how Jackar got his hands on these nano-droids. Bowmani's file, Master Jedi. He's a munitions expert. Jackar was the foreman over all of the gunships, bombs, and weapons. His specialty was nano-weaponry. We've got to find this guy. Isn't that going a little too fast for you to make sense out of it? It is simple data. At this pace, I am able to view hundreds of hours of footage. Have you found Jackar? No. I'll gather some Jedi and search the Temple. If he's still here, he might be planning another attack. Instead of Jedi, I have droids that can do the job much faster. So you've found nothing so far? We have a clue we're following. But we still don't have answers. It is imperative that the truth be found soon. There are whispers the Senate will have a meeting to decide whether the military police will need to become involved in the investigation. They can't do that. Clones died in that explosion, maintenance clones working on the gunships as well as civilians. The Senate tends to take notice of these things no matter where they happen. Master Skywalker, we have found Jackar. Lock down all exits so he can't escape. Where is he? Well, part of him is here. I don't think now is a good time to joke. This is all that remains of Jackar. His hand? The rest of him exploded. Because he was so close to the bomb? Because he was the bomb. What's this? The connection we were looking for to the explosion in the hangar. The nano-droids. How did they get in his bloodstream? Oh, this just keeps getting better and better. We're going to have to search Jackar's home for evidence. This is not the nicest place. I would've thought working for the Jedi paid better. Letta? Are you here? You search for the droids, but be careful, and remember, he was a munitions expert. I'd rather not set off another explosion today. I'll see if he left a note. Letta? Master. The sensors are picking up traces from the disposal. The nano-droids were in the food. Well, I guess the question now is, did he eat them willingly, or did someone feed them to him? Wh-what are you doing here? We've learned Jackar was involved in the bombing. That can't be true. See if she has any nano-droids on her, Ahsoka. Nanodroids? She's clean. What do you mean, \"nano-droids\"? We believe someone set Jackar up and made him the bomb. I I don't understand. Letta, I want to bring you in for more questioning. Maybe you can help us make sense out of all of this. I'll answer any question I can. Letta, stop. Letta! Letta. Take the high road. Right, Master. Letta, stop! Let me go. Running means you know more than you're telling us. Jackar is dead, and now you're trying to blame his murder on me. Nobody ever said he was dead. But running proves you had something to do with the bomb. You don't know what you're talking about. People blamed Jedi because of you. People were killed because of you! You can't prove anything. Did you feed the nano-droids to Jackar? You will answer me. Now! I did feed the nano-droids to Jackar. You set up your own husband to die? You're dealing with things you don't understand. Oh, where you're going, you'll have plenty of time to explain everything. We're holding Letta in the cell below the temple to await further questioning. I am pleased to report there were no other nano-droids found in the sweep of the Temple. I am also pleased to report, based on the security footage, Jackar Bowmani acted alone, which means no Jedi was involved. Thanks, Russo. Good job. Did this woman say what her reasons were for attacking us? Not yet, but we're working on that. I think we can guess her motives easily enough. Public opinion is swaying against the Jedi. That is becoming clear. This war is becoming less and less popular every day it persists. Master, I'm relieved we solved this case, but-- - What if it had been a Jedi? Yes. I don't know how I would have felt if a Jedi was really behind this. There are going to be Jedi who disappoint us, Ahsoka. But as long as we know there are good Jedi who fight for what's right, it makes it all worthwhile.   \n                "}, "Defenders of Peace": {"episode": "s01e14", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tSous-titres: {\\when surrounded by war,  Republic forces in retreat. While rescuing General Aayla Secura from certain defeat, Anakin Skywalker has been seriously injured. After a narrow escape, our heroes crashlanded on the remote world of Maridun. Stranded, and with no way to contact the Republic, the Jedi receive medical aid from the peaceful Lurmen colonists. But even on this tiny planet, the war threatens to follow the Jedi. Commander Bly, we've got company. - Friendlies? - Negative, sir. A droid ship coming straight our way. Acknowledged. Get back here. - General? - Yes, commander? We've got a Separatist ship incoming. This is neutral space. It won't be neutral for long, not if the Separatists have their way. - Help me up. - Don't struggle. I'm sorry, but you're still too injured to move. What menace have you brought to our village now, Jedi? Father, you can't blame them. He's right. The Separatists don't even know we're here. And they can't know. We've got to hide. Your presence here endangers us. You must leave before your enemies find you. But you'll need our help. You can't fight them alone. We will not fight them at all. We would rather die than to kill others. You're going to surrender? - But how can you - Ahsoka, stop. If the Lurmen want to remain neutral, we won't force them into war. See to it that they leave. I must see what our new visitors want. Take it easy, sir. We'll assist you. I am General Lok Durd of the Separatist alliance. I am Tee Watt Kaa, leader of this colony. - What do - You are now under the protection of the Separatist alliance. I congratulate you on your good fortune. Thank you, but we enjoyed good fortune well before your arrival. We are a peaceful people, General. I do not condone your presence here. Then stand aside. I would like to inspect my new colony. Ransack this dung heap. Why are they tearing apart our homes? We've done nothing to them! Violence, that's what those droids are programmed for. Can't we do anything? No, and if we are discovered, all of the Lurmen will be slaughtered. We'll be okay if we make it to the tall grasses. There is no evidence of any weapons or Republic contraband, General. In the future, we may conduct more periodic searches like this one in order to maintain security. Because we are such an obvious threat to you. We'll offer no resistance. Your species is smarter than you appear. Father, are you okay? At least the Jedi escaped. Yes, but they nearly brought harm to our entire village. But now, thanks to you, we're safe to grovel before every petty tyrant who enters our system. You would mock our very way of life? I have just ensured we will have peace. Yes, but for the moment, and at what price? Are you not concerned about the Jedi at all? I have no quarrel with the Jedi, but we cannot help them without being drawn into their war. Tub, track the Jedi. Follow them and make sure they get off world. You know, I can't figure those villagers not wanting to fight. No pride I guess. I call it no courage. Sometimes it takes courage to stick to one's beliefs, young padawan, as any Jedi well knows. We need to find a ship, and I think the only one around here belongs to the Separatists. We know they have a landing ship. They might have a shuttle. Sir, you talking about stealing from one of the clankers? - Count me in. - We need to find them first. I think we just did. Blast it! Jam its signal! After it! I'm fine. Just go! - Which way did it go? - This way. Hurry! We can't catch it if it gets out in the open. - I wonder where it was headed. - Maybe we can see them from up there. I hope you're feeling better, Master, 'cause look what we found. I'm getting stronger all the time, snips. But I'm not sure I'm ready for that. That shuttle's our ticket off this rock. It's not gonna be easy, sir. There don't seem to be any flaws in their security line. Apparently, the Separatists have a new toy. - See if you can get a closer look. - Yes, sir. I'll go with you, Commander. Is the defoliator capsule ready? Today is a grand day for the Separatist cause. We test a new weapon of my own design which is capable of catastrophic destruction, a weapon which will destroy organic matter but leave machines unharmed. But first, we need two volunteers. The volunteers are you and you. - Me? - Me? Go to that ridge. Roger, roger. Stay down, boys. Count Dooku, I have located a world in which we can test my Excuse me, our new weapon. I hope it turns out to be worth the expense. You may proceed. Yes, my Lord. Ready? Roger, roger. Aim. Fire! Should we take cover? No, idiot. That is not even gonna hit us. That's some toy It took out every living thing. As you can see, the landscape has been destroyed, and the droids are undamaged. Impressive, but now, we need to know how effective this weapon will be against living creatures. Of course. I specifically chose this planet because it is inhabited. The colonists will make excellent test subjects. Proceed, then. I eagerly await the results. Prepare to move out! Where are they off to now? They must be going back to the Lurmen village. There's nothing else in that direction. Those villagers won't stand a chance. First we'll take out the droids' communication station. After we get a shuttle, we'll go back and help them. But Tee Watt Kaa said he doesn't need our help. There's a difference between pulling innocents into a war and leaving them to extinction. Tell Wag Too that the Separatists are returning. Hey, what was that? Get to the door. I'll handle the droids. Check the exterior. We cannot have any surprises for the General. check out? What the The Separatists are on the march. They're returning to our village. They did not attack us before. There's no reason to think they will this time. Father, they wouldn't be coming back here unless they intended to do us harm. This is war! But not our war. We've done nothing to provoke them, and we will not. That is their way. So we will just lay down and be slaughtered? Father, even if we don't fight the Separatists, we must defend ourselves! Mounting a defense is still engaging in battle. If we sacrifice our beliefs, we're no better than they are. Our philosophy has helped us to survive for generations, and we will not change our morals now or ever. - Shield generator, sir. - Let's take 'em with us. Everyone, please, please listen. The Separatists will be here in moments. What are you doing here? I told you not to return. I'm afraid the Separatists don't care whether you're in the war or not. We need to get you to safety before they arrive. We will not abandon our homes. But they've got a new weapon. It'll burn this place to a crisp. Is this what all of you really want? If it is our destiny to be destroyed in your war, so be it. Droids inbound. We've got eight minutes tops. Come on, guys. Let's get these shield generators in place! When Count Dooku sees how successful my weapon is against civilian targets, I will no doubt be promoted to a more Substantial position within the alliance. Right. Well, the villagers appear to have put some pods together - in a barrier around the village. - Pods? How quaint. Jedi? What are they doing out here? Halt! Pray stop what you're doing. Stop building that wall. - I did not ask you to defend us. - This battle is inevitable. You can stand by your beliefs, but let us stand by ours. Thank you for what you're trying to do. I'm sorry, but I cannot help. My father is very Strong willed and set in tradition. Many others agree with me, but we were raised under a very strict code. We must respect it, even if we don't agree. - They're holding position. - They're not going to charge us, not if they can hit us from long range first. But if we can withstand that weapon, we'll draw them in. Prepare to fire! Good-bye, Jedi. Fire! Incoming! Power the shields! Now they'll have to get their hands dirty and meet us face-to-face. Squad one, prepare to charge. Prepare to charge. Charge! That's a lot of clankers. We got to stop them before they get through that shield. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Sir, the first squad has been destroyed. Squad two and three, attack! - That wasn't so tough. - That was just the first wave. Snips, get back to the village! I'll take care of the new weapon. That's it. We have to retreat! Take cover. They've breached the shield! They're taking out the shield generators. We have to do something. Their shield is down. Launch another shell. Sir, there's a Jedi heading right for us. Then blast him, you idiot! No survivors. Wag Too, what are you doing? - We're going to help. - I forbid this. What more would you have them do before we are allowed to defend ourselves? - But - We have to do this. Help! I'll be defoliated! There goes my promotion. The weapon has been disabled. Copy that, General. - Thank you, Wag Too. - Thank you. Our village would certainly have been destroyed without your protection. Father, I was just offering the Jedi our thanks. Perhaps we do owe you thanks, but I still wonder, at what cost? Why am I always the lucky one? As if freezing our behinds off on this rock weren't bad enough. What was that? Anakin and I have a full scale war on our hands since chairman Cho refuses to be reasonnable. They are savages. Trespassers! We must broker a peace between the Pantaurens and the creatures who call this place home.

Trident group one, attack the starboard engines. Trident group two, knock out their port shield generators. I'll go directly for their bridge. The port side deflectors are gone. Lord tyranus. My master. There is a disturbance in the force. Your assassin, she has become very powerful. Yes, my lord. She is quite important to me. Too important. Master Silence. I can sense her powers growing stronger. I would hate to think you are training your own sith apprentice to destroy me. Never. My allegiance is to you and you alone. Then you must prove it. Eliminate her. She's my most trusted I said eliminate her! As you wish, my lord. Ventress. Split up. Looks like I'm her favorite. I'm kind of disappointed. Only the droids follow me. You want to race? Come on. Anakin, I'm going to need some help. Where are you? Clang! I'm hit! I'm heading toward the separatist flagship. I see you. I've got her. Master, I need your help quickly. I'm surrounded. You have already lost the battle, child. I've ordered your reinforcements to return. No. I will destroy the jedi. I'll show you. You have failed me for the last time. You are no longer my apprentice. And now you shall die. Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan! No, thank you. No thank you, artoo. That's quite enough. Ventress, you're not looking well. She never does. You have failed, ventress. Surrender. Never. Ah! Whoosh! Whoosh! Yes, my lord. Ventress is battling the jed on board the command ship. Turn your guns on our command ship and open fire. But, my lord, I calculate that will destroy ventress, the jedi, and all our forces. Precisely. Ah! Uh! Yah! Ah! We're in position. Open fire. Ah! That is correct. Calculate your flight path to terminate in the main hangar. It's over. Anakin, look out! We have to get out of here. Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Abandon ship! The command ship has been destroyed. Our scanning indicates there are no survivors. Your work there is finished. Recall the fleet. By your command. Master. What is it, lord tyranus? I have done as you've asked. Asajj ventress is dead. Once again, you've proven your loyalty to me. You took quite a beating there. Didn't you, missy? Which side of the battle was you on? Aw. Not too talkative, are you? Take me to dathomir. Now, why would anyone want to go there? Ain't nothing there but fog and witches. Exactly. Whoosh! We don't like strangers. I'm not a stranger. Prepare to die. Stop. She is one of us. Take her to the village. Who is she? What is she doing here? Shh. Quiet. Mother Talzin. Bring the water of life. At last, you have returned, and you are safe again. I remember the day we were forced to give you up to protect the clan. Your sacrifice has never been forgotten. Master. Master, where are you? Master. They've killed you. Whoosh! Ah! You are strong with the force, little one. Thank you, master. Thank you, master. Master! Ah! Revenge. I must have revenge. I can sense the darkness within you. I will teach you the ways of the dark side. But you must prove yourself first. Master, I need your help quickly. I've ordered your reinforcements to return. No, I will destroy the jedi. I'll show you. You have failed me for the last time. And now you shall die. Dooku. He betrayed me. I know. I had hoped you would find your way to us sooner. I will have revenge. Yes, you shall, sister. We will see to it. Karis and naa'leth are the greatest warriors of our coven. I'll be the judge of that. They will help you destroy count dooku.

Perhaps even count dooku. What if he can sense us? Take this poison dart. It will dull his senses and distort his vision. Then you can deal with him easily. Jedi weapons. You'll need these. If the count engages you, he must believe that you are jedi. Naa'leth and karis, serve your sister well. Deliver your vengeance, sister. Then return to us. We shall prevail. This way. He's below us. You can sense him? I can smell his stench a parsec away. Be on guard at all times. He is no fool. He is a sith lord. Zip! Ah. What sorcery is this? I do not need my eyes to see you, jedi. Ah! Ah! Ah! He is stronger than I imagined. I warned you. Mother, we've We've failed. Where one sees failure, others see opportunity. What do you mean, mother? Your infiltration proves dooku is vulnerable. He will be eager to protect himself. How? By finding a replacement for you. Count dooku. It has been too long. Yes, mother talzin. How may I assist you? It has come to my attention that you have lost your most prized assassin. How would you know of this? I know these things. I have seen it. After all, she was once one of us.

The Jedi Temple is in disarray after a vicious terrorist attack. Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano set out to find the truth of who was really behind this horrendous catastrophe. Their investigation led them to discover the true saboteur, Letta Turmond. Now the Jedi attempt to return the Temple to normalcy. But first Master Yoda must give a eulogy to the fallen Jedi warriors. One with the Force, they are. And our job it is to remember that we will, in time, also pass on. Luminous beings are we, but temporary vessels, our bodies are. And we shall all find ourselves here in time. A moment of silence, I ask, to remember and to move on. You were close to one of them? Tutso Mara. We trained together. He taught me how to hold my lightsaber correctly. Live for the living Jedi, we must. Live through us, forever they will. So what happens to Letta now? The bomber has been moved. Moved? Where? Why should she be moved? The Republic military has taken her into custody. But why? This is a Jedi matter, isn't it? Clones were killed, which makes this terrorist attack a military matter. An attack on the Jedi is an attack on the Senate. Admiral Tarkin is right. Letta isn't a Jedi. It's not for us to be judge and jury over a citizen of the Republic. If Letta's guilty, she's guilty, and she should be dealt with. Calm down, Ahsoka. Remember, revenge is not the Jedi way. The evidence seems clear, Ahsoka. Nothing will ever change. The Chancellor feels very strongly that the Jedi be removed from as many military matters as possible. You yourselves said that you're peacekeepers, not soldiers. I hope Chancellor Palpatine knows what he's doing. I assure you that he rarely does anything without a strategy. I have many things to attend to, Masters. Good day. Ahsoka. Go. Be with your friend, Ahsoka. In ways, she is still very young. Indeed. Company? Sure. Every time I think about this, I feel conflicted. It's hard not to let feelings turn into attachment and pain. Ahsoka, have you ever wondered if it was right to ignore your emotions? My Master would say, \"Our struggle as Jedi is to move past them.\" You make it sound so easy. No, it isn't easy. But it's possible. Like, when we were stuck inside the battle tank on Geonosis, it was hard not to be afraid. Still, you and I got past it. And I guess we'll get past this. You've always been capable of seeing things clearly. I guess I've fooled you like I have everyone else. Yes, Master. Ahsoka, we're needed in the war room. It appears the Separatists have mounted another attack. Coming, Master. Look, I have to believe that one way or another, this woman's going to pay for what she did. You shouldn't keep your Master waiting. We've uncovered a Separatist plan of attack. We shall travel to the Anoat system here, then move across to Saleucami. So far out of our way? Unfortunately, we must avoid these neutral systems. Excuse me, Master Jedi. Yes, Admiral. Commander Tano, your presence is requested by prisoner Letta Turmond. The prisoner from the hangar bombing? Why is she asking for Ahsoka? Not exactly sure. But Commander Tano is the only person the prisoner will speak to. I'll report back with whatever I find out. Yes? I'm Commander Tano. Letta Turmond requested to see me. A lot of innocent people died in that blast. Good job capturing her. All right, scan her. Leave your comlink and lightsabers here. Follow me. What do you want, Letta? I was told if I ever needed help, you were the Jedi to contact. Give us a minute, please. You don't have much time, Letta, so I suggest you get whatever you have to say off your chest. The idea of feeding Jackar the nano-droids was not mine. Why are you saying this now? Why didn't you reveal this before? Because my life is in danger. The person behind this will be able to get to me unless you know the truth. Huh. What's the truth? A Jedi. A Jedi showed me how to create the bomb and how to put the nano-droids in. Why would a Jedi do this? There are some citizens of the Republic, like myself, who believe the Jedi Order is not what it used to be. The Jedi have become warmongers. They've become military weapons. And they're killing when they should be keeping the peace. One of these Jedi agreed with us. One of you wanted to make a statement and was willing to attack your own order to do it. Who? If you protect me, I will tell you, because it is obvious to me that I have been set up. Letta, you have to tell me who is behind this. It's Letta! Letta! Letta! Prisoner health critical, holding cell 173. Commander Fox, the prisoner. Follow me. Letta! I don't know what happened. Commander, she's dead. I can't say I blame you, Commander Tano. But all the same, you're under arrest. I No, no. I did not do this. Admiral Tarkin, I don't know what happened. I went in the room to talk to Letta, and she said she was afraid of a Jedi. You don't have to tell me any more, Commander Tano. I don't? No. There are recorders in every room. Curiously, the sound isn't working on this one. It seems the Jedi she was afraid of was you. I did not kill that woman. You were the only one there. I know that you were upset when this woman was taken into custody by the military. That means nothing. I beg to differ. It was someone else, Admiral, someone I didn't see. You know that is very difficult for me to believe. This is a secure facility. We do not have just anyone running about. And if there was someone else, why did you not sense them? I said my Padawan is in there. Now, step aside. General Skywalker, Admiral Tarkin has ordered that no one be allowed in there. I don't care what she's accused of. Let me in. Sorry, sir. The admiral's orders stand. This is now a military operation and under his jurisdiction. A key card. Master, I knew you wouldn't let me down. I wonder what you have planned. Oh, no. This does not look good. My lightsabers. Hello? Who is this? Why are you helping me? What's going on here? It wasn't me. Alert! Alert! The Jedi prisoner has escaped. Commander Tano, stop! She's heading north in the prison corridor. Cut her off! Copy that. Oh, no. The suspect has killed three clones. Code red. If you see the target, shoot to kill. Belay that order, Commander Fox. She's killed troopers. I know Commander Tano. She would never do something like this. Then who did? Quiet! Ahsoka! It's me, Anakin. Stop running. You can't help me, Master. Someone's setting me up. I believe you, Ahsoka. But no one else will. Keep searching until we find her. Rex, call security. Tell them we need to search the entire base. Now! General Skywalker has just issued an all-points bulletin on Commander Ahsoka Tano. She's killed three clones and should be considered armed and dangerous. The prisoner was just spotted in the east wing, cell block 1218-11. Come on, Grizzer. There's nothing here. There she is! Quick, stop her before she gets to the ship! All right, don't lose her. We'll be right there. What's going on? We've found her. She's heading towards the industrial pipeline. Set weapons to stun. I want her alive! Do not shoot to kill. Do not shoot to kill! Try to box her in. Don't let her escape. Tell me what you see, Oddball. She's moving west along the central viaduct. All right, we got her now. This will knock her off her feet. Not so fast, Commander. Ahsoka! Ahsoka, what are you doing? You didn't even try to come and help me. They wouldn't let me in to talk to you. You could have if you tried. How would that look, Ahsoka, huh? Forcing my way in would've made you look even more guilty. I'm not guilty! Then we have to prove you're innocent. The only way we can do that is by going back. I don't know who to trust. Listen, I would never let anyone hurt you, Ahsoka, never. But you need to come back and make your case to the Council. No. I'm not going to take the fall for something I didn't do! I am ordering you to put down your lightsaber and come with me now! Trust me. General Skywalker, where are you? I do trust you. But you know as well as I do that no one else will believe me. Anakin, you have to trust me now. Ahsoka, I do trust you. I know you do.

Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano are caught in the middle of a treacherous battle between good and evil. The scales now tipped toward the dark side, our three warriors must guard against attack as they plan their escape. A great weight has been placed on Anakin's shoulders, for it is now that he must face who he really is. I'm getting a little tired of how unreliable the weather is here. Some might say that's part of the appeal. You did well, Anakin. How do you feel? I'm not sure we're doing the right thing by leaving. The son is consumed by the dark side. And if we stay, we may be used to the dark side's advantage. Well, you want the bad news Or the really bad news? Well, let's try the bad news, laced with a little optimism. We've got two cracked shilo pins, a busted power converter, the engines should be fired twice to dump debris, and the backup vents need charging. Sounds terribly downbeat. Can it be fixed? I can reroute the primary initiator, weld the dampening vents, and that might give us enough power to leave the atmosphere. After that, I have no guarantees she'll hold together. We'll take our chances. Better than staying here. Where are you going? To see the father. I'm not convinced that the son will be contained here without our help. Perhaps we should make a stand. Anakin if I don't get the father's it'll haunt me forever. > Forgive me, daughter. I am an old fool who believed he could control the future. Now you are gone And all is lost. Sleep well, my child. Sleep free. You should have left by now. Our ship needs repairs. Do not underestimate my son. He will seek your ship to escape our isolation and sow terror through the universe. And while you are here, he will use you to do it. What will you do now that he's given himself over to the dark side? It is my actions that have unleashed great danger on the universe. I must kill him. But he's too powerful for you alone. Hmm, perhaps, perhaps not. The force will decide. I can help you. The choice is no longer yours to make. Both our destinies are clouded. This place is strong with the force. Darkness has no hold here. Go, ask, you have grown strong and powerful, just as I imagined. Master. Do you believe you are the chosen one? How can I know? I can tell you what I believe. I believe you will bring balance to the force, that you will face your demons and and this creature of the dark side? Do I leave, or do I stay and kill him? Neither. Look deeper. You will find another way. I don't understand. Not far from here, there is a place which is strong in the dark side of the force. You must go there. And destroy the son? Remember your training, Anakin. Trust your instincts. Master. Master! Might I suggest less sleeping and a little more work? Sorry, master Kenobi. Here. This should help. We need to change plans. You must focus on the firing drives. Disengage them. But I'm almost finished putting this junk heap back together, and now just do as I say. We don't have much time. Well, you're the boss. Where's Anakin? He came to me for guidance, but at the crossroad, only he can choose. The force will be his guide now. I don't like this. What have you done? I have done nothing. I am merely letting the will of the force take shape. Where has he gone? To the well of the dark side. Welcome. I believe there has been a misunderstanding. We really don't have to be enemies. You murdered your sister. The force is out of balance. I have to stop you. Must you? [Lightsaber hums] Anakin has gone to confront your son, hasn't he? Deep within this planet all that is dark is channeled. And how do I get there? You cannot interfere. The way I see it, if we were not supposed to interfere, Ahsoka and I wouldn't be here in the first place. Look after the ship. I'm going to find Anakin. [Lightsaber humming] There is no use for such crude implements here. I have a gift for you. I've had enough of your trickery. Oh, but you'll like this one. I promise. What if I could show you the future? No! No! Stop it! Know yourself. Know what you will become! [Moaning] I will not look! The force is strong with you. Anakin, please! You were my brother, Anakin! A powerful sith you will become. I hate you! No. No. No! I will do such terrible things. Yes. But it doesn't have to be that way. The choice is still yours to make. How? The future by its nature can be changed. Join me, and together we will destroy this emperor you see in your visions. Then we shall end war, corruption, and suffering throughout the galaxy. Will we bring peace? Of course. [Faint tapping and beeping] [Static crackling] Finally! This is jedi shuttle 634 calling on all secure channels for help. Do you read? I repeat: We are stranded and need immediate evac. Come in, please! Anakin, are you all right? There has been sorry. You will not understand what I have to do to end the clone war. [Screams] Anakin, why? I'm sorry. I have seen that it is the jedi who will stand in the way of peace. He's mine now. [Cackles maniacally] Ahsoka, come in, please. Can you hear me? Ahsoka! Yes, master. Any success with Anakin? No, quite the opposite. Master What are you saying? Anakin has joined with the son. Do not engage him. But just do as I say. Listen to me. You have to disable the ship. But I just finished putting it back together. Ahsoka, please listen. We have to prevent Anakin and the son from leaving. Yes, master. Ahsoka, what have you done? Ahsoka! [Grunts and gasps] Hmm, nice job. What took you so long? Here. I did as you said. The shuttle's going nowhere without that. Good, that gives us some time to rescue Anakin. I can't make contact with anybody. I don't think anyone will hear my signal. My father still has hold over this realm, but I will be able to draw any ship here soon. If I know my old master, he, too, will try to stop us. Together with your father, they would be a formidable opponent. I can turn the tide stay here. What did he show you? I've seen what I become, and I cannot let that happen. And for this, you join him? Your destiny can change just as quickly as the love in one's heart can fade. Nothing is set in stone. But I will cause so much pain. If there is to be balance, what you have seen must be forgotten. So cold. It's ironic, my sister. I truly loved. Where am I? I have brought you back to my monastery. [Sighs] What happened? My son broke the laws of time and showed you what you should never have seen. I don't remember. I have erased that time. We shall never know. Master! Are you all right? I think so, but we must stop the son once and for all. We have little time, and you'll get only one chance. You know what you must do. How quaint, my own personal send-off. I ask you one last time. Do not leave, my son. You have no power to keep me, old man. You must understand by now, this planet is not my destiny. What you will do will destroy all that is good. I beg you, restrain yourself and stay. I cannot. And then it shall be. I love you, my son. Do you?

You and I are tied together, runs through me. This way, I take your power. [Gasps] Please, don't die. I always knew there was good in you. [Lightsaber hums] [Gasps and groans] And so you have betrayed me, father. [Gasping] It is done. And now I die, my heart broken, the role you will play. And what is that? You are the chosen one.

After a massive planetary siege, the Separatist forces on Geonosis have finally fallen. Key weapons factories have been destroyed but at a heavy cost to Republic troops. Now, as Jedi Master Luminara Unduli  and Obi-Wan Kenobi begin a cleanup of the planet, they launch an intense campaign  to find separatist leader Poggle the Lesser and bring him to justice. Sorry to leave you here, Rex. There's still a lot to do. You two have done enough destroying that factory. Go get some rest. We'll let General Kenobi take it from here. We'll be back before you know it. We're ready, sir. A hard-won victory. Indeed. And a costly one. We suffer a great many losses in these battles. Too many. The battles do appear to be coming with growing frequency. No sign of Poggle, then? Nothing. We have clone squadrons spread out all over the area but no hits yet. I'll go out and find some clue as to where he went. - I'm sure the clones can handle - Poggle has too much information about the Separatists to let him get away. Very well, Master Unduli. Just make sure to leave a bit of strategic planning for me when I come back, Master Kenobi. I'd hate to feel left out. We lost one. Lord Poggle says leave it. We got to keep moving. What's this? I didn't expect to find you up and about. After enough time in a bacta tank, one longs for the mundane comfort of star charts. It seems like it did you some good. Your wound looks almost healed. I wish I could say the same for most of my men. Let's make sure we don't have to take Geonosis a third time. Poggle's forces seem to have come from the northern hemisphere. And where was Master Unduli's last contact made from? This region farther to the west, but there's nothing out there according to our latest intel. There. - Where? - 150 klicks southeast. It appears to be a munitions container of some kind. It could just be debris. I don't think so. There was no battle in this area. It looks like Poggle was on a direct course, Headed directly for the Progate Temple. That makes no sense. Nothing in the temple could have survived the munitions we used in the first wave of our attack. Why would he risk exposure to go there? I'm not yet sure. Perhaps he doesn't realize the extent to which we cleared that area. I'm tracking a sandstorm that's heading your way. No matter. Poggle is out in the open, and I intend to grab him before he can get offworld. I advise against it. You might get lost in the storm. Then we'd have to find both you and Poggle. I feel it is a risk worth taking. As you wish. Let's go. O.M.5, are you still there? I think I'm right next to you. Where is Lord Poggle taking us? Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Don't leave me. I can't track Poggle in this storm. We'll reach the temple soon. We can get out of the storm there. What could be taking her so long? - Something must have happened. - Patience, Skywalker. It's a delicate operation. I'm sure we'll have more information soon. I must admit, I am troubled that we've not heard from her. Let's not start worrying yet. Luminara's not one to take unnecessary risks. You were right. He's here somewhere. We tracked Poggle to the Progate Temple, but now there's no sign of him. Go no further until we can send support. It's difficult with the storm We can barely read your transmission as it is. Are you sure he went into the temple? We saw him enter, but I think he's gone down into the catacombs below. Those catacombs go on for miles. I fear we may have lost him. Get yourself out of there. We've lost the connection. Where are you going? - Take a guess. - We'll never get to her in this storm. The gunships can't handle it. We can't wait. I'm sorry, Skywalker. We have no choice. We must be patient and trust in Master Unduli. We'll leave as soon as the storm lifts. Stay alert, everyone. Spread out and look around, men. Buzz is dead. - Any sign of Luminara? - No, sir. There was a struggle. This is not a good sign. Luminara's lightsaber. Poggle didn't do this. But maybe that did. That is one ugly bug. I haven't seen one that looks like that before. I don't believe anyone has. It could be the Geonosian queen. The bugs have a queen? Rumored. But we haven't found any proof of her existence. Until now. This way. Come on, then. Let's move. This leads to a dead end. This one goes down the furthest. - Sir, I'd say that's our best bet. - I'll go first. Master Kenobi. If you're following me, you must leave this place. Just get out. I repeat, fall ba She must be close by. Come on. I don't like the looks of this. Look out! I can't stop them. Back, everyone, back! Take out the tunnel supports. It's the only way. What were those things? We couldn't kill them. I've heard stories of a Geonosian hive mind so powerful, so strong, that it can maintain its connection with its warriors even after they have died. And you think that's why we couldn't kill them, - because they're - Already dead, yes. That can't be true. That's impossible. Impossible or not, these creatures keep moving after we cut them up or shoot them down. Call for reinforcements. There's no signal. We must be too deep underground. You two, head back to the surface and contact General Mundi. Tell him we need reinforcements. I won't be unhappy to get out from under all this dirt. This place gives me the shivers. Wind's probably playing tricks on us, right? Look around. There's nothing What the? Blast 'em! - They're not going down! - We have to turn back! Gearshift! Obviously the thing's a lot more powerful than we assumed. I'm going to the surface to alert General Mundi myself. I think that would be a foolhardy move, Anakin. We can't divide our troops again. We don't have time to double back to the surface. Every moment we waste puts Luminara in greater danger. The air is warmer here. We must be getting close. Forget the heat. - It smells down here. - Keep your voice down. I'm just saying, this planet is rotten from the inside out. I've got a bad feeling about this. It must be the queen. Any sign of Luminara? I see her. She's suspended near the throne. Perfect. What about Poggle? He's speaking with the queen. Good. You take the soldiers, I'll take the queen. Must you always rush into things? You don't actually want to talk to it, do you? Matter of fact, I do. Anakin, don't you wonder why they took Luminara captive? Why not just kill her? She's leverage. She's a hostage. Leverage for what? No, there's something else going on here, and these zombies are connected to it. Fine. We'll try it your way. So glad you agree. Set your men up around the perimeter. These creatures live in darkness. The light from your helmet should blind them temporarily. Turn your lamps on at my signal. They should create enough confusion for us to get Luminara out of here. But what happens when the bugs pursue? You've seen them in action, sir. We can't kill them. We'll have to bury them. It'll at least slow them down. Shoot out the support pillars and this whole place will collapse. Let's go. How did you know they wouldn't just attack us? Because I make observations while you think with your lightsaber. That quick thinking of mine is usually need when your observations get us into trouble. Anakin, the queen took Luminara hostage. She wanted a Jedi. Now she has two more. I want to know what she's after. When this doesn't go as planned, which it won't, I'll be ready. That is so reassuring. I thought I told you not to follow me, Master Kenobi. I took a lesson from Anakin and decided not to follow orders. You are the creatures that attacked Geonosia. Why have you come before me? Your Majesty, it is a pleasure to finally meet you. I am Obi-Wan Kenobi, and this is Anakin Skywalker. It is our sad duty to inform you that your rule is at an end. You not dictate to me, Jedi. My Empire is forever. I'm afraid it does not appear that way, Your Grace. You shall release the Jedi Luminara and submit to Republic law. I no submit to you! Patience, Anakin. Wait. Majesty, destroying us shall only make the Republic's judgment of you harsher. I no destroy you. I devour you. I control you. I had but one Jedi before young Poggle bring me. But now I have three. Now, watch as my child enters your Jedi friend. And once inside, her mind becomes my mind. Her thoughts, my thoughts. It's a sort of mind control, a hive mind. - She thinks she can possess us. - Great. - Find out  all you wanted to know yet? - No, wait. I want to see how it works. I don't think Luminara wants to see how it works. No, I don't. I'm curious. The more we know, the better. I disagree. So do I. Come now. The nose or the ear, which do you think it will enter? I think the nose. I hope this is part of the plan. Isn't it always? Cody, now! You're coming with us, Poggle. Obi-Wan, look out! Got it. What are you doing? I was going to study that. Study the bottom of my boot. Come on. Let's get out of here. Here they come. Take out the supports! They're still coming! This is our way out. Start climbing. Obi-Wan, look out! All things considered That went better than I expected. I wish we could have gotten one of those worms. Knowing how the queen controls her minions could have proven valuable. Hopefully the secret is buried with her.

With the clone army stretched in a desperate attempt to engage General Grievous' starfleet, Separatist planets that were once thought secure are now rising up against the Republic. On Geonosis, Separatist leader Poggle the Lesser, safe in his newly ray-shielded factories, creates thousands of terrible new weapons which march off the assembly line against the outnumbered clone army. The Jedi, resolute in their effort to restore order to the Republic mount a massive invasion to retake Geonosis and shut down Poggle's factories of terror once and for all. I cannot believe we're back here again. It is unfortunate. The resistance from the native Geonosians was stronger than we anticipated. The same can be said for their loyalty to Count Dooku. A fact that is often overlooked. You're late. Sorry, Master. Ahsoka and I were busy routing the seppies near Dorin. My squadron alone had 55 kills. Yeah, but mine had 76. Show-off. I'm glad you two are enjoying yourselves. It's just a little friendly competion, Master. Nothing to worry about. What I worry about is the way this war seems to be drawing out with no end in sight. Which is why it is crucial our invasion of Geonosis meets with success. Agreed. Contact the Outer Rim command. We're ready for our briefing. They're already waiting for us. Our ships are in position, and we are ready to begin our campaign against the Geonosians. And what about Poggle? Any report on his location? It seems he's holed up at the primary droid foundry here. The factory is protected by a shield generator. Anakin, Ki-Adi, and I shall attempt a three-pronged attack through their defense lines to a staging area just short of the shield. Once we have landed, we Shall knock out the shield generator That is our primary target. Isn't it risky committing three generals to one area of the attack? If something went wrong, we could be dealt a serious blow. To ensure that rise again Geonosis does not, capture Poggle we must. Of course. As always, I shall leave the strategy to you, Master Jedi. Our thanks, Chancellor. May the Force be with you. Good, Cody. These are the coordinates for the rendezvous. When we hit the ground, we'll create a perimeter. Getting past their defenses here will be the trick. General Mundi will come across the defensive lines from the north. We will make our assault through the middle. General Skywalker will make his attack on the defensive lines from the south, And we will meet at the rendezvous point at 0700 exactly If we meet with strong resistance and are forced down away from the landing zone, hold out until we join our forces before attacking the shield generator. Their front lines are heavily fortified. Look at that giant wall with all the gun emplacements. That won't be easy to get past. Don't worry. We're not going anywhere near that. Come now. What happened to all the enthusiasm I saw earlier? Don't worry about us. You just make sure you get yourself to that landing zone in one piece. I shall be waiting for you when you finally arrive. Gentlemen, if you are quite finished we have a battle to begin. Quite right. Cody, prep the gunships. I'll meet you in the hangar. No, sir, I wasn't involved in the first assault on Geonosis. You didn't miss much. Last time, I was chained to a pole and attacked by several humongous monsters. That sounds entertaining. It was for the Geonosians. - We all ready, Rex? - Yes, sir. General Kenobi is already under way. He's got a head start. We'll have to catch up. Good luck, General. There is no such thing as luck. Good thing those bugs can't aim. - The flak is too heavy. - We're down. Repeat, down. Location, five I just lost contact with Skywalker's team. Come on, get up! We have to keep moving. Here they come. Watch it. Watch it! They're falling back. Come on! Get the tanks on the ground now! Cody, get the tanks down. Come in, Cody. Cody, come in! Get the tanks down! Copy that. Pilot, begin landing sequence. Copy that, commander. Have fun down there. Move it! Move it! - Here they come. - Bugs incoming. Man down! Man down! General Kenobi, don't land. The zone is hot. But there's nowhere else to go. We're hit. We're going down. Brace yourselves! What are our losses, captain? We got hit pretty hard. I think only Kenobi's forces made it through the flak - to the landing zone. - And what about Skywalker? Captain Rex reported they're still in the middle of a firefight. Skywalker's tanks are gone, and they're trying to contact General Kenobi's forces for support. In the meantime, they'll press on to the rendezvous point. Very well. Load the injured onto the tanks. We'll make for that ridge. With any luck, we can meet up with Skywalker on his way to Kenobi's position. - I'll speak with General Skywalker. - Rex, what's the word? - Can Obi-Wan send support or not? - I don't think so, sir. Cody says General Kenobi never reached the landing site. - They think his gunship got shot down. - Great. The one time I actually ask Obi-Wan for help, he's nowhere to be found. What if something happened to General Kenobi? - He could be injured or - No time for that kind of talk. We need to mobilize now. Get the men together. - We're gonna rush the guns. - Yes, sir. Ahsoka, you're with me. We need to give Rex cover when we attack. Got it. Just give the word. I'm worried about him too. But you have to keep your mind in the here and now, otherwise we'll never be able to help Obi-Wan. - All here, sir. - Ready? Take 'em out. Take 'em all. Not good. The bugs are splitting up. - Boil reporting as ordered, sir. - Waxer reporting as ordered, sir. We have a downed gunship 5 klicks east. We believe it's General Kenobi's. I need you to get out there and check for survivors. Why do we always get the fun missions? Tthis isn't the fun part. Getting back to the square is the fun part. Am I glad to see you. Trapper and I are the only ones still alive. Good to see you, sir. Commander Cody's established the square just beyond this position. The bugs are on the move and trying to surround us as we speak, sir. They've got the General. AT-TE 636, lay down cover fire at point 3-5. Take it down! Take it down! - Are you injured, General? - No, nothing too serious. What's the situation here? We've got no air cover, two generals on the ground beyond our position, and a mess of bugs surrounding us. The enemy was more than prepared for our attack, sir. They knew our every move. I'm sure General Skywalker and General Mundi will make it to our position. We just have to make sure we're still here when they arrive. Negative, captain. We will be unable to provide any air support at this time. I understand that, sir. But we have 3 attack forces on the ground and only one at the landing zone. This is a planetary-wide invasion, captain. If I devote resources to your position, it will mean sacrificing other areas of the campaign. All we can do at this time is help you find General Skywalker. All right, sir. I'll report to the General. Commander jet out. Give me every fighter you can scrape up. Have you located General Skywalker's position? We think he's somewhere along the eastern barrier. That's not a barrier. It's a fortress. Careful, men, careful. Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten us into. What? Hey, it's not my fault. You were supposed to study the holomaps. I did! Remember when I reminded you about the giant wall, and you said, \"Don't worry, Snips. We won't be anywhere near that. \" Just get ready to climb. General, I left a squad to protect the tanks. Are you sure this is the shortest way to the landing zone? No, I'm not sure, commander. All I can do is trust my instincts. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I have a wing vibration up ahead. Don't stop. We must push on. Forward! - So what's the plan, General? - Just keep us covered, Rex. There's too much laser fire for all of us to make the climb. Ahsoka and I will handle this. Just be ready when that wall comes down. How many droids have you shot down so far? - 25. - You're falling behind. Let's go. Focus on the droids on the top of the wall. Man down! Look for a hatch. We need to put the explosives inside the wall. Found one. - Did you get them? - Catch. Come on, Rex. Up and away. Help! Next time, just tell me to jump. Now, where's the fun in that? Come on, we can't keep Obi-Wan waiting. You heard him, lads. Let's go! We're almost through. Bring in the flame throwers. Look, what's that? Master Mundi, do you read me? We are here, Skywalker. We took a slight detour that put us out of communications for a bit. This has been a day for detours, Master. Indeed. But now the road is clear. I can see the landing zone. It does not look good. Can you get me Admiral Yularen? Admiral, we're at the breaking point. You've got to get some fighters down here. You are in luck, General Skywalker. I have one squadron available. Retreat! Go, go, go, go! Every shot counts! Give it all you got! Reinforcements! The reinforcements have arrived! Go, go, go, go! Move it! Move it! - You heard him, lads, let's go! - Up to the front! - Come on! - Hurry, hurry! - There they are. - Move it, move it! Master Kenobi. What happened to you? I might ask you the same question. Our combined forces should be enough to destroy the shield generator. Anakin, you'll need to take a small squad through the shield, as close as you can get to their gun emplacements. From there, you'll be able to temporarily jam their scanners so they are unable to target the incoming tanks. Once the tanks knock out the shield, Master Mundi can bring the rest of the troops in with the gunships. Consider it done, Master. All units are in position, sir. Tell Skywalker to start the attack. Begin the attack. Let's jam their scanners. Droid poppers ready. Looks like it's working. It won't last long. Bring up the tanks. So, Master, what was your total? Not now, Ahsoka. Come on. Are you afraid you lost this time? Fine. 55, that's my count. And you? Looks like I won. Yeah, but I called in the air strike. Tie. You're impossible. I'll never understand how you can simplify these battles into some kind of game. Take care of yourselves. I expect to see both of you back here by the time I've destroyed the main factory. We shall do our best. - I'm sorry? My total. 65. So what do I win? My everlasting respect, Master Mundi. That is a gift Anakin rarely bestows, I assure you.   \n                "}, "A Necessary Bond": {"episode": "s05e09", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tPursued by pirates!

Marshalling their courage and training, the younglings infiltrated the pirate stronghold and rescued Ahsoka. Now we find our heroes in a race to their starship, with the pirates closing in. I know. I see them. They're gaining on us! Uh, I think they're still upset that we tricked them. They'll get over it once we're off their planet. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Right. Ganodi, we need a quick evac. Come in, please. Ganodi. Maybe the pirates are jamming the signal. Where could she be? Ganodi. Huyang. Come in. Attaching your head took a lot longer than I thought it would. It is appreciated, youngling. Mobility is paramount, especially in an emergency. Ganodi, where are you? I'm here. I was in the back fixing Huyang. Great. That's great. But we're all gonna need repairs if you don't have the engines running. Where are you? Ganodi, it's Ahsoka. Padawan Tano! We've rescued you. Almost. But we need you to get us home. Are you ready? Just tell me what I need to do. Okay, fire up the engines and head to these coordinates. We'll be right there. There they are! Artoo, hold her steady and lower the boarding ramp. Come on! Looks like our ride is here. Everyone get topside and stay down. But who's going to pilot the tank? Katooni, grab that mask. Uh, that'll have to do. The steering must have come loose. We got him! Hang on! Oh, no. No, no, no! They're coming back! Artoo, get out of there now! Everyone, let go! Jump down now. Nice try, little Jedi. But it looks like you're coming with us. What the-- Droids? It's an invasion. Boss! Boss! We're all in trouble! Gah! Hondo. General Grievous, I presume? What a surprise. Have a seat. What, may I ask, is the honor? You can dispense with the pleasantries, pirate. This planet is now under Separatist control. Uh-huh. And what do you suppose that means? It means you have a new master, pirate scum. Hondo Ohnaka, we meet again. As I recall the last time we met face-to-face, I was your prisoner. Uh And you attempted to barter me off to the highest bidder. But can you blame me? I mean, a Sith Lord. What a handsome price you would-- - Silence! You are going to pay the price for your treachery. Well, I'm a reasonable man. Name the price. I'm sure we can reach-- - There will be payment, but no deals-- only demands. Your entire arsenal will be melted down. Everything you own is now property of the Separatist Alliance. Now you go too far! Unacceptable! This is an outrage. This-- Hold on. We can make a deal. This is not good business! This isn't good. Those scrappin' droids are looting the place. They're dismantling our ships. The fact that Grievous is here with his entire fleet means that Master Kenobi must have been overrun. This entire system is now in Separatist controlled space. What should we do? There's nowhere to run. You're not running anywhere, skug. You're still my prisoner. Maybe I can trade you to the Separatists in exchange for my freedom. Not likely. Grievous didn't come here to make deals. He already controls the planet and the system. If you hand us over to him, he'll kill us and then you. We have a common enemy in Grievous. Together, we can get out of this. You must have some other ships somewhere. You are pirates. Hondo's got a private fleet, but only he knows where the ships are. Then we'll have to rescue him. I know Grievous. And I know droids. With my help, you stand a better chance. You got yourself a deal, Jedi. Halt. You captured this tank? Not bad for an astromech. What's your ID number? Hey, do not get smart with me. I outrank you. You just watch yourself. I could have you melted down with the rest of this junk. That's right. Now take it over to Hangar 12. And no detours. We'll be watching you. Jedi. And here I thought you made your escape, no? No. There were complications. Now, we have to put our differences aside and be friends, or else we're all gonna die here. Ah, very diplomatic. Ha! I knew you did not come back to rescue Hondo, how do you say it? Out of the goodness of your hearts. No, no, no, no. You need something from me. A ship, to be specific. Ah, yes. A ship, a ship. Ah, but where would we find one of those? My new friend General Grievous has destroyed my ships. We know you have one, a whole pirate fleet. And one of my old friends, apparently, has been talking too much. Ah, what does it matter? We'll never reach the vault anyway. Grievous' army is way too big. Don't give up. We can fight. If I may, sir. I have instructed younglings for over 1,000 generations, and these are among the best I have ever seen. Well, then, show me. Show me your swords, tiny Jedi. Show Hondo you are ready to fight. Ah. And you, child. Where is your saber? It's not finished. I never finished it. I've done everything right, but it won't work. You must trust that the components that form your lightsaber are meant to be together. There is no other way. It is the Force that binds them. Yes, I was just going to say that. Finish it now. Finish, finish! This is worth the price of a ship. To see the construction of a Jedi lightsaber, this--this is priceless. Finish it, and together, we can defeat Grievous. Oh. Amazing. That is truly amazing. Well, cut me down, little Jedi. It's time to leave. So why the big show? You didn't really have a choice. You know we have to work together. Because, Jedi, you know what we are about to attempt is very dangerous. And I may be a pirate, but I do not like taking children into battle. That didn't seem to bother you when you attacked us. Well, today is a new day, and lucky for you, today, I like children. Now, let's free the rest of my men. This is OOM-87, General. The prison area is under attack. There are several miniature Jedi here. What? You aren't making any sense. What Jedi? The little ones, half the size of normal Jedi. They're freeing the prisoners and-- my knees! Prepare to open fire. We will bring the building down on their heads. I got your back. Great. I feel so safe. They run. Quickly. After them. They went the wrong way. Don't worry. What about the others? We can't just leave them. You are welcome to come, small one. You may join our merry band of pirates. I won't just run away. Ahsoka trusted you. We all trusted you. Artoo, do something. I don't know. We have to shake Grievous off. Get aggressive. Ah! Too aggressive. Far too aggressive. Yes, well, it was an effective strategy, but not what I would recommend. So many lightsabers to add to my collection. Hurry! Come on! Run. All of you run! Ha! Ahsoka! Come on! Ahsoka, come on! You will never defeat Grievous. Never! I wouldn't be so sure. Did we get him? I can't tell. Show is over, kiddies. Let's get out of here. And let me see. Oh, the cost of the fuel. I had to use a lot of fuel. The general wear and tear on my men and equipment. A couple of them died, I think. Believe me, Kenobi. Staging a rescue is not an inexpensive proposition. So you mean to tell me you were staging a rescue, not attempting to hijack a Jedi starship? You're welcome! Oh, the thanklessness! What an accusation. I am gone! I will send you my bill! Ahsoka. It's good to see you're all safe. Yes, Master. We had quite an eventful mission. The most eventful since the time Master Yoda went to find his lightsaber crystal. What? Oh! - Tell us! - What happened then? I'm afraid that story will have to wait. For now, be proud. You have survived an ordeal few your age could. Welcome home, young Jedi.   \n                "}, "Blue Shadow Virus": {"episode": "s01e17", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t{\\fad(1000,0)Fear is a disease;  Battle droids on Naboo. As the Separatist rebellion rages through the galaxy, even peaceful planets are threatened. Following the discovery of Separatist droids wandering the grassy wasteland, Naboo is once again on high alert. Fearing their home is facing another invasion, Senator Amidala and Representative Binks race to Naboo to assess the situation. Meanwhile, near the Gungan swamplands, an even graver threat is about to be discovered. We came as soon as we could, My Lady. Have you found any more droids? Only the three. But you can be sure they aren't tourists. I need you to convince the Senate or the Jedi Council or whoever is in charge of this terrible war that we are threatened. They'll need more proof. Finding a couple of battle droids will not be enough. Captain Typho, the battle droid is ready for analysis. Have you been able to retrieve any information? Unfortunately, the Naboo security who discovered them prefer to shoot first and retrieve data later. If they were found in the grasslands, where'd they pick up all this mud? Add that to our very long list of questions. Yummy-yummy. I'm getting a bad feeling about this. With your permission, Senator Padm\u00e9, I would like to shut down before I get sensory overload. - Permission denied. - Denied? some information out of him. Cannot see. Where am I? You are in very good hands on board a Separatist ship. Count Dooku himself intends to reward you for your bravery. - Bravery? - For your assignment on Naboo. Do try to activate what's left of your memory. We all want to hear your tale of medical heroics. Virus. Yes, the virus. You do remember. Please continue. A small amount leaked out. Must contain. Naboo cannot know. Lab must remain secret. A secret lab on Naboo? Where? You must It is a secret. This is no Separatist ship. Unless you want to become a box of spare parts, you'll tell us where that lab is. - The lab is secret. - Look out. We'll never get any information out of him now. Meesa sorry. It was accident. Is - This what you're after? - Meesa love him. He's a very, very good tongue grabbing. Yousa finden in one placen. Where? In the mud under the perlote tree. Like the mud on this droid. The eastern swamps. I think Jar Jar just found out the location of that lab. They're planning an attack on Naboo. It's the only explanation. Delicate the situation is. Two Jedi we will send. May I recommend General Kenobi and General Skywalker? Relations with the Gungans are a little tense right now, but they trust General Kenobi like one of their own. Send them we will. I want as much information as possible before the Jedi arrive. See if you and 3PO can download any of the other battle droid's memory. I'm going to find that lab. Are you sure that's wise? Come on, Jar Jar. Back! That water gone poodoo. This is muy bad. This is bombad. - Whatsa happen to them? - It's the plague. We're definitely getting close. - Whosa are you? - What you doing? Why yousa here? Whassa yousa thinkin'? Don't move. I don't want to hurt you. Jar Jar, put your helmet back on. Yousa okeyday. It's not in the air, it's in the water. Who are you? Meesa Peppi Bow. We think the virus that made your animals sick came from the perlote trees. Yousa follow thisa river. Yousa finda yousa perlote. Meesa take you. No, Peppi, you stay here. You'll be going home soon, I promise. I'll send some soldiers to pick you up and take you back to Theed. Keep your eyes open. Look for anything out of the ordinary. I suppose one can never have too many lab rats. Please, escort our guests inside. Roger roger. A hatch. Captain Typho, I think we're standing right on top of the lab. I need a geo scan of coordinates SP127. No way we're going to open this. - We'll just have to - Freeze. Hold it right there. Yousa let us go. Who are you? Why are you holding us? Wonderful specimens. What's a life-form like you doing in a swamp like this? I was about to ask you the same thing. Thanks to the support of my compassionate friends in the Separatist Alliance, I am creating life. Howsa yousa creating life? I'm so pleased you inquired. A demonstration is in order. Allow me to present the return of the infamous blue shadow virus. The blue shadow virus? I thought that deadly disease was extinct. Yes, it was wiped from the galaxy generations ago, but I have given it life once again. Yousa not creating life. Yousa taking life. Yousa poisoned the gungan water. Unfortunately, the blue shadow virus, in its natural form, thrives only in water until I improved upon that weakness. Your eyes do not deceive you. I have perfected an airborne strain of the blue shadow virus. This is the last of the bombs, doctor. I'm well aware this is the last. You think I'd lose count? The virus in its gaseous forms combined with these bombs will release the blue shadow virus back into the galaxy, more potent than ever before. Are you insane? It's a deadly disease. No life-forms are immune to it. That's why it was eradicated. You mean murdered. Take this away. Meanwhile, as we speak, thousands and thousands of so-called superior life-forms are spreading their disease of war throughout the galaxy. Perhaps they are the ones who should be eradicated. General Kenobi, Anakin, we're so glad Where's Senator Amidala? - She went to look for the lab. - And you let her go? Senator Padm\u00e9 can be very hard to stop once she has made up her mind. - Good point. I know what you mean. - This is Peppi Bow. She was the last person to see them. - Padm\u00e9 sent her here to safety. - Theysa looking for the sick maker. - \"They\"? - Representative Binks was with her. Go with the Gungan. See if you can find them. You've got it, Master. Why didn't you send someone to look for them? Considering the latest developments, we thought it was best to wait for you. What latest developments? We did a robo-lobotomy on the battle droids and came up with this piece of memory. Who is that? Dr. Nuvo Vindi, the senior medic for the Perma families. He disappeared ten years ago. Good news, my soulless automaton friends. We now have enough of the blue shadow virus - to start filling the bombs. He said \"bombs.\" We will only need to send one bomb to each key star system. Work quickly. I want them ready to deliver If those bombs get delivered, we'll be facing a galaxy-wide plague. The war will be the least of our worries. There is some good news. Senator Amidala found the lab. She sent us the coordinates before she disappeared. We've managed to get a geo scan of the area. - It's enormous. - It looks like there're 3 entry points: here, here, and here. This appears to be the main lab. And the bombs? There seems to be an above average amount of radiation in this area. It's likely where they're being assembled. If Padm\u00e9 has alerted them to our presence in any way If Padm\u00e9's in there, and then we go in guns a-blazin', she may get killed. It is a risk we have to take. Doctor Vindi and those bombs must not leave the lab. And if they or we detonate one during the attack? Better to have one planet infected than the entire galaxy. These the ship belonging to them. So where are they? Their tracks end here. Peppi, it's a scope. Don't let them see you. - Where are they? - Patience. They'll be here in a moment. You seem a bit on edge. There's a good chance we're about to destroy all life on this planet, including ours and the Senator's, so yes, I'm a bit on edge. - Why aren't you? - I'm better at hiding it. Master, are you there? - Did you find her? Negative. I'm pretty sure she's inside the lab. The whole area is wired with pressure sensors. There's no way to get in without being detected. - But I'm more than happy to - Do not attempt to get inside. I need you to detonate a bunker bomb at the south end of the facility. It should cause a nice distraction and seal off the bomb area while we come in through the hatches. You can count on me. Rex and his men will be right behind you. They'll have your back. Come on. We'd better hurry. Padm\u00e9 may be lost, Anakin. Don't risk the mission trying to rescue her. I'll take care of the bombs. You focus on the doctor. I know what's at stake here. Now! We have a breach! All droids to hatch number one! Friends of yours, I assume. They arrived quicker than I would've thought. - Meesa come too? - No. Stay here and make sure no one escapes. Okidee. It's quiet in here. Looks like Ahsoka's distraction is working. Forward! Come on! Fall back! Take another step and your friends die. Drop your weapons. Wait! Do as he says. I can't hold them. Need some help? So good to see you, Master Kenobi. I realize I won't be able to hold you for long, Jedi. That is why I'm going to give you a choice. Fine with me, as long as one of the options is killing you. How about capture me or save your friends? Are you okay? Ani, how about the next time you rescue me before you kill all the battle droids? A little \"thank you\" would go a long way. Things are going well. The lab is secure, and hopefully Anakin has reached Padm\u00e9 by now. I'll get the bombs. I'll keep the droids occupied. Grab your blasters. We need to find that doctor. Well, looks like the bomb room. Yes, and luckily, they appear inactive. I spoke too soon. Get these deactivated now! Anakin, I'm guessing you didn't capture the doctor. I'm working on it. Do you have the bombs? I'm working on it. Dr. Vindi has remotely activated the bombs. - They're counting down. - That's great. And on top of that, one of them seems to be missing. - It's down here somewhere. - Ahsoka, we've got another situation. Send all the clones to search the facility. - We've got a mis - Master? We've got a missing bomb and a trigger happy mad doctor on the loose. Missing bomb? I saw Dr. Vindi give a little droid a bomb. You guys split up. Find that droid. You heard him. Let's move! Jedi! Leaving so soon, doctor? You are running out of time. Catch! Obi-Wan, Dr. Vindi's escaping! He's at the landing platform. All right. I'm on my way. Something smells good in here. Hey, there, little guy. How about you hand that over to me? He's getting away! Ahsoka, I found the last bomb. Stay there. I'll get the bomb squad. Almost got it. Don't shoot. If he drops one of those vials, we're finished. No, no-sa! You're under arrest, Dr. Vindi. The bomb's going off, and we're all going to die! Yeah, die! What happened? Deactivated. Plenty of time to spare. Plenty of - Ahsoka, are you there? - I'm here, Master. The bomb has been deactivated. Did you find Vindi? Deactivated as well. Have you seen Padm\u00e9? She's right next to me. I'm okay too. Thanks for asking.   \n                "}, "Assassin": {"episode": "s03e07", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe future has many paths - choose wisely. Criminals Captured! Jedi master Plo Koon and padawan Ahsoka tano Successfully thwarted an attempt on mace windu's life, Killing bounty hunter aurra sing In the process. Since that time, young ahsoka has grown strong in the ways of the force. Now, after several harrowing adventures alongside her master, The two jedi have returned to the temple on coruscant to receive their next mission. Welcome, padawan. In order congratulations are. Shown your courage and strength yet again you have. Job well done, Ahsoka. And now onto more pressing matters. To balith you must go, Skywalker. There's a large-scale civil war on balith. They have requested our assistance. Anakin, you will leave immediately to command The third legion. I've never been to balith. You will stay here, padawan. We need your full report. As you wish. Ahsoka, I sense you're uneasy. What is it? I Nothing. Master, let me come with you. If I'm not with you, who else will have your back? Stay here, finish your studies, get some rest. You've said it yourself. I learn more in the field than I ever do here. Think of this as a chance to prove me wrong. And stay out of trouble. She will die, and there's nothing that you can do. Enter. Have a seat, young padawan. Troubled you are, padawan? Yes, master yoda. I've been having dreams. Dreams, you say? Yes, dreams. Or visions. I don't know. But they're so real. Premonitions. Telling you something they are. I know I reported otherwise, but I believe that aurra sing Isn't dead. She's still alive, and she's preparing to kill someone close to me. So you begin to see the true power of the force. Visions they are. Underestimate them, You must not. Meditate to see clearly. More experience you need. These should help you with your studies, dear. Study. I should be out there fighting, not in here studying. - Kill her. - With pleasure. Senator amidala is in danger. Senator. Padawan ahsoka tano is here to see you. Senator amidala. Ahsoka, It's so good to see you. How have you been? Honestly, I've been better. I'm worried for you, senator. I sense you are in grave danger. What makes you believe that? I've been having dreams Bad dreams. Padme, I know you're in danger. I just know it. what kind of danger? I believe that a very dangerous bounty hunter is out to assassinate you. This is troubling. Captain, please take all necessary precautions. You're leaving? Yes, Bail Organa and I are leading a conference, concerning the refugees from the war. I leave for alderaan In the morning. But the threat to your life Ahsoka, the refugee situation is much to crucial to ignore. I called this conference. It could make an enormous difference in policy. It's vital that I go. Yes, senator. I'm sure now that it is senator amidala who is in danger. Senator amidala, you say? Yes, master. I've seen it in my visions. Choose, you must, how to respond to your visions. But remember, always in motion is the future, and many possible futures there are. Yes, master. Senator! Ahsoka, what is it? I can't just stay behind knowing about the threat to your life. Allow me to come with you, please. Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt. Besides, I enjoy your company. Of course you can join me as extra security. Thank you, padme. You'll learn to play in time, Ahsoka. Someday you'll even beat me. It's not that. what's on your mind? I've been mostly unsure about my abilities on my own. Usually master skywalker is there to guide me. When I was queen, I felt the same insecurities as you do now. I had my advisors but, it was ultimately up to me to run the entire naboo system. And I was very afraid at times. Really? You felt unsure? Oh, yes. I've learned to trust In myself, and you will too. Thank you. - One more game? - Absolutely. it's begun. Padme! The assassin's inside! - Ahsoka. - Stay down. What's going on? Nothing. False alarm. Forgive me, senator. - Are you all right, my lady? - Yes, captain. I'm fine. - Padme! - Bail, It's so good to see you. Thank you so much for hosting this conference. Dealing with the refugees of this war needs to be Our number one priority. Absolutely. Your presence here is greatly appreciated. Come. Senator mothma and I will take you to your quarters. Senator, might I have a word with you in private? Of course, padawan tano. If you'll excuse me. I know I made a mistake last night. But that doesn't mean the threat to you is any less. I haven't lost faith in you, Ahsoka. I know. And I appreciate that. I don't mean to interject, but now is not the time for this. Senator amidala must prepare for her summit. But I believe the attempt on your life is going to happen tonight. Why tonight? I had another vision, and it was much clearer. I could see more than usual, even a location. It was large room, you were giving a speech. This room, could you recognize it if you saw it? Yes, I think I could. So es anything look familiar? Yes. This is it. This is the place I saw In my vision. Where would the assassin be? That's the part I'm not sure of. We are taking all the necessary precautions, correct, captain? Yes, milady. But aurra sing will know what you plan to do. She'll find a way in. Ahsoka, in your vision, does aurra succeed? I can't tell. Well, then, at least we have a fighting chance. Isn't it just beautiful? I really must insist you go back inside. It's not safe for you out here. Ahsoka, I can't stop living my life. You forget, I'm a friend of the jedi. I'm no stranger to taking risks. What is it? I'm confused. My visions are telling me one thing, but reality is telling me another. I don't know which to believe anymore. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe no one's out to kill you. As the conflict that divides our galaxy escalates, We cannot lose perspective, on the value of life and the price of freedom. No one knows this truth more Than the distinguished senator padme amidala of naboo. Thank you, senator organa. I wanted to first thank you all for coming. This is a cause that is very important to me. I can remember after the illegal blockade of my home world, Naboo, by the trade federation, how many lives were thrown into chaos. True, in the grand scale of things, it was a small conflict. And true, there was only one battle fought during the occupation. But t us examine the cost of that one conflict: Hundreds of naboo were forced from their homes, Naboo secuty forces and the Gungan army both incurred heavy casualties, And the life of jedi master Qui-gon jinn was lost. And yet now I find myself a party to and witness of a full-scale war that has divided our great republic in two. Already, more than 100 jedi have given their lives Get a medical droid. We need a medic. The senator will be fine. It was only a flesh wound. - I'm sorry. - For what, ahsoka? You did all you could. Did you find the assassin? She ran off before I could get her. - She? - Yes, she. I am positive now that it is Aurra Sing who is out to get you. Please return to coruscant immediately, for your own safety. Padme, I agree with the padawan. It is far too dangerous for you to give your speech tonight. If someone wants me dead, They will follow me wherever I go. But you know my visions are all mixed up. What if what I saw was the attempt that just happened? Padme, I'm not willing to gamble with your life. Wait a minute. I think I have a way we can get around putting you in jeopardy, And have you [] All clear, sir. The upper levels are cleared, captain. Sweep complete. The area is secure. Fear, in these times, it is the Greatest weapon wielded against those who would stand up for truth and justice. We have a responsibility as the elected representatives of the republic to face our fears and challenge those who threaten the safety of its people. I stand before you today bruised but not beaten. The voices of the people shall be heard. And together, we shall represent them. - The homeless shall no longer - Aurra's not here. - What do you mean, she's not here? - The soldiers who so valiantly, Fight to protect us must also be protected once their job is done. She's not in this room. We need legislation to defend the displaced from slavery, to protect our soldiers from feeling as if there is no future, beyond their warfare, and we must open channels through diplomacy, So that we can end this war. I know there are those among the separatists who would end this conflict. And I know there are those individuals in the galaxy who would seek to promote fe and spread chaos. To those that act as agents of chaos, I say this. I stand resolute and unyielding. And if you strike my voice down, Know that a chorus of thousands shall rise up in its place, For you have no dominion over the righteous. We are the defenders of truth. You! I remember you, jedi brat. Stand down, assassin. You left me for dead. Luckily, Hondo pulled me out of the wreckage. Surprised you're back to work so soon. Well, a girl's got to make a Living. Get this door open, now. Why are you doing this? Killing me will not stop the relief effort. Honey, this isn't about your cause. This is about revenge. My employer wants to get even with you, simple as that. Who hired you? Enough talk. Time to see what you're made of, kid. Nice shot. I told you, I'm no stranger to taking risks. - Senator. - Captain, She's stunned. Are you all right? Without ahsoka's foresight, I fear things would have gone quite differently. Serve you well, your visions have, young padawan. Thank you, master yoda. But we still don't know who's really behind this. Concentrate. Remember. What do you see? I see Shapes. Large Devouring. I hear Laughter Bizarre laughter. And Purple? I see a color. Purple. I don't know what it means. None of it is familiar to me. It is to me. I've been thinking. Aua sing said the person who hired her simply wanted for something I did to them. Well, that could be a lot of people. Yes. But with ahsoka's added details, I know someone who fits the description. Ziro. You must be anakin skywalker. Have you met my padawan, Ahsoka tano? Padawan. I believe you have a grudge against senator amidala. and what makes you say something so utterly ridiculous, youngling? it's because of senator amidala you're locked up in this place. The bounty hunter aurra sing attempted to kill the senator. I believe you hired her for the job. I did no such thing. We have aurra sing in custody. She told us everything. Waitshe told.. She told you what? Impossible. I should've hired someone Better. you just aranteed yourself an extra-long vacation in this lovely establishment. Do you see the conditions I'm living in? That insipid senator put me in here. She deserves to die for leaving me to rot in this squalor! Well, thanks to you, ziro, and that little confession, you've just officially failed. You'll never get away with this. You have no idea what I'm capable of!   \n                "}, "The Rise Of Clovis": {"episode": "s06e06", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t6x06 - \"The Rise of Clovis\"  War profiteers! In time of war, credits are the fuel that fund all operations. Senator Amidala is sent to Scipio to resolve matters between the Republic and the InterGalactic Banking Clan. Here she is reunited with Rush Clovis, a once-close friend, but now a known traitor to the Republic. When Clovis reveals corruption at the core of the Banking Clan, Senator Amidala helps him steal vital files that may uncover the full extent of the plot. Anakin Skywalker is sent to rescue the Senator and escort the information back to Coruscant, leaving the Banking Clan in chaos. The Jedi Anakin Skywalker should never have been allowed to leave with the Senator in tow. Any future disruptions will be placed upon your shoulders, Nix Card. As you wish. Sir, we have confirmed that Rush Clovis was on the Jedi ship. Then there's nothing we can do. But they have the files. Unfortunate, yes, but they need more than just files to incriminate us. That will only take them time. We will all be destroyed. We must remain calm. The only way they could find our secret accounts is if one of us told them. I want it noted that you and you alone allowed this to happen, and that it has put us all at risk. You're late. What news? Clovis, the Senator, and the Jedi are on their way. With the information? Enough. Good. Then we can continue to the next stage of the proceedings. And what about me? You will be protected, I can assure you. Master Yoda. We weren't expecting such a formal welcome, Master. A personal request of the Chancellor's, my escorting you was, Senator. Adventures, have you had, on Scipio, hmm? Have you met Rush Clovis? Met, we have, yes. Intrigued, we are, by your return to Coruscant. Much distrust is focused upon you. I understand, but I hope to right the wrongs that I have done. Delay, we must not. Excuse me if I find it hard to trust you, Clovis. You used to sit on this very Senate even as you funneled credits into the droid foundries of Count Dooku. I understand all of your trepidation, but there is corruption in the banks. And once we find this corruption? I believe the ones responsible should be ousted from control before the entire banking infrastructure collapses. Oh, and I suppose you're the man to do it. I only want the Banking Clan to be what it once was: a fair system of trade and commerce. I came here to root out the criminals and reveal the truth behind what is happening. Now, now. We are grateful for you bringing us this information, but what exactly can you prove? These files show that huge funds have been diverted out of the banks and into what I believe are private accounts. And the veracity of this information? I was the one who downloaded the files from the Muun's secure mainframe. I believe that what Clovis is saying is correct. Then, Senator Amidala, I would like you to spearhead this investigation. Work closely with Rush Clovis, and find and expose these secret accounts. Once we know exactly what we are dealing with, then we can decide how best to handle this situation. Why didn't you just say no? Say no? Why? I don't want you working with Clovis. You don't want me working with him? A serpent can shed its skin, but it is still a serpent. Well, you're just going to have to trust my judgment here. Like the last time, hmm? When you almost ended up dead? Or how about you just getting arrested, and it was me who had to bail you out? The Chancellor has asked me to do this, Anakin. But I'm asking you to say no. As your husband, I demand that you tell the Chancellor you are stepping down. Demand? We've been over this before. I'm not foolish enough to allow myself to be deceived twice, Anakin. My sole intentions are to defend the Republic. If you can't trust me Uh, excuse the interruption. Padm\u00e9, shall we begin? Yes, of course. General Skywalker. Darth Tyranus, it is time for you once again to recruit our friend Clovis. He appears to have lost his way. And how would you like me to do that? We're going to help him take over the Banking Clan. But first, you must entrap him so he has no one else to turn to. Of course, my lord. As you wish. I have been looking for you. Something wrong? You tell me. Not that I'm aware. Master Yoda feels that your judgments concerning Rush Clovis are clouded. Mm, I believe he can't be trusted. Yes, but there is more, isn't there? I sense a deep anger in you by my simply saying his name. He almost got Senator Amidala killed, and I would have been responsible. The Senator has risked her life many times. She's quite capable of taking care of herself. They had a relationship once. I simply feel she is vulnerable to her emotions. She is or you? What are you implying? Anakin, I understand to a degree what is going on. You've met Satine. You know I once harbored feelings for her. It's not that we're not allowed to have these feelings. It's natural. Senator Amidala and I are simply friends. And friends you must remain. As a Jedi, it is essential you make the right choice, Anakin, for the Order. I understand my responsibilities. Responsibilities that must be observed whatever relationship develops between Clovis and Senator Amidala. They have no relationship. It is simply business between them. Then we should have no problems, should we? The opera was wonderful, but I'm glad we can we can get down to business. If you look here, the Separatists haven't been repaying any interest on their loans. But still, the Banking Clan is promising to lend credits to the Republic, credits they simply don't have. But where have all the savings gone? Each of the files that you downloaded shows hundreds and hundreds of small withdrawals, small enough to remain undetected individually, but as a sum total, a devastating theft. Whoever is behind this is no fool. We need to find out who's benefiting. We're still lacking a critical piece of information. Whatever we find must remain between only you and I. This would be highly dangerous information should it get into the wrong hands. Of course. This reminds me, when we had three nights to prepare for the Senate hearing to rescue Bromlarch's planetary aqueduct system. And together, we saved a people from total drought and famine. I don't think either of us got any sleep that whole week, let alone ate anything. We're not as young as we used to be. Well, we're not that old either. You might be right. Perhaps we should eat something. So, Clovis, why have you gotten so involved with the Muuns? I believe in the banks. The system works. The Muuns aren't bad people. It's just a dishonest few who are destroying everything for their own gain. You know, you've never told me how you rose to such heights within the Banking Clan. It's not a happy story. My father was a personal attach\u00e9 to the household of one of the head Muun families. We were basically servants. I had no idea. As I grew up, the head of the family took a personal interest in my education. I was the same age as his children, and so we all studied together. When my parents and his wife were killed in a shuttle accident, he adopted me. How old were you? That must have been very hard. I was accepted as their child everywhere we went. I almost forgot where I was from, until I looked in the mirror. They sound like good people. They are. Most Muuns are. And they want this corruption ended more than I do. You should know my contacts within the Muun government run deep. I have many allies, should I need to call on them. I didn't appreciate how personal this was for you. Now maybe you will trust me. I'm here, aren't I? I want to thank you for everything you've done for me. I don't think I would have had the strength alone. Clovis, don't. It's that Jedi, isn't it? General Skywalker? We're friends, nothing more. Friends don't argue the way I saw you arguing today. You're confused. Isn't it forbidden for a Jedi to have romantic ties? He would be banished from the Order, would he not? There is nothing romantic between he and I. Then there is absolutely nothing to stop us from doing this. Clovis! Clovis, no. Get away from her! Anakin, no! Why don't you try fighting like a man without your Jedi tricks? Oh, it would be my pleasure. Both of you stop this! You don't have a say in this! I thought you said he didn't have feelings for you. I see you for what you truly are! Anakin: You're a serpent, a traitor! Please, stop this! No! Is that all you got? You should accept that the Senator has other interests than you. Ah, Skywalker, you fool. Stop it. Anakin, stop! What are you doing? I'm sorry. Senator Amidala, is everything okay in there? No. Come in immediately. What has happened here? There was an attack. It was my good fortune to have General Skywalker here. They escaped in a speeder over the balcony. Is that what happened, sir? If that's what the man says. A medic droid is on its way. Please, help Clovis into the bedroom. - Padm\u00e9, I'm - Stay away from me. How is he? Nothing that won't heal. I'm so sorry, Padm\u00e9. I don't know what came over me. What's done is done. It's just, when I saw you about to kiss him And I regret that, but it was not what you thought. And you must know, I don't care for Clovis. Don't you? I've told you why I'm doing this, but still, you refuse to accept it. You could have killed him, Anakin. I know. This marriage is not a marriage, Anakin, if there isn't any trust. We said at the beginning that this could be a terrible mistake. What exactly are you saying? That other people who are married have everything that we don't, everything that we won't. We live in secret, Anakin. Like it or not, our relationship is built on lies and deception. No relationship can survive that. I know I went too far. It's just It's just something inside me snapped. I don't know who's in there sometimes. I just know that I'm not happy anymore. I don't feel safe. But, Padm\u00e9 I think it's best if we don't see each other anymore, at least not for a while. I'm sorry, Anakin. I'm I'm sorry too. Everything all right, Senator? No. Nothing appears to be broken, but more importantly, someone wants to speak with you. What are you talking about? I am a servant of Count Dooku. Hello, Clovis. What do you want, Dooku? It appears we have a mutual problem that I would like to fix. I know the Separatists have not been repaying their loans to the banks. Now, why would we support corruption? You expect me to believe that Lesser and his associates have no ties with you? They've allowed you to borrow credits and not pay any interest. What you say is correct, but that information, if made public, will only bring war to Scipio, and the banks will fall. Nobody wants that. So in the interests of all, I suggest we come to some arrangement. What are you saying? That the banks need new management, and that it could be you. That I would like help If I didn't know better, I'd say you were afraid. I prefer the term \"careful.\" These are delicate matters. We need funds, just as the Republic does to pay for this war. I can give you the location of the secret accounts you are searching for so you can plead your case to the Senate. And you won't stand in my way? We'll even start paying the interest on our loans to show the Republic our full endorsement. What do you get out of this? Stability in unstable times. The location of the accounts are on this disc. Now, where were we? The Muun government has seized the accounts and arrested the heads of the Banking Clan. We are indebted to Rush Clovis for his service to our people. Well, I have done only what I thought was right. Considering the information, it appears that the Separatist government has agreed to allow you to be the new head of the banks. And the Republic? I can only give you my endorsement. Now all that stands in your way is the Senate. Order. Order! Good luck. Thank you. Rush Clovis will now address the Senate. Traitor! Clovis? I come to you today with irrefutable evidence that the heads of the Banking Clan have been stealing funds, and have virtually bankrupted the system. I know the Muuns to be a good and honest people, and that it is the actions of only these unscrupulous few who are responsible. I humbly ask you for your nomination in taking over the banks. What can you do? I will restore order and return the banks back to secure and mutual negotiations and transactions. How can we trust you? I vow to be impartial and show no favor to either side in this war. But you have colluded with the Separatists. It is the Separatist ties to Rush Clovis that has allowed them to accept this nomination. He also has the full support of the Muun people. And what of the Chancellor? I believe that in these dangerous times, the bank must be protected at all costs and that a man who has no allegiance to either side, and the support of the Muun people, is our best hope. Then we shall put it to a vote. A resounding majority in support of the nomination. My boy, I can tell this has been a difficult time. I've known you too long not to see something is troubling you. Your Excellency, forgive me, but you have made a mistake by trusting Clovis. Have I? Rest assured, my public endorsement of Clovis is not the same as my private confidence in him. Then what exactly is going on here? We will watch him closely. I don't dispute your distrust of him. I think there is something we haven't unearthed yet, and I would very much like for it to surface. But people have been hurt could be hurt in the process. Let us make sure that doesn't happen. Shall we?   \n                "}, "Slaves of the Republic": {"episode": "s04e12", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tKidnapped! During a Separatist invasion of the planet Kiros, thousands of peaceful colonists were abducted by Zygerrian slavers. Determined to find the missing colonists, the Jedi travel to Zygerria, home to the galaxy's most notorious slave empire. It looks like Zygerria is a popular place these days. Hmm. Whatever is happening is attracting plenty of high class scum. Let's just hope the information our spies gave us about the Queen is accurate. Remember, I'll keep her occupied while you locate the missing people of Kiros. How do you plan on keeping the Queen occupied? - With my magnetic charm, of course. - Oh, yes, of course. Hold on to this, will you, buddy? Remind me why I'm the one playing the part of the slave? I tried it once, I wasn't any good at it. Besides, the role of master comes easily to me. Really? Well, this time try to be convincing at it. Ugh! How can a civilization this advanced still practice slavery? It makes them wealthy and powerful at the expense of others. Before the Hutts bought my mother, she was sold in a market just like this. Get up, you useless skug. Master, the bonds, they are too heavy. Tell it to my whip. You don't want to do that. You dare touch me! Excuse my slave, friend. She is freshly caught. Hmm. What have we here? You wear Zygerrian armor, but you are not one of us. Who are you? I've come for an audience with the Queen. Then you have an invitation? We can't just let anyone in to speak with Her Majesty. No invitation, but I do bring news, news the Queen will be eager to hear. I doubt that, you're nothing more than a brigand. I wouldn't say that, especially when the Queen learns you prevented her from hearing the news about Bruno Denturri. Halt! Cease all hostilities. This man is to be escorted to the palace, by order of the Queen. Make certain all preparations are complete for this evening. And fetch refreshments. My Queen, I present Lars Quell. Hmm. So, you are the man who claims to be acquainted with Bruno Denturri? Yes, Your Highness. However, when I spoke with him he failed to describe your beauty. Really? And did Bruno speak of my intense hatred of him? Or did that escape his memory as well? He needed not speak of it, Your Majesty. In fact, Bruno Denturri will not be speaking ever again. What do you mean? Bruno Denturri is dead by my hand. Here is a slave from his palace, compensation for my efforts. Unhand me, brigand! You impress me, Lars Quell. She is quite a prize. And to have defeated Bruno Denturri in combat, you must be quite the warrior. Hmm. Mmm-hmm. The slave is certainly of fine stock, Bruno always knew how to choose a beautiful female. Don't you dare touch me! Though she will have to be processed. Her demeanor leaves much to be desired. What is your price for her? With respect, how can I price the beauty of this slave, when I look upon the magnificence of Your Highness, whose beauty would make the brightest star seem dull by comparison. Lars Quell, you flatter me. No, Your Majesty, however Lars, stop it. Stop it! You are a bold one, aren't you? My reputation precedes me then. Perhaps we can find a way to put a price on your slave. Come, walk with me. Sir, take a look at this. Stand watch, I'll take a closer look. Governor Roshti? No! No! Governor, I'm a friend, a Jedi, here to help. - Where are your people? - They're - Sir, did you find out where the others are? - Not yet. We've got to get him out of here. You there, what are you doing with that slave? Slavery is the natural order of things. The weak deserve nothing more than to kneel before the strong, bound to our service. I will need men with your talents to spread our ways across the galaxy. Let me go! You dare raise a hand against your master. Clearly you require further processing. No! I won't go back there. Wait! Stop! Such a waste. But perhaps she was more trouble than she's worth. But you, Lars, you are proving quite resourceful. Very well, I will pay your price for this slave girl. It seems I am in need of a new servant. She is my gift to you, Your Highness. You are a man of many surprises. It pleases me. I wish you to be my guest at the slave auction, and to sit at my side. Well - Who is he? - He hasn't talked, but I'll loosen his tongue. Why would a slaver try to rescue a slave from the palace? It's suicide. Wait. I know you from the hologram. I never forget a Jedi. Your Highness, Zygerrians, and guests from a thousand worlds, our auction begins with slaves of unmatched quality and impossible quantity. I give you Togruta from the Kiros System! Oh, no. This handsome sample represents a lot of numbering, no less than 50,000 beings. Note the compliance. Virtually untrained in combat. There will be no rebellion from these slaves. So where do you keep 50,000 slaves, like the people of Kiros? Your Majesty, I have urgent news. All will be revealed in time. Before we begin the auction, I would welcome a most special guest, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi knight! Down with the Jedi! The Jedi are not so tough. My friends, my good friends, do not fear the Jedi. They are no different from others we have forced into submission, for they have forsaken their ideals to serve a corrupt Senate. Every Jedi has become a slave to the Republic. The Jedi Order is weak, and we will help break it. Teach the Jedi his place. Whip the Jedi! Whip the Jedi! Whip the Jedi! Whip the Jedi! Looks like I have to rescue you again, old man. I knew you'd have a backup plan. Prove to me you are a slaver. Swing that whip, or die beside him. Those are some lousy options. You leave me no choice, Highness. Guards, subdue them! Ahsoka, the Queen! Looks like your slave empire is finished, again. Get that thing out of my face, you little skug! Such determination. You destroyed my auction and frightened my customers. Count Dooku and half my kingdom are demanding your death. You should have listened to them. My friends, where are they? Continue to misbehave and they die. A most curious Jedi who cares more about his friends than his own mission. Hero. General. And now my servant. I will not serve you. Your heart is not in your words. You will stand beside me, a testament to my power. Here, my bodyguard will need a weapon. And you need not worry about your friends, they will be quite safe. The Queen has promised once the other Jedi is tamed, you will be mine, little skug. Whoa! You better hope that doesn't happen. My people, we have found them. Keep moving, skug. General Kenobi, you are the first Jedi I have entertained at our educational center. Few possess a Jedi's resolve, and it is strength of will that is my greatest enemy. Now that I have your attention, Jedi, be aware that it will not be you who suffers should you defy me. You were once a slave, weren't you? What makes you think I was a slave? The noble selflessness in your eyes. Your commitment to the service of something greater than yourself. Your Jedi, the grand Republic, even your friends. I don't see commitment as slavery. Oh, it is when it comes at the cost of yourself. What you could be! With you willingly beside me, there is nothing we could not accomplish. We are nothing. You have all the power. What if I freed your friends? Would you promise to stay? Commit to serving me? If a Jedi as noble as you gave his word, I think you might keep it. I don't trust you. Have I been anything but honest? I have no reason to lie. I am who I am. It is you, you, who are the complicated one. Now, Master Skywalker, the future of your friends lays in your hands. If they are to live as slaves, it will be you who keeps them that way.   \n                "}, "Pursuit of Peace": {"episode": "s03e11", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tStar Wars: The Clone Wars Truth can strike down the spectre of fear. Peace shattered. Once-promising negotiations between the Republic and the separatists are now in shambles following a droid suicide bombing on the capitol city-planet of Coruscant. As fear and anger prevail, the senate overwhelmingly passes a bill to deregulate the banks, opening the gateway to additional troops and an increase in fighting. Members of the senate, please, please How dare they? They attack, and now they want peace? Chancellor Palpatine, may I remind the senators that the peace proposal was made prior to their assault. That only highlights its insincerity. Chancellor Palpatine, in light of this unprovoked attack on Coruscant and the vulnerabilities it raises, I propose the Republic purchase an additional 5 million clone troopers. The Republic is already operating in deep debt. How do you propose we pay for these additional troops? My people are drafting an emergency appropriations bill - That would raise funds - From the banking clan? Yes, of course. Do you have an alternate means of paying? One alternative might be to stop the war, not escalate it. - Traitor! - Traitor! No! You cannot believe her. Whoever attacked the power grid wants us to continue to fight. It's a calculated attempt to destroy the peace process. Not everyone in the confederacy wants this. I know this for a fact. You have separatists friends, senator? Whose side are you on? What? We will not stand for this. Please, the young senator from Naboo makes a point. There is no need to We have just received a message from our opponent, Count Dooku. Your Republic forces have carried out a barbaric attack on our people, and among the deaths was the very sponsor of the peace accord, senator Miina Bonteri. What? No. With her needless death, I must formally withdraw the proposal for peace offered by our senate. We must not show weakness. Thank you, Teckla. Yes, my lady. I can't believe it. I just can't believe the Republic would target senator Bonteri. She was the only one willing to stand up for peace. You shouldn't believe it. The Republic spies are reporting that senator Bonteri was murdered by Dooku's thugs. That message to the senate was a ploy to disguise his true actions. I am so sorry, Padme. If your friend met with a violent end because of her politics, let's make sure her courageous effort wasn't in vain. What can we do? For one, defeat this bill. Can we really win this war with the troops that we have? Let's hope we don't have to. I'll start lining up support, but I'll need ammunition. We can't afford ammunition, remember? I joke. Go to the banking clan and see how much interest they're going to charge for the loan. The more I know about what the exact cost of this bill will be, the better I can make my case to defeat it. Right, let's go, uncle. You know these banking clan people. Plus, you owe me for telling such a bad joke. Tee ta poo shan aka. We will lend the Republic at our standard interest rate of - What? - 25%. That's outright theft. Your previous arrangement with the Republic was 10%. Please, please, that was before deregulation. The same rules don't apply, my dear. The separatists don't seem to mind a rate hike. In fact, they just secured a loan to fund an additional They would wipe us out. You would let Dooku do that? You live on Coruscant too. We have no stake in this war, senator. You know that. War is Distasteful to all of us. That's a lot of credits. The interest alone could completely bankrupt the Republic. As it is, social services have suffered because of this war, education, infrastructure, health care. If we go deeper into debt, the basic needs of our people will evaporate. - This is good. - \u00ddt is? Clearly taking out a loan on such obscene terms would essentially destroy the Republic, regardless of the outcome of the war. We only need to sway another handful of senators, as long as they don't buckle to the threats. What threats? Some members have received messages, warning them not to vote against the bill. Considering what's happened to your friend Bonteri, they're frightened. A mandatory blackout is in progress. All citizens report to the designated safe area. A mandatory blackout is in progress. All citizens report to the designated safe area. Ugh! No! No! Ugh! Can't you all see this bill is short-sighted? Millions of clones won't win this war. The only winner will be the banking clan. They want to pass this bill so badly, they're using scare tactics to sway votes. I am not intimidated, senator Amidala. Then why are you voting for additional troops? I happen to believe more clones are precisely what we need, and my caucus agrees with me. I'm sorry. Uncle ono, what happened? Two thugs jumped me, but I am fine. This is outrageous. Something has to be done. Padme, this will not change my mind. No matter what, I will vote against the bill. a\u0099\u00aa a\u0099\u00aa I see senator Amidala hasn't given up her crusade. She doesn't have the votes, my lord. Ha-ha-ha. We've taken care of 20 senators. Ha. It may be time to send her a message as well. You want us to have a talk with her? No. I think something special is called for in senator Amidala's case. We're all ears, boss. Take her out of the game. a\u0099\u00aa a\u0099\u00aa As long as senators are being threatened and attacked, I'm afraid we don't stand a chance. Intimidation won't work on everyone. Senator Farr is proof of that. Even so, we're still at least six votes short of a majority, and you saw how effective my plea was today. Some minds can't be altered no matter what they hear. From my experience, it depends a great deal on who's sending the message. And what are you thinking? Bail, you're the finest public speaker I know. If anyone can convince the senate that voting for this bill will bankrupt the Republic both financially and spiritually, it's you. it's you. It will be dangerous. I urge you to speak before the full senate. I'll need some time to prepare. Good. In the meantime, I'll pay another visit to those still undecided. I'll be parked just over there, my lady. Thank you. This way, uncle. What does ideology matter at this point? Is it worth being beaten to death? Look at what they did to you. These wounds will heal, but what about the millions who are dying in this war? Who? The clones? We created them for just that purpose. They are people. The people I care about are my constituents, the ones who put me in office. And when was the last time you ever spoke to your people? Probably the same time you did, or you, senator. Senator Christo, please, is there anything we can do to get you to change your mind? Where does senator Organa stand on all this? Why isn't he here? Senator Organa is preparing to speak before the full senate. Senator Organa? Hmm, I'll listen to what he has to say. So you are open to voting with us? I said I'll listen to what he has to say. Well, it's better than a no, and I'm sure when Christo and the others hear what bail has to say, they will vote our way. Can I give you a ride? My driver's only a block away. I think I'd like to walk. - But, Padme - Don't worry, uncle Ono, I can take care of myself. Plus, I can use the fresh air. Just be careful. Oh, yeah Put your hands up. Arrest these bounty hunters. We'll take care of this, miss. Drop your weapons and come with us quietly. Quietly? Where's my driver? Where's my Hey, my ride! My eyes! Land the vehicle. That is a stolen vehicle. Those bounty hunters were trying to kill me. I am a senator. I demand that you arrest them. Get your hands in the air. Ouch. Don't you think you should report this to the jedi council? There's nothing they can do. I know who did it. They were bounty hunters, paid to stop me from voting against the troop increase. What has happened to democracy? And why doesn't anyone seem to care? You do. Forgive me, my lady. Um, you're not like most politicians. If only that were enough, Teckla. Well, you actually talk to the people, people like me. - Good night, my lady. - Teckla, tell me, how is your family? They are fine. How is the war affecting them? Well, it hasn't been easy, and it's only getting worse. How? Please, tell me. Tell me how it's geting worse. You're not gonna get away like your lady friend, senator. Senator. Medic! Oh, Padme. - What is it? - You must come quickly. You need to see something. Bail, what happened? - Padme - Senator, you need to lie down. My speech, my speech The senate is expecting me. Is there any way? I'm sorry. He's in no condition to even stand. We need to take him to the hospital. Of course. Take him at once. The speech Padme, you must address the senate. Only you can do this. Perhaps we should get the vote started. I told senator Organa I'd allow him to speak. We have waited long enough. I agree with senator Orn free Taa. Let's vote. You must give the speech in his place. But they're expecting to hear from the great bail Organa. He carries a certain weight. He's seen as a voice of reason. You are very respected. As a partisan. I've been against this bill from day one. If they didn't listen to me before, why would they listen now? Because you do listen. You understand what the people are going through. Please. Your people are waiting for you. Let us now vote on senator Burtoni's bill to fund The opposition to this bill must be allowed to speak first. Unfortunately, senator Organa is nowhere to be found. I will speak on his behalf. Senator Amidala will be permitted to speak. Teckla Minnau. What did she say? Teckla is one of my aides. Like so many of the people that we tell ourselves we're here to serve, Teckla lives in a district that rarely has electricity and running water as a result of the war. Her children can now only bathe every two weeks, and they have no light in which to read or study at night. The Republic has always funded these basic services, but now, there are those who would divert the money to the war with no thought for what the people need to survive. If not for people like Teckla and her children, who are we fighting for? My people, your people, all of our people. This war is meant to save them from suffering, not increase it. I support our brave soldiers, whether they come from the clone factories or from any of the thousands of systems loyal to the Republic, but if we continue to impoverish our people, it is not on the battlefield where Dooku will defeat us, but in our own homes. Therefore, it is our duty and our responsibility to preserve the lives of those around us by defeating this bill. Well done, Padme. Isn't it remarkable, that one can have all the power in the galaxy, and yet the words of a single senator, can sway the thoughts of millions? What do you plan to do about this? For now, we must adhere to the principles of our democracy. We must let the wheels of the senate turn.   \n                "}, "Dooku Captured": {"episode": "s01e11", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe.Clone.Wars SEasone 1 Episode 11 Manhunt! After a long and perilous search, the Jedi finally track down separatist leader count Dooku. During a heroic attempt to capture the count, Anakin Skywalker has gone missing. Having lost contact with Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi heads toward his friend's last known location, a lone separatist frigate in the far reaches of the outer rim. Don't bother to get up. You're not the prisoner I'm looking for. Oh, it's you. This is how you thank me for rescuing you, pounce on me from the ceiling? Kind of difficult without a Lightsaber. Thanks. Did you manage to locate Dooku before landing in jail? Well, I know he's on board. Might have been able to do something about it if I'd had my weapon. It was important for you to arrive without it - so your capture would be convincing. - Oh, they were convinced, all right. But how come I'm the one getting caught all the time? It doesn't look good. When you're a Jedi master, you can make the plan. That's just it. How can I become a Jedi master if I'm always getting caught? At least you're a master at getting caught. Very funny. Surprise, surprise. If it isn't count Dooku. Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought I sensed an unpleasant disturbance in the force. I see you've freed young Skywalker. Where might he be if you weren't always around to rescue him? Sir, there's a Jedi cruiser attacking. Let's try not to blow up the ship before they get off this time. Your ship is surrounded, count. Republic troops are boarding as we speak. Jedi fools. I should have seen that coming. - What are you doing? - Following him. Not that way. We need to cut him off. You cut him off. I'll follow him and meet you at the hangar. Why do I even try? Oh, great. - Your ship is ready, sir. - Good. - I thought you were following Dooku. - I was. I followed him here. Hang on. Ahsoka, Dooku managed to escape. We're in pursuit, but we could use reinforcements. Follow us in what ships you can round up. We'll get there as soon as we can. That was easy. Lucky for you, I'm an excellent shot. Well, now those fighters are attacking. I'm on it. He's getting too close. Lucky for you, I'm an excellent pilot. For all your expertise, this is not a very smooth landing. And if you'd hit that second fighter, we wouldn't be in this mess. I've had better landings. Dooku. What's this, a homing beacon? Which means the distinguished count is waiting for help. - So he can't be far off. - His engine is damaged. - He's not going anywhere. - Not without a homing beacon. There. Caves are a good start. Strange. You sense it too. Many life forms in there. And Dooku's one of them. Let's try to get him before something else does. What's that? Run ! You won't be needing this anymore, Skywalker. Well, well. What do we have here? Who are you? More importantly, my friend, who are you? Master! Obi-Wan, can you hear me? Master! Anakin, when I tell you to run, run. Master! You're alive. And where's your lightsaber? It got knocked out of my hand. - By a rock? - Yeah, by a rock. - It's got to be here somewhere. - That is a feeble excuse. You know what would be helpful? A little light. Certainly. Silly thing. It was just working a minute ago. You don't suppose it was hit by a rock, do you? This should be interesting. Your solar sailor is very beautiful. It's a pretty rare ship, very expensive. What are you doing all the way out here? I sustained some damage in an asteroid storm and had to make a landing. Feel free to help yourself to it. If you need transport, the nearest planet is Florrum. It's six parsecs away. Is it civilized? That depends on your definition of civilized. But you would certainly be more comfortable there than here. Vanqor is no place to be after dark. Perhaps I shall take you up on your offer. Very good. Now all that's left to do is settle my fee. Fee? Just a little something to cover my expenses. It shouldn't be a problem for someone so obviously wealthy as yourself. I'd be happy to compensate you for your services. That's it, boys! We are heading home. Jump in anytime! Oh, you're doing fine. She seems to like you. Yeah, lucky me! This isn't as much fun as it looks. I thought gundarks were only found on Vanqor. Then this system must be Vanqor. - So that would make this one - The mother of all gundarks. Precisely. Are you gonna help me? Well, you took your time. It's a pity. I was just starting to sense a connection. Should I leave you two alone, or would you prefer to find a way out of this hole before she wakes up? Welcome to Florrum. Lose your flashy sword? Are these what you were looking for, Jedi? I am more powerful than any Jedi. Know that you are dealing with a sith lord. You're still outnumbered. The leader of the clanker army and a sith lord, no less. Someone is sure to pay a pretty price for you. Provide me with the proper means of communications. I will arrange for any ransom to be paid. And you will arrange for your armies to crush us as well. You don't survive in the outer rim by being stupid. If the separatists will pay to get you back, chances are, the republic will offer even more. - Sounds like another gundark. - It's too far away to worry about. It won't stay far away. New problem. That's not good. It's just gas. Probably toxic gas. That's good. Maybe it'll kill your gundark. - And maybe it will kill us. - Come on. Let's get out of here. This isn't gonna work. - I can't breathe. - As always, I'm open to sugges Come on, Obi-Wan. Don't give up now. - What was that? - I have no idea. Master! Looks like I got here just in time. What do you mean, just in time? - You were in very big trouble. - Trouble? We were simply searching for Count Dooku. We had the situation well under control, my little Padawan. I see. So which part of the situation did you have under control: the blocked entrance, the poison gas, or that gundark behind you? Gundark? You mean the one that's too far away to worry about? Block the entrance. There's still Dooku to deal with. You let him get away? No, not get away exactly. Just Chime in anytime. Oh, no. I'm enjoying this far too much. If you want the Sith Lord, it will cost you a million credits. The payment will be in spice delivered in an unarmed diplomatic ship. We will need proof he's alive before agreeing to your terms. Let me present your fearless Sith Lord. I'm afraid he's too embarrassed to speak. A hologram can be faked. You want proof? This is his lightsaber. Belongs to Dooku, that lightsaber does. This scum having possession of Dooku's lightsaber proves nothing. If you refuse, I am sure the Separatist council will be more than willing to meet my price. We may never have a better chance to capture Count Dooku. We would like to send two Jedi to confirm you have Count Dooku before delivering the ransom. Send your Jedi, but they must be unarmed. - Impossible. - They will be safe. We have no interest in getting involved in your war. We've reestablished contact with Kenobi and Skywalker. They're in a system close to Florrum. And most eager to find Dooku, they are. His only stipulation is that you arrive unarmed. Unarmed? We know very little about these pirates. We may be walking blind into what could very well be a hostile situation. We can't let Dooku slip through our fingers again. Report back as soon as you arrive. This should be fun. Follow me. Gentlemen. Can I offer you something to drink? No, thank you. Congratulations on your capture of Count Dooku. - Very impressive. - Yes, it was. Even a Sith Lord is no match for my warriors. He put up quite a fight: blasters, cannons, that glowy thing. - You mean a lightsaber? - That's it. And I don't need to tell you, those things can do some damage. Carved up some of my best men pretty good before I could get the jump on him. And how exactly did you get the jump on him? With this? We have no interest in disagreeing with you. All we want is to confirm you are holding Dooku, and we'll go. I will arrange a meeting. Look how the mighty Sith Lord has fallen. This place suits you, Count. It wasn't so long ago that you yourself were in similar surroundings on my ship. Yeah, but now I'm free, and you're not. I'm confident the situation will rectify itself soon. Soon you'll be brought to trial by the Senate and most likely spend a very long time in a cell just like this one. And that's if you're lucky. My naive young Jedi. You must be overly optimistic if you think these Weequayans plan to let you leave this planet. They're planet-hopping thieves looking for a quick score. They have no interest in picking a fight with Jedi. They are devious and deceitful and most importantly, stupid. It's a wonder you don't get along with them, Dooku. You have so much in common. You underestimate them at your own peril, Kenobi. I don't know about you, but I could use some rest. Remember, Anakin, this could still be a trap. You're not worried about Dooku, are you? No, I'm worried about these pirates. Jedi! Now that you're business is completed, we invite you to join us in the grand hall for a banquet. And a true Weequay banquet is not to be missed. No question they have Dooku. Send the ransom. He's being securely held? - And very cranky about it. - Good. Senator Kharrus and Representative Binks will be dispatched immediately. Now, can I persuade you to join us for a drink? It's a tradition, in the name of friendship. All right, but nothing too strong. - He's flying. - Bring our guests some refreshments. To a successful transaction. To powerful pirates and new friends of the Republic. Enjoy your evening, gentlemen. - I still don't get it. - Get what? How a bunch of drunken pirates managed to catch Dooku when we couldn't. Maybe there's a lesson to be learned here. - I still don't get it. - It's to remind us to be humble and never too proud to accept a gift when it comes our way. Well, to unexpected gifts, then. Hear. Hear. The negociations were short. Weequayan pirates have captured Anakin and I and our cellmate is my least favorite Sith Lord, Count Dooku. All we have to do now, is break out with Dooku and escape without dying. Unfortunately, it seems our only help is Jar Jar. This is not going as planned.   \n                "}, "Crisis At The Heart": {"episode": "s06e07", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t6x07 - \"Crisis at the Heart\"  Corruption discovered at the core of the Banking Clan! Reunited, Rush Clovis and Senator Amidala discover the full extent of the deception. Anakin Skywalker is sent to the rescue! He refuses to trust Clovis and asks Padm\u00e9 not to work with him. Determined to save the banks, she refuses her husband's request, throwing their relationship into turmoil. Voted for by both the Separatists and the Republic, Rush Clovis is elected new leader of the Galactic Banking Clan. Now, all attention is focused on Scipio as the important transfer of power begins. Welcome back to Scipio, Rush Clovis. Our Separatist government has great hopes for you. Thank you, Senator. Only you and Senator Amidala will be allowed to monitor the exchange proceedings. No forces on either side will be allowed into the Neutral Zone. Senator Amidala, we will be right here if you should need us. Thank you, Commander. It is with great disappointment that I implement the following verdict. By decree of the Muun people, the five representatives standing before me are found guilty of embezzlement. They shall be imprisoned forthwith, and control of the banks shall transfer immediately to Rush Clovis under the guidance of the Muun government. We are grateful to you, Clovis, for everything you have done for the Muun people. To have lost the banks would have been an historic disaster. I would like you to know I have no interest in controlling the banks. I am simply here to reestablish order. Do you think our friend is up to the task? There are few men I have met in my career who are more dedicated to a cause than Clovis. Once he decides what he is fighting for, little will stop him from achieving it. Let us hope you are right for all our sakes. Ah, Clovis. How are you liking your new office? I must say, you look very comfortable behind that desk. Count Dooku, what do I owe the pleasure? Come, come, my boy. You don't think I'd let such an important day pass without wishing you the best of luck. Thank you, but luck has nothing to do with it. The transfer has occurred without a hitch. Well, of course it has. The Separatists are fully behind your appointment. After all, aren't we the ones who put you there? For your support, I am grateful, but I now must lead without allegiance towards either side. Is that so? Quite the idealist you have become in so short a time. What do you want, Dooku? To collect on my investment. How do you think the Republic would like to know that it was I who supplied Rush Clovis with all the information he needed to topple the leaders of the bank? I will tell them myself. Oh, but you can't. I put you in power. You belong to me, and if you want to stay in control, you will do as I say. The banks will remain unbiased. Then I'm afraid the Separatists will be unable to pay the interest on our loans. But the banks will collapse, and then Not if you raise interest rates on the Republic. What? You know I can't do that. Oh, but you can, and you will, or everything that you fought so hard for will be destroyed. By the new order of the Traxus Division and in an attempt to stabilize the banks, it is essential that interest rates on loans to the Republic be raised immediately. What? But you can't do that! Clovis. Clovis! What are you doing? This is an outrage! We warned you this would happen! And what of the Separatists? From the little information Senator Amidala has been able to establish, there will be no raise on their current loan. I knew from the beginning that Clovis would do this. Hmm, correct you might have been about Clovis. It's incredibly foolish for to make a move like this so early. He will turn the whole Republic against him. Not clear to us are his objectives. Want this he might. Something's wrong. This doesn't make sense. I would like to call for restraint and allow us time to analyze the situation. You may begin your attack. It is time to make Rush Clovis look like a powerful Separatist. Right away, sir. It looks like an invasion fleet, sir. We're caught out here in the open. Get the men off this landing pad and beyond the city gates! Senator Amidala, come in, please. What is it, Commander Thorn? We're under attack by the Separatist garrison. Looks to be a full invasion. Invasion? We can't get to you. I suggest you get to a ship as soon as you can. boom! Ahh! Let's move! Hurry! Ah! For the Republic! Ah! Our garrison has been attacked by the Separatists, and it appears they are staging an invasion of Scipio. An invasion? What do they hope to achieve? With this news, the Senate will vote immediately to attack Scipio. It appears war has already come to Scipio. I want you off that planet immediately. I can't. Surely you can get to a ship. General Skywalker, I'm afraid I'm trapped. Let me go! Invoke an emergency meeting of the Senate. There is no time to lose. I feel it is only right that you should handle this matter, my boy. A lot will be entrusted to you. Don't touch me! What have you done to her? Clovis, what is going on? I didn't want this, Padm\u00e9. Why don't you tell her what you did want and how you got it. Dooku. Padm\u00e9, this is not what it seems. Hasn't she joined our cause? Clovis here told me how instrumental you were in getting him to power. If I had known Either you are with us or you are against us. Arrest her! We can't do this, Dooku. The Separatist Senate will never approve. Hey! No. No. No! No! Are you insane? This was not part of the deal. What deal? What have you done here, Clovis? He's given us the banks. Gone are our debts, and gone is any credit for the Republic. All of your idealism was just a front. There was nothing I could do. Everyone has their price, my dear. It is with grave news I come before you. Count Dooku and his Separatist betrayers have manipulated us, my friends. The war must go to Scipio! Clovis has been their puppet of deceit as the Separatists are currently invading Scipio. We must stop them and secure the planet! We have handed the entire economic system over to Count Dooku. We are doomed! Invade! As Supreme Chancellor, I must abide by the consensus of the Senate. We shall commence a mercy mission to Scipio to be led by General Anakin Skywalker. The banks will be secured at all costs, and the Republic will not crumble! Victory! We will take victory. War on Scipio! Great emotions you will find on Scipio, will you not? I am worried for Senator Amidala. I'm afraid we may be too late. Correct you were about Clovis, but let go of your selfishness you must if you are to see clearly. Not all is as it seems. I understand, Master. Lord Tyranus, the Republic fleet will be arriving shortly. Very good, my lord. Clovis has blindly played his part. It now appears he coordinated the entire Separatist takeover. And because of this treachery, the banks will be firmly placed under the control of the Supreme Chancellor. Why are you doing this? You wouldn't understand. I had to strike a deal with Dooku, but don't worry. I am the one in control. As soon as things have settled down, I can get rid of him, and I'll control it all again. Listen to yourself. The Republic is sending its armada to take back the banks. You've brought war right where there cannot be war. Your actions have destroyed the banks once and for all! Rex, have you gotten a fix on Senator Amidala's position? We'll have a better lock once we get near the city, but initial scans suggest she's still alive, sir. Good. Hawk, we're gonna need air support once we're on the ground. You'll have it, General. Me and the boys are ready to fly. My Lord, we have fully engaged Republic forces, but we are suffering heavy losses. We have accomplished what we came here for. It is time to withdraw. But sir, our forces are still engaged in battle on the planet. Leave them. As you wish, Count Dooku. Sir, a Republic attack fleet has just entered orbit and is approaching the city. Get me Count Dooku. It appears Count Dooku has left the planet's surface. What? And the Separatist forces are in full retreat. We are alone. Rex, hold the droid forces here. I'm gonna push on and get Padm\u00e9. Copy that. Such plans I had. You know, I've spent so much of my life misunderstood. What will they say about me now? What will I have left behind? Clovis, you have to turn yourself in. It's over, Clovis. Stay away from me! I didn't do anything wrong! You have to believe me! You don't want to do this. You don't understand. You've all been deceived. Yeah, by you. No! By Dooku. I'm not the villain here. Tell him, Padm\u00e9. Let me go, Clovis. I can't hold both of you. Let me go. No, Anakin, don't. Try and climb. I am! I'm losing you! I'm sorry, Padm\u00e9. No. It's okay. You're okay. I'm sorry, Anakin. I'm sorry. It's over now. It's all over now. It is clear to the Banking Clan it was Rush Clovis who was behind the corruption that almost caused our collapse. In hope of a better tomorrow, we cede control of the banks to the office of the Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. It is with great humility that I take on this immense responsibility. Rest assured, when the Clone Wars end, I shall reinstate the banks as we once knew them, but during these treacherous times, we cannot in good conscience allow our money to fall under the manipulations of a madman like Count Dooku or Separatist control again. May there be prosperity and stability in all our Republic lands. May our people be free and safe. Long live the banks! Long live the banks! Long live the banks! Long live the banks! Long live the banks! Long live the banks! Long live the banks! Long live the banks! Long live the banks!   \n                "}, "Shadow Warrior": {"episode": "s04e04", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tAs war continues to fracture the galaxy, planets become pawns in a dangerous chess game.

Rumors that the Gungans plan to aid the Separatists in an attack on Theed force senator Padm\u00c3\u00a9 Amidala home, accompanied by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. Jar Jar, do you read me? It's Anakin. We need you to meet us on the surface of Lake Paonga immediately. Okie day, mui palo. There's bombad trouble down here. We know. That's why we need to talk to you. Oh, boy. Mesa must stop zipping to the surface. Ears go boomba some day. What's going on, Jar Jar? We're hearing disturbing rumors. Is Boss Lyonie calling for a march on Theed? Oh, yes, my lady. He give mui fiery speeches, blaming Naboo for everything. Mesa say it couldn't be true. Of course, it's not. We need to talk to him, Jar Jar. For centuries the Nabooians have treated you like second-class citizens. No more! There's moments in history when change is necessary. Are you going to take what is rightfully ours? This mui mui bad. Don't worry, General, mesa friends can help. Mesa hope so, Jar Jar. Be quick. Young Senator Amidala, if you here to talk mesa out of marching on Theed, you wasting time. With all due respect, your course of action is based on lies. You must make your warriors stand down. Mesa different now! Mesa enlightened! See? Acting loconut. He seems possessed, if you ask me. Or under someone's influence. Stop whispering and go, be gone. The necklace! What's happening? Binks? Who are they? Who are we? Boss Lyonie, don't you remember anything? Who gave you this necklace, Your Majesty? Minister Rish Loo, he given it to me. He telling me it make me bombad leader, very powerful. They say Rish Loo know ancient Gungan mystical power. Mind over matter. But he only use it for good. Until now, you mean. Events, they're proceeding as planned, Count. Very good. Mesa able to persuade the officers to allowing the Separatist army easy access into Naboo. You're doing the right thing for your people, Minister Loo. Let mesa go in alone. We'll be right outside. And mesa counsel will be rewarded in yousa new order? You will be most influential. Someone is coming. Why it's Boss Lyonie! What do mesa owe the pleasure? You tricked me, Rish Loo. - Mesa don't - You used magical powers to manipulate mesa head-thoughts. Mesa never attack the surface-dwelling brothers and sisters unless you clouded mesa head. You not thinking clearly, bombad leader. Where's the necklace mesa given you? It's destroyed. You not control me no more. You mistaken, king fool. Something's wrong, we better get up there. Boss Lyonie, don't listen to him! You get them! - Check on Boss Lyonie. - Ani! This is mui upsetting, my lady. I know, Jar Jar. How is he? The bandages have stopped the bleeding, but he's unconscious. The Gungans are still gathered and poised to march on Theed. Boss Lyonie never got a chance to call off the invasion. And it's almost dusk. Jar Jar, you're a senator, you have to tell them to stand down. They'll listen to you. These Gungans are proud. With the mood at the moment, mesa the last person they'll listen to now. Huh. I don't believe it. The resemblance is remarkable. Who resembles what? You. You look just like Boss Lyonie. I didn't realize it until you put the crown on. This gives me an idea. Jar Jar, you must put on Lyonie's robes and keep that crown on. Oh, no, no! Mesa can't do that. You have to if we're going to convince the Gungan army to stand down. But they never listen to mesa. Maybe not, but they will listen to Boss Lyonie. But we all don't look alike! This a sad day for all Gungans. Our beloved leader, Boss Lyonie, is dead. We must honor his last order and prepare for our attack against the Naboo. We march with the Separatist droid army on Theed! Death to the Naboo! This bad. This very bad. Get up there and stop the attack. Er Mesa can't do it. You can't, but Boss Lyonie can. Now get out there. It's Boss Lyonie. He's alive. Say something. I He is alive, he is. Mesa Mesa fellow Gungans. Mesa made terrible mistake ordering march on Theed. We canceling our attack. It is Boss Lyonie. It's working. Rish Loo manipulated mesa head-thoughts with lies and misinformation. He's the real enemy. No, no! Good work, now try not to mess this up, Boss Lyonie. Battle droids? What they doing here? They think we still allies because of Rish Loo. Our General wishes to speak with you about the canceled attack. - Jar Jar? - No, Lyonie. Mesa Boss Lyonie. Mesa talk to the General. Follow me. Come in, Minister Lyonie. Let's sit down and have a talk. Has this seat been taken? Here. So I hear you have decided not to aid our attack on the Naboo. Oh, yes. Yes. We must put end to unfortunate, unfortunate bang-bang conflict. It was a great effort and cost for me to bring my armies here. Mesa sorry that Boss Excuse me. Ahem. Mesa was receiving mui bad advice. If you won't attack the Naboo, I will. Hold that thought. General Tarpals! Yes, Boss? You need to do that. That thing, that big troop thing. What did you just say? Go, go. Mesa Mesa just telling General that we must make the immediate arrangement for a Gungan-Separatist attack. Senator, mesa has urgent message from Boss Lyonie. He say General Grievous is here. Grievous is here? Where's Anakin? He's chasing Rish Loo. General Tarpals, listen to me, you must capture Grievous. But how? There's too many droids helping him. The droid commander still thinks you're on the same side, have the droids shut down, then attack. It's the only way. Grievous is a bombad warrior, but we shall do as you say. I always be believing in the friendship between Gungans and the Naboo. Thank you, General. Oh! What are we waiting for? Hmm. Planning attack take time. You are a man of few words, Boss Lyonie. Well, mesa more of a deep thinker. You are not Boss Lyonie. You have no idea of the power within my grasp. Uh-oh! Huh? You army is shut down, General. Mesa suggest you surrender. You can't be serious? How does it feel to die? Not die. Sacrifice. Jar Jar, now! Huh? This turn of events is unfortunate. General Grievous is a critical part of my plan for the Clone Wars. He must not remain captive. What is to be done, my lord? You must lure Skywalker into a trap, then negotiate a prisoner exchange. How can you be certain the Republic will trade Grievous for Skywalker? I have no doubt SenatorAmidala will gladly agree to your terms. As you wish, my lord. - Rish Loo. - Yes, Count? I am at your secret laboratory. Meet me here and leave enough of a trail for Skywalker to follow you. I have a surprise waiting for him. Master, I have done what you asked. Skywalker is here. Young Master Skywalker, you're nothing if not relentless. - What a surprise. - Dooku. You're a fool, Rish Loo. Why bring the war to Naboo? How quickly you forget. After all, the war started here years ago. You were a part of that first battle? The Sith control everything, you just don't know it. Where's Ani? He been gone mui long time. I'm not sure, Jar Jar. Anakin! Senator Amidala, we meet again. I must regretfully inform you that young Skywalker has been detained. What have you done with Anakin? Now, now, Senator, let's not become emotional. What do you want, Dooku? I'm glad you asked. I could be persuaded to return Skywalker to you in exchange for General Grievous. I can't do that. I'm sorry. You soon will be. Stop! You cannot torture a prisoner. Torture? I don't know what you mean. I'll give you an hour to consider my proposition. I'm sure you will make the right choice. You have to trade with him. I can't, Jar Jar. With Grievous captured, we could win the war. But, Padm\u00c3\u00a9, he's our friend. I know. I know, Jar Jar. Mesa think you have to deal. You should listen to Binks, he's right. Release the General. Padm\u00c3\u00a9, I'm sorry. Shh. It's all right, Ani. Binks, you been bombad leader in my place. This a second time you stopping war between us and the Naboo. And we are grateful, Senator Binks.

After surviving the ordeals of \"The Box,\" Obi-Wan Kenobi, working undercover as assassin Rako Hardeen, is invited to join Count Dooku's plot against Chancellor Palpatine. Working with a team of deadly bounty hunters, Obi-Wan travels to the planet of Naboo where the Chancellor will preside over the Festival of Light. Now, as the Jedi Council and Count Dooku finalize their respective plans, a deadly confrontation seems inevitable. As you can see, we've mapped the Chancellor's route to and from the festival stage. We know where he'll be at every moment from the time we land on Naboo. What security measures are in place? The Naboo Royal Guard will have armed sentries at all entry points on the palace. And the stage itself will be sealed off by a ray shield for the duration of the event. I see nothing here to worry about. With complacency comes vulnerability. Yes. It is what we do not see that concerns me. A long time to plan his attack, Count Dooku has. Yes. We thought we'd have an advantage with Obi-Wan on the inside, but we've had no communication from him in days. Obi-Wan will do his part. Let's make sure we do ours. Whoa! Shh! Well, hello there. All clear! This is it, my friends. The day of reckoning for the Republic. I have it from a very reliable source that everything will happen exactly as we planned. Execute your roles as you've been instructed, and you will all be immortalized in history. Not to mention, rewarded with enough credits that you will never have to work again. I will let Cad Bane take it from here. Listen up, I'm only saying it once. Each device tells you your position and essential details about your part of the plot. Aren't you gonna tell us how all the pieces fit together? Derrown here is going to breach the shield. Moralo Eval is the getaway driver. Two of you will act as guards protecting the Chancellor. And you, Hardeen, are a sniper. That's all you need to know. Once we have the Chancellor, the devices will lead you to the rendezvous point. Any questions? Now for our disguises. Everyone step back. This will get us into the inner circle. Step into the shadow hologram and you will receive your new identity. When you leave here, you will have no communication with the rest of the team. All right, then, get to your positions. Well handled. I should have put you in charge long ago. A word of advice, though, keep an eye on Hardeen. There's something about him I do not trust. Don't worry. I'm keeping my eye on all of them. Greetings, Your Majesty. Welcome home, Chancellor. I'm thankful to the Jedi for bringing you here safely. Yes, Senator, it is good to be back, although I think the amount of security that has accompanied me is overkill. With all due respect, Chancellor, where your safety is concerned there is no such thing as overkill. So you keep insisting, Master Jedi. But I've grown tired of discussing it. Anakin, Ahsoka, welcome to the festival. I've never seen the Festival of Light. Sounds like a big event. They're expecting a large crowd, which means it will be difficult for Dooku to attack during the ceremony. That leaves the palace as the best opportunity for an ambush. Are you that certain an attack is imminent? I'm afraid so, which is why I'm making Ahsoka your personal bodyguard. At your service, My Lady. If there's trouble, Ahsoka will get you, the Queen, and the rest of your staff to safety. What about you? Hopefully, I'll be where I always am. - He means saving the day. - Of course he does. Make sure you have two guards posted. Excuse me. - Obi-Wan, thank goodness you're alive. - Yes, I've seen better days. I'm here, in Theed. So Dooku's plan is still on? - Yes. How are they planning to attack the Chancellor? Three of the bounty hunters are disguised as senate guards. Eval is the getaway driver and they have a Parwan that can pass through the ray shield. I have a sniper rifle. Don't worry. It's loaded with stun blasts. I'm supposed to immobilize the Chancellor, not kill him. Where are you? In a tower overlooking the plaza. So the attack is going to take place outside. Yes. From here, I can be your eye in the sky. I'll be able to tell you everything that's going on. They will try to infiltrate the security area. Make sure you have someone double check the guards' identities. That's going to take time. You'll have to do your best, my friend. The stage is set. Activate the ray shield. Copy that, General Skywalker. It is an honor to be here for this momentous occasion. The pride I feel for this planet cannot be put into words. and tonight we celebrate that union! What's your identification number? SG-1984. All right, move along, but stay sharp. Take a moment and look around this glorious city of yours. It wasn't long ago this was all plasma mines. Naboo has indeed come a long way. But as we chart a bold course for the future, let us never forget our past! Mace, so far so good. Gotcha! East side! The security guard on the stairs. Skywalker! The shield generator! All right, you two, take the Chancellor to that speeder and get him out of here. This way, Your Majesty. Hurry! Blast! It's only good for one shot. Mace, Anakin's down and I don't see Bane anywhere. I'll find him. Let's make the switch. You're coming with me, Chancellor. Those tentacles pack quite a punch. Come on. The Chancellor! The guard escorting them is a bounty hunter! Chancellor, are you all right? Where is the Chancellor? Move it, move it! So long, Jedi! I'm going after the Chancellor. Copy that, Obi-Wan. I'll send you the coordinates and hold Bane there as long as I can. This is the rendezvous point. Dooku said he would meet us here. What did I tell you, Bane? My plan worked to perfection. It wasn't your plan. It was my execution of your plan. Come on, get up. How dare you disrespect Moralo Eval! Pipe down. Where's Dooku? I thought you said he'd meet us here? That was the plan. Hardeen, you're not supposed to be here yet. I don't want to be double-crossed and left behind again. I think we've all been double-crossed. Dooku's a no-show. What do you mean? What do we do with the Chancellor now? We'll ransom him ourselves. If Dooku won't pay us, somebody else will. I'm afraid the Chancellor's coming with me. Please! Do not kill Moralo Eval! Take him and Bane into custody. And make sure the Chancellor is returned safely to the palace. You did a good job, Obi-Wan. Kenobi! I should have known. Something smelled wrong about you from the start. Yes, well, spending so much time with you was no reward either. Reward! I'll give you a reward, when I plug you full of laser bolts! Such a pleasant fellow. I hope this was all worth it. We saved the Chancellor. That's the important thing. Once again, you have all distinguished yourselves in the eyes of the Republic. The people of Naboo are in your debt. It's all part of the job, My Lady. I'm not sure I agree with your orders to send the rest of the security detail back to Coruscant. Now that the threat has passed, I think Anakin is all the security I need. You look terrible. Being a criminal's not easy work. If I'd known what was going on, I could've helped you. Too bad the Council didn't trust me. Anakin, it was my decision to keep the truth from you. I knew if you were convinced I was dead, Dooku would believe it as well. Your decision? Look, I know I did some questionable things, but I did what I had to do. I hope you can understand that. You lied to me! How many other lies have I been told by the Council? And how do you know that you even have the whole truth? We should get you into the transformation chamber. Everyone's a little tired of looking at that ugly face of yours. This is the face that saved the Republic. But I think you're right. It's time to go back to being Obi-Wan Kenobi. I can sense something is still bothering you. Yes, something Anakin said has me worried. Do we know the whole truth? I think I'll stay. I need to check one last thing. Dooku was listening! He knew all along. We will leave as soon as Queen Neeyutnee's banquet is over. I also want to say goodbye to Senator Amidala. She has been a very gracious host. Hmm. Padm\u00c3\u00a9 didn't mention a banquet to me. Perhaps she meant it as a surprise. I must say, the lengths the Jedi will go to is nothing short of incredible. I assume the brilliant plan to disguise Obi-Wan Kenobi was yours. No, it wasn't, sir. I was in the dark as much as you were. Really? Interesting. I was under the impression the Jedi always worked as a team. Welcome! My gracious, it's a trap! Chancellor, stay back! You should've quit while you were still alive, Dooku! Fighting off the entire Jedi security force would have been difficult. But now that they are gone, defeating you alone will be an easy task. Chancellor, get out of here! Good idea. Unhand me! Are you all right? Come on! Well done, Master Kenobi. You are a worthy adversary. I cannot say the same about your young apprentice. Chancellor, are you all right? Yes, thanks again to the heroics of the Jedi. That's the second time today. We specialize in heroics, Chancellor. As long as I live, no harm will ever come to you, Your Excellency. Hmm. Well, here's to your long and prosperous life, Anakin. One shudders to think where the galaxy would be without the Jedi.   \n                "}, "Destiny": {"episode": "s06e12", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t6x12 - \"Destiny\"  Blinded by the dark side! The Jedi Council has begun to unravel the mystery of how the clone army was created and now fear the Sith Lord Count Dooku was behind it. Master Yoda searches for answers, and during deep meditation, he is able to contact the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn, who reveals to Yoda that he must manifest his consciousness after death if he is to preserve the Jedi Order. Now we find Master Yoda deep in space, searching for a path to ones who will teach him all he does not know of the Force. The place Qui-Gon spoke of I believe this is. So blocking our scanners the gas is, but inside a planet may be. Mm, sense it, I do. Controlling this are you? Let the Force guide, I will. Hmm, awake again you are, my little friend. Where we are, I'm not sure, but strong with the Force this place is. There, you see? From inside the planet, life emanates. Here nothing your scanners can see, hmm? Need this I will not. No, wait here you must. A journey for me alone this is. Safer here you are, my friend. Yoda. Who is there? Yoda. Traveled far I have, looking for those who can teach me. The question is, are you worthy of being taught? You are late. We have been waiting for you, Master Yoda. Late? How did you know, coming, I was? We watch and study all who are strong with the Force in the universe. Now, come, if we are to begin. Cousins, I have a guest. You should not have brought him before us. Oh, nonsense. He is full of the Force. Can you not feel it? Why is he here? Why are you here? Told I was to learn from you, that show me you could how to manifest my life after death. Oh, it's impossible. He will fail with the great gift. He will disappoint us. He will disappoint himself. Oh, no. No, I do not see that. His destiny is already set. It is not for us to decide. But why him? He is to teach one that will save the universe from a great imbalance. For this, the great gift will be his. He has no idea what he seeks, the responsibility he will have. Understand I do not. Guide me I know you will. And do you realize what you must do, what you must face? No. Good. Then you won't be afraid. Do I have a blessing that the training can begin? It is so. We are one, and one is all. Do you come to us with only good intention and light in your heart? I do. Yes. Then the blessing I give, and the training will begin. Disappoint us not, little green one. What is this place? All that surrounds us is the foundation of life, the birthplace of what your science calls midi-chlorians, the foundation of what connects the Living Force and the Cosmic Force. When a living thing dies, all is removed. Life passes from the Living Force into the Cosmic Force and becomes one with it. One powers the other. One is renewed by the other. This I know. Come with me. At death, in order for you to preserve your identity, you must know yourself, your true self, and then let go. On that island dwells all that remains unconquered, what, in your existence, some call evil, otherwise known as fear, all which must be finally overcome before the journey can be taken. Free yourself, you must. A Jedi Master I am. Know all that dwells within I do. Mastered my weaknesses and conquered my fears I have. Have you? You must face your evil on that island and defeat it.

I choose not to give you power. And yet you spend your days in the decadence of war, and with that, I grow inside you. Know your true self. Face me now or I will devour you. Part of me you are not. Part of you I am, part of all that lives. Why do you hate what gives you power? Yoda thinks me not worthy. Recognize you I do. Huh? Part of me you are, yes. But power over me you have not. Through patience and training, it is I who control you. Control over me you have not. My dark side you are. Reject you I do. You have conquered your hubris. Now face the temptations you must.

You told me I would finish my training and become a Jedi, but the Council expelled me. Why would you do that? Will I still become one with the Force when I die? Master, will I be a Jedi? Padawan. Padawan? Ahsoka, no. No. No. Not strong enough I was. No. Failed I have, failed them all. Master Yoda. Let me take you away from your confusion, your anger, your sadness.

Returning from a perilous assignment in The Outer Rim, Jedi Master Even Piell's cruiser has fallen under attack, and been boarded. Seeking vital information he carries about secret Hyperspace lanes called The Nexus Route, Separatist forces have taken him alive. Now the jedi are preparing a stealth mission into the heart, of separatist space in an effort to rescue Master Piell. From the deadly prison known as, The Citadel. As you are aware, The citadel is their most. Isolated and impenetrable. Detention facility. No one has ever escaped. There's a first time for everything. Indeed there is. Their security has prevented our probes from obtaining recent reconnaissance, so we've been forced to construct a crude map based upon data from the archives. And since the data is extremely old, the map will be difficult to rely on. So we're essentially going in, blind. Beg your pardon, General, But how do we know Master Piell is still alive? The Separatists won't dare kill Master Piell until they have what they need. He obtained the coordinates of a secret Hyperspace lane Known as The Nexus Route which travels into the heart of both The Republic and Separatist homeworlds. They could prove vital in maneuvering our forces deep into remote Separatist sectors. Or the enemy could use them, to slip through our defenses. And attack Coruscant. These Hyperspace lanes are of immense interest to both our sides and could tip the scale of the war to whomever is in possession of them. That is all. Based on the archive schematics, we've narrowed it down to Three possible locations they could be holding him at. My greatest concern is, infiltrating their outer security. The life-form scanners will not. Be easy to fool. - I've got a thought about that. - Master. I'm sorry I'm late. I just heard about the briefing. We're going to rescue Master Piell, right? You two have much to discuss. Ahsoka, I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, but you won't be coming along on this one. Not coming? But you're breaking into the Citadel. No one's ever done it. The citadel wasn't designed to hold common criminals. It was created to hold Jedi if any of us lost our way. It's not a place for Padawans. You're just being protective, again. That's not fair. How am I supposed to learn if you won't let me share the risk? This isn't a mission for learning. You either do or die. And that's not a risk I'm willing to share. Artoo, look out behind you. You're being followed by Battle Droids! These are your troops? They're Battle Droids. What do you mean, they've been reprogrammed to follow your orders? We are awaiting your word, Commander. You heard him. Move out. Don't you go thumbing your. Gears at me just because you. Have a bunch of dim-witted. Droids following you about. Oh! Really. We're trusting those droids. To get us into the citadel? It's the only way. We're flying right into the. Heart of separatist territory. Droids won't be detected. Artoo, make sure they don't. Stray from the flight plan. It's all under control, sir. I was talking to artoo. Master Plo? May I speak with you? What is it, little 'soka? It's about the mission. Master Skywalker doesn't want me. To go. That is his choice.

Strong for jetpacks. Yes, we'll have to do it the. Old-fashioned way, with. Ascension cables and a steel. Grip. I don't think so. What do you mean? Electro-mines. There's nowhere to put. A grappling hook at that height, And we hit one of those, the. Mission's over. They'll know we're here. I suppose that means we. Free-climb it. you hanging in there, snips? Couldn't be better.

There's an opening up there. We know. They're ventilation ducts, But they're far too small. For us to gain access. Too small for you maybe, but I think I can squeeze through.

It's going to be impossible to. Escape. What if we split up? My team will create a diversion, While anakin leads the others. Away. That way, if one of us is. Captured, the enemy will only. Have part of the information. And not all of it. General kenobi, I think it's. Better if we stick together. A stronger force would have. A better chance of protecting. The information. Not in this situation. But surely we'd have more. Strength in numbers, Rather than divide us. Obi-wan has a point. I'll go with him; you go with Skywalker. they escaped, sir.

There's nothing to indicate the presence of an enemy outpost. Master, I'm receiving a strange transmission. I can't seem to make it out, though. Boost the volume, Goldie. No, you're losing it. - That's R2. - That doesn't sound like R2. It's him. I could never forget that voice. - Trace it, Rex. - Sir. What is going on here? You sneaky little scrap pile. You'd better be worth all this trouble. Master, our orders were to find the Separatist listening post. Perhaps R2 is at the listening post. Did you consider that? We have a lock on the droid's location, sir. - Prepare to jump to those coordinates. - Yes, sir. Hold on, R2, old buddy. We're coming. What is it, Gha Nachkt? I've arrived. Could you lower your shields? Keep moving, grease spot. This is the droid those Jedi came looking for, General. What secrets do you carry, my little friend? So defiant. No need for fear. We're all droids here. Rip this little rat apart, and find out everything he knows. Right away, General. Sir, the last transmission came from that moon's upper atmosphere, directly ahead. That's a Separatist battle sphere. I'm picking up a lot of encrypted chatter. Contact Obi-Wan. Stubby, scramble secret code set 1477. I don't want that station to pick this up. - Anakin? - Master, I believe we've found your Separatist listening post. Excellent work. Back off and wait. I'll send 2 mainline cruisers to help you destroy it. But R2? We believe my droid, R2, is on board. He's the one that led us here. This complicates things. You must sneak aboard that station and destroy it before they crack R2's memory banks. I know you're fond of that droid, but he's fallen into enemy hands. I could rescue R2. No, this is not a rescue mission. Keep jamming their scanners. If they spot us, we're dead. We're bringing the droid? We'll need Goldie to open secured hatches and access the station's computer for us. And Rex, you get to carry him. That's just great. Follow me, boys! Take this upstairs, and be sure not to drop it. Those 631s are not the brightest lights on the ship. Next time, you're lugging this astromech around. All this moisture is corroding my servo-motors. Go up to level eight.

I hope you find R2 in one piece. Get going, Snips. Looks like it's up to us to complete the mission As usual. This is General Grievous! What is it? It appears this droid's mission memory has never been erased. It contains every Republic formation and strategy they have. Good work. You certainly earned your fee this time. More than my fee.

What are you doing back here? Come on. Now, we will transfer all your secrets to me. Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you. Republic troops have infiltrated the base. Keep this droid secure. I will deal with the Jedi myself. We found the reactor room, sir. The alarm triggered another security door, ray-shielded. - This could take a while to bypass. - Good luck with that. Go ahead, Goldie. Make me proud. This'll be good. Those droids are getting close.

Patience, Captain. - I can always hot-wire it, sir. - Hurry up, Goldie. - I think we've run out of time. - Blast 'em! - Rex, droid poppers, now! - Droid poppers! Take the captured R2 unit to my ship. They sent a child to destroy my station? The Republic must be running out of Jedi. You must be General Grievous. He's just another tinny, boys. Let's scrap him like the rest. Sorry to interrupt your playtime, grumpy, but wouldn't you prefer a challenge? That wouldn't be you. All units, stay on high alert. Watch out for a second Jedi loose in the station. R2! Hang on, R2! Where is the fight you promised me, youngling? Ahsoka, it's me, Rex. There are only two of us left. Should we abort the mission? No, complete the mission. Set the charges, and rendezvous at the landing bay. - But, sir - That's an order, Rex. I'll keep the General busy. Ahsoka out. She's distracting Grievous. Come on. We still got a job to do. Come here, child. I'm looking for you. So far, you have failed to impress me. Goldie, over here. Ahsoka, we're in the reactor Your friends won't help you. You're stuck with me. You have something that belongs to me. Thanks, R2. It's great to see you too, buddy. You don't look so good. You okay? Rex? Rex, can you hear me? R3? R3, is that you? I've got R2. I'll meet you back at the landing bay. R3? Yeah, I had to get a replacement droid. Look, sorry, R2. It was Obi-Wan's idea. Look, we'll talk about this later. Twilight, this is Skywalker. Rendezvous at the south landing bay immediately for evacuation. Acknowledged, General. I'm on my way. R3, what have you to report? That stubby little backstabber. So Skywalker has come for his R2 unit. Go and make certain they do not escape. Great, there's the Twilight. Now where's everyone else? Sir. Hey, stubby, where's Ahsoka? General Skywalker. Explosives are in place, sir. Objective completed. - Where is Ahsoka? - She engaged General Grievous. Alone? She distracted him while we completed the mission. It was on her orders, sir. The droid was with her. - We got to find her. - I can take you to her, sir. What is the matter with you? Are you trying to get us killed? I've got a bad feeling about this, sir. That double-crossing droid is a spy. Another lightsaber to add to my collection. My spy droid, R3, has trapped your precious master. When I've finished with you, he's next. You're wrong. He's gone by now, and he's going to blow up your precious spy station. Not this time. Captain, trigger the explosives. But, sir, we're still in the station. You just let me worry about the details. Sir. Yes, sir. R2, I need you to get the hangar door open. See if there are any controls on the outer platform. So what did I miss? The usual. It was foolish of you to take on Grievous by yourself. Well, I was leading the mission, and it seemed like a good idea at the time. Did he tell you your stubby little gold droid pal works for him? He might have mentioned it. I guess we were all fooled. General Skywalker, there are fuel cells over here. Get ready, Rex. - R2 did it. - Of course he did it. Now let's get out of here. R2, where are you? General Skywalker has gotten into his fighter. Where's he going? He's going after R2. I'll be right back. Don't wait for me. Come on, R2. So let me get this straight, Anakin. You risked the mission, all your men, even your padawan to save a droid. R2 found the listening post, and he saved our lives. We couldn't just leave him there, Obi-Wan. Anakin. One day I'm glad we got R2 back, master. But Obi-Wan does have a point. Ahsoka, I knew you would complete the mission. Besides, R2 is more than a droid. He's a friend.   \n                "}, "Grievous Intrigue / The Deserter": {"episode": "s02e09", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThough Republic victories outnumber their losses, the Jedi have been unable to stop Separatist advances in the Outer Rim.

Grievous is boarding. - Status report. - There's too many of them. Get yourselves to the escape pods. I will deal with Grievous here. But, sir, they're commando droids. That does not matter, Captain. Now go. Jedi. Grievous. Eeth Koth, isn't it? I've been looking forward to meeting you. Your reputation precedes you, General. Reputation of a coward and a murderer. Murederer? Is it murder to rip the galaxy of you Jedi filth? Greetings, Jedi, it would seem, once again, one of your order has lost his way and even better, a leading member of your Jedi Council. Listen to me, Jedi, I do not care about your politics. I do not care about your Republic. I only live to see you die. But death will not come so easily for Master Koth. I will make him suffer endlessly because I know that is more painful for you all. He's a monster. Away with the younglings. Much there is to discuss. It's time somebody finally put an end to that monster. On that, agreed we are. How to find him, the question remains. After engaging Grievous, we lost contact with Master Koth. He could be anywhere. Commander Wolffe has found a message in the holo transmission. Play back the message. Look. Hand signals. I admit my skills are rusty, but Saleucami system, sector J-19. Zero-eight, zero-five, two-nine. Saleucami? But intelligence reported Grievous has no ships near that sector. But so often inaccurate our intelligence is. I shall go. So will I. And I. Are you ready? Ready and waiting. I shall engage the Separatist fleet and send you the coordinates of Grievous' command ship. Just make sure you get it right. I always do. How do you plan on getting Grievous aboard your ship? Not to worry. The good General and I have a history. I'm sure he'll want to even the score face-to-face. Meanwhile, we'll jump in undetected and board the command ship. If Master Koth is still alive, you will find him. Hopefully, by the end of this mission, we will have saved Master Koth and captured General Grievous. Sir, we have entered the Saleucami system. Begin preparations for our landing. Yes, my lord. There are several ships coming out of hyperspace. Are they Republic or Separatist? Republic. Three cruiser-class, four escort-class. You see? Your compassionate friends have come to rescue you, just as I knew they would. One of the Republic ships is hailing us, my lord. Put him through. General, I knew one day I'd catch up to you. Kenobi! What a surprise. I assume you are here to bring me to justice. You know me too well. Indeed, I do. Prepare to fire all cannons. And be alert. Where there is Kenobi, you will always find Skywalker not far behind. The enemy ships are faster and more maneuverable. I suggest caution. Draw them in. I want to board that vessel. I shall kill Kenobi face-to-face. We certainly have his attention. Admiral Yularen, keep Grievous' fleet occupied so Anakin's arrival is undetected. Yes, General. Commence attack. All ships fire at will. Yes, sir. We're moving in. Commander Cody, do you have the exact coordinates of the command ship yet? We're patching them through now, sir. We are receiving the coordinates from General Kenobi. How close are you going to jump in next to Grievous' ship? Pretty close. Buckle up, boys. Define \"pretty close.\" Close enough to get the job done. Get me a tractor beam lock on Kenobi's ship and prepare a boarding party. Tractor beam has us, sir. Shall we fire on the source? No, Cody. Let them think they have us. We need a diversion for Anakin. Coming out of hyperspace. Hang on. Primary power down. So, was that close enough for you? Any closer, and we'd be flying down hallways. Next time. Coast is clear, Rex. Copy that, sir. Stay here and guard the entrance. This may be our only way out. Skywalker, Master Koth is located on the bridge. This way. Remember, we need to keep Grievous on this ship until General Skywalker is clear. Kenobi. How we doing? We are close. So, Kenobi, is everything going as planned? That depends on your point of view, General. You wouldn't come here without a plan, and you wouldn't come alone. Tell me, do you think Skywalker has rescued Master Koth yet? Surprise. Not exactly. At least, they're not destroyer droids. The General's description of your tactics have been 100% accurate today. Very impressive, even by my standards. Your plans have come to ruination, Jedi. I hear a lot of talking, General, but in the final accounting, what does all the talk get you? A futile quest for power, a mutilated body, and your place as Dooku's errand boy. I'm no errand boy. I am not in this war for Dooku's politics. I am the leader of the most powerful droid army the galaxy has ever seen. An army with no loyalty, no spirit, just programming. Why do you need to show all your power? What have you to gain? The future, a future where there are no Jedi. The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi ends here. One more step, and your friend will die. Your friends shall die, Kenobi, and you shall soon follow. Got to get it Behind you. I see you got my message. Where's Grievous? If everything's gone according to plan, he's on board Obi-Wan's ship. He's been captured? If we can cut off his escape, there's a good chance of that. Surrender, General. Never! I hope you've rescued Master Koth, because Grievous is headed back to his ship. You both go. I'll make it back. I'll be fine. I'll have to disagree with you on that one. Master Gallia, you go ahead. I'll get Eeth back to the shuttle. May the Force by with you. Get back to the bridge. We need to detach before Grievous jumps ship. Cody, come in. - Yes, sir. - Grievous is heading your way. Open fire on the Republic ship. Target their engines. But, sir, the ships are still attached. It doesn't matter. Prepare all troops for our landing on Saleucami. The circuits are fried. We have no controls. I can't even get the engines online. We've lost our stabilizers. I can't hold her steady. Until we meet again, Kenobi. Hurry. We can still catch him. Obi-Wan, Anakin's leaving. We'll be trapped on the ship. Anakin, come in. We're in a bit of a spot, and we need a way off of Grievous' ship. There's a large hangar near your position. Make your way there, and I'll pick you up. All droids to the landing craft. Get to your stations. We're going to detach. Prepare to launch. The reactor's been breached. I can't lock it down! Here we go. Anakin, get me Admiral Yularen. Several craft detached from Grievous' ship and attempted to land on Saleucami. Then we'll have to land and follow them. Prepare the tanks. Yes, sir. There must be several landing sites. It may be hard to locate the good General. You'll have to command the space battle while Rex, Cody, and I head to the surface. You sure you can handle this on your own? I think I can manage. I'll get Master Koth to a medical frigate. You all took a great risk rescuing me. You're welcome, Master Koth. Since you divided your forces, Grievous is still at large. I would have gladly given my life if it meant bringing that monster to justice! At least we all live to fight another day. Fugitive! Though the Republic has won many decisive battles against the Separatist army in the Outer Rim, the Jedi have failed to capture the elusive General Grievous. After specifically targeting members of the Jedi Council, a trap was set, but following a fierce confrontation, the droid General managed to escape to the surface of the planet Saleucami. Now the chase is on as General Kenobi leads a squadron of clone troopers and closes in on his target. We must find a way off this planet before they find us. We need to hurry and find an escape pod. Instead of scattering our troops looking for all the escape pods, we shall head towards the wreckage of the landing transport first. Contact the fleet. Our transmitter is destroyed. There is only one escape pod that survived. We must get there as quickly as possible. Let's hope the transmitter is still intact. Now, find me some transportation. Sir, the cruiser's returned to orbit. Any sign of Grievous? I believe we've found Grievous' ship. Power low. Shutting down. I can't go on. Sir, we need to get our power recharged. Not this again! How could your power cells be so depleted? You would not let us ride on one of those creatures with you, sir. If you would allow us to close down for a few Any more complaints? I don't think so. That's what I thought. Now let's find that pod. Yikes. Normalizing intakes are still warm. This couldn't have happened too long ago. The crew compartment's almost entirely destroyed. We'll split into teams. Rex, take Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix - and search those wetlands. - Yes, sir. Cody, you, Crys, and I will pick it up from here. And Rex, if you get a visual on Grievous, contact us before you engage. - Rex is a smart man. - Indeed. Always thinking on his feet. These droids are too gone to give us any good intel. Here's one! Let's load the droid in the tank. We'll inspect it on the go. In range. Take the shot. Protect the Captain. Commando droids. Jesse, you better get back here. What do you have? We've broken the access codes and powered up the droid's guidance system. According to his memory logs, he fired the emergency thrusters on the escape pod to avoid a mid-air collision. - Collision with what? - Another escape pod. There was no time to correct for the steeper glide path, which is why this droid's pod crashed. Can you pinpoint the landing zone for the other pod? I can put us within two to three klicks of it, sir. Alert the men. We've picked up the scent. How bad? Pretty bad. I need to remove his armor to see the full extent of the damage. Those snipers might have called for backup. Unless we want to start getting picked off one by one, we should find a better cover first. Wait a minute. Those critters are domesticated. I think we're on farmland, and where there's a farm, there's a usually a farmer. Let's find his homestead. We want no trouble here. Easy with that weapon, ma'am. We're here as friends. - State your business. - Our Captain's been hurt. We need - I'm no doctor, so just - We have a medic, ma'am. We just need a place to tend him overnight. - Who's - Get back inside, both you. Mom. There are some benches out back in the barn. - It's the best I can do. - That'll be fine, ma'am. What? What happened? Commando droids took a potshot. That would've gone through your heart had it been two inches to the left. I can't move my arm. - You have some nerve damage. - Understood. Now patch me up and let's get on with it. Sir, you're in no condition. It will heal, but it'll take time. We're getting under way, Kix. That's an order. Sir, as the team medic, when it comes to the health of the men, including you, I outrank everyone. So, I respectfully order you, sir, to get some Excuse me. - If there's not enough - That's plenty. - Thank you - Suu. I told you to stay in the house. I couldn't help it, mom. It got away. You look like my daddy. Don't bother the soldier. - Now get inside with your brother. - Yes, mom. My husband is away delivering our first harvest. Do you require anything else? Resume the search without me. You're in command. I'll be fine. There's our escape pod. Any sign of Grievous? It looks deserted. He must be heading to a second escape pod. - Captain Rex, come in, please. - It's Jesse, sir. - Rex was injured. - What's his condition? He'll be fine, but we had to find him shelter tonight. Grievous is on the move. We're headed to the west. Swing around and we can meet up at the final escape pod. We're going to need all the firepower we can muster. Roger that, sir. We're speeding towards you. We should be there by now! We are, sir, there. Almost. You had better be interpreting the coordinates correctly. We're almost there, sir. One klick out. Straight ahead. I'm losing power. Who are you? What are you doing here? You're a clone. So I see the war has finally made its way out here, and I guess I can expect a visit from some droids soon. What's your number and rank? My name is Lawquane. Cut Lawquane. And I'm just a simple farmer. You're a deserter. I like to think I'm merely exercising my freedom to choose: to choose not to kill for a living. That is not your choice to make. You swore an oath to the Republic. You have a duty. I have a duty, you're right. But it's to my family. Does that count, or do you still plan to turn me in? - Do I have a choice? - Daddy! You're home! Look what I drew you, dad! That's great, Jek. I see you two have met. He looks just like you, daddy. I told him. You did. I was just making our guest, Captain What's your number? I also have a name, believe it or not. He was injured. His men brought him here. I told him he could stay just for the night. Of course he can. We never turn away those in need, do we? No, we always help anyone we can. Right. You look hungry, Rex. No, I'm fine. I'll stay here. - You have to eat with us. Please. - Please? They're never going to stop till you say yes. All right. I'll join you. You and I may be clones, but we're still individuals. You have a name rather than a number, Captain. Why is that? Perhaps our leaders feel it's a more efficient way of distinguishing us. More efficient than a number? I doubt the Kaminoans think that way. Still, a name has to make you feel unique, especially in an army where everyone looks like you and talks Actually, I never really thought about it. Yes, you have. How would you know? Because I'm as close to you as any life-form can be. I've seen how you look at my family, our home. Come on, Rex, admit it. You've thought about what your life could look like if you were to also leave the army, choose the life you want. What if I am choosing the life I want? What if I'm staying in the army because it's meaningful to me? And how is it meaningful? Because I'm part of the most pivotal moment in the history of the Republic. If we fail, then our children and their children could be forced to live under an evil I can't well imagine. If you were to have children, of course, but that would be against the rules, wouldn't it? Isn't that what somebody programmed you to believe, Captain? No, Cut. It's simply what I believe. It doesn't matter if it's my children or other people's children. Does that meet with your approval? Perfectly. To each his own. That's what I always say. What does that mean, daddy? It means you can do anything with your life that you want to. - How are you doing, Jesse? - Closing in, sir. We have a visual. Very well. We'll meet you in the middle. Is your transmitter working? I don't know. I haven't used it yet. All right. I'll check on it. Stupid battle droids. Sir, you made it. Get back in the pod and send out a distress signal towards the rest of our fleet. We need to get a shuttle down here immediately. Roger, roger. But I must inform you, sir, there are multiple life-forms approaching from the east and west. Battle positions! Good move. Very good move. So what was it? What made me decide to leave the corps? Shortly after the battle of Geonosis, our troop transport got caught between two Separatist gunships. They fired at us with everything they had. We crashed. Most of us were either dead or severely injured. So when they started working their way through the wounded, killing us off, I knew there was no hope. I ran. It still haunts me. I'm sorry. It's the day I felt my life didn't have any meaning. Everyone I cared about, my team, was gone. I was just another expendable clone waiting for my turn to be slaughtered in a war that made no sense to me. Can you understand that, Rex? I've been in countless battles and lost many brothers. They were my family. My home. Daddy, we finished our chores. - Can we go outside and play? - Please? Okay, only for a few minutes. Thank you, daddy. Come on, Jek. And keep the house in view. We will. You have wonderful children. I know you think I'm a coward, Rex, but believe me, I'll fight to my last breath to keep them safe. Fire! Tank two! Port side! Great shot! Where is that ship? Shaeeah? Where are you? Where are you? Stop fooling around. You are not funny. Am too. Look. In the field. What is it? It wasn't there before. It's some kind of spaceship, I think. Hello? Do you think somebody's in there? I didn't do it. You did. Monsters! - What's wrong? - Monsters. They're chasing us. What monsters? Honey, where? They hatched from the big egg in the field. This is not good. I count 20. Cut, what's out there? Commando droids. What are they doing? - Suu, get the kids upstairs. - Come. Come now. What weapons do you have? We can catch them in a cross fire. You take that corner. No, Captain. With respect, you're not in charge here. I can be useful. You're injured. You have only one good arm. But I can fight. So can I. Rex, I need you to be the last line of defense for my family. I'll take care of them. Thank you. Finally! General Grievous, sir. We see you below us. Are you ready to depart? Concentrate your fire on that ship. They're shooting at us. Coming back around. Sir, that ship's coming around for another landing attempt. Keep firing. Don't let that ship land. The guns are overheated! Always something. Cody, Jesse, cover me. General, behind you! They're coming for you! Daddy? I'm okay. It's over. Forget trying to land! Fire the engines. Jedi scum. Are you all right, sir? We're right back where we started. Call the cruisers. - See if they can stop that ship. - Right away, sir. And tell them to send someone to pick us up. All right, - that should do it. - Captain Rex. Are you going to turn in my husband? I'm sorry, Suu. It's my duty, but in my condition, I probably won't remember any of this. Thank you. You're still a deserter, Cut, but you're certainly not a coward. Captain Rex, are you still with us? Yes, General Kenobi. I'm still with you and thankfully on the mend, sir. That's great news. We certainly missed you at the party. Sorry, sir. I had to attend one of my own. Can't wait to hear about it. We're standing by. You're welcome to stay, Rex. This is your home, Cut. My family is elsewhere.   \n                "}, "The Disappeared (2)": {"episode": "s06e09", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t6x09 - \"The Disappeared\", part 2  Lost! Queen Julia of the planet Bardotta has been abducted. If Representative Jar Jar Binks and Jedi Master Mace Windu cannot find the missing Queen in three rotations, a sinister prophecy will be fulfilled. The bloodthirsty Frangawl cult will take over the Bardottan government, and its planetary system will be overwhelmed by chaos, death, and destruction. So tell me exactly what you saw when you were being held prisoner by the cultists. It's like mesa said. The cultists took one of the Dagoyan Masters and sacrificed him. Hesa got all crispy fried, and then theysa stole the Force right out of him and put it in a shiny ball. So the cultists are stealing living Force and trapping it in a containment sphere. Yes, deysa try to steal my living Force too, but yousa saved me. Hmm And now they plan to do the same thing with the Queen, but to what end? The Cultists couldn't exploit the living Force like a Jedi or a Sith. I sense something else a darker presence. Maxibig the Force, Masteren Mace, but howsa we gonna find the Queenie? She's still a prisoner. If the containment sphere has gathered enough of the living Force as you suggest, I will be able to sense its location. If we find the sphere, we will find the Queen. Okeyday. Wesa make a bombad team, Masteren Mace. Indeed. Where Where am I? Who are you? Jar Jar. Jar Jar, where are you? Unhand me! Sleep. No. No Brother, another vision of the Great Mother came to me. She said the Jedi knows of the sphere and that he is following us here with the Gungan. The Great Mother warned us our plan would be discovered if a Jedi ever came to Bardotta. We did not know the Gungan had such powerful friends. We must hurry. Once we sacrifice the Queen and transfer the living Force to the Great Mother, she will deal with the Jedi. Letsa get going. Calm yourself, Representative. Stay still. But wesa must hurry. That city, it'sa mooie big. Wesa have to move fast to catch the cultists. We cannot rush into this. We must remain calm and let the Force guide us. But maybe using da Force taking too longo, and they getting away. No, running blindly through the city will only waste time and allow them to escape. Now be still. Okeyday, Masteren Mace. I see people, market, streets. Yep, mesa see that from here too. I see crowds. Wait, a square a market square. And the sphere I see it and the Queen. Let's go. Wait, wait, mesa thought wesa not rushing in. That was before we knew where we were going. Now the chase is on. Mesa getting a creepin' feeling here. Do not center on your anxieties, Jar Jar. Keep moving. This way. This is it, the market square I saw through the Force. Stay alert. The Queen may be close by. I'm going topside for a better view. Okeyday. Uh, hello. Nope, no, thank you. Mesa already got one of those. Jar Jar, help! Huh? Julia? Jar Jar! Julia! Masteren Mace, come quick! Jar Jar, wait! Jar Jar, what in the Mesa bet they're bringing the Queenie this way. Help! Queenie! Jar Jar! Julia. I've got this. Keep after the Queen. Oh! Julia! Binks. Mesa need to be brave. Representative Binks. Masteren Mace, theysa went this way! Hurry! Stop them. Oh, boy. Masteren Mace! Queenie, mesa coming! Why are you stealing the living Force? The Shadow will come, the Great Mother. She will deal with you, Jedi. You will see. Have a nice nap. Deysa gone. Dey speeded away bombad fast. Wesa need some kind of ride. You're lucky I have no time to argue. Let's get moving. Hi-ya! The appointed time draws near. The sun and the moons are almost aligned. The Jedi is unyielding. He will arrive too late to save the Queen. I have seen it in my visions. Once the Great Mother is in possession of the sphere, she will combine her powers with the living Force, and a new order will arise. Huh-wah! Hee-wah! Hee-wah! Jar Jar! Hee-wah? Jar Jar, please. Oh, mesa sorry, Masteren Mace. I'm just worried about the Queenie. I understand your fears, and I am trying to help you. But for now, keep your mind focused on the task at hand. That is the best way you can help your friend. Whysa you thinking they want Queenie so badly? As the spiritual leader of her people, the living Force inside the Queen must be very powerful. Whoever the Great Mother is, she wants that power. Well, wesa not let them have Queenie's Force. No, we will not. When we get to the temple, I'll handle the guards and whatever evil we find. You focus on the Queen. And wesa good guys will triumph. Right, Masteren Mace? Yes. Great Mother, my visions have come to fruition. At last, you are here. You may rise. Do you have the living sphere? I can feel the power of the pure spirit resonating in this orb. The Jedi comes. This temple is well protected. When they arrive, the stone guardians will deal with them. We must begin the ritual at once. Come. Who are you? The hour is far too late to trouble yourself with such matters, my dear. It may help you to know, however, that I am not a natural Force wielder like the Jedi or Sith. I use dark magic to achieve power. But as a Bardottan, you posses a strong connection to the living Force, a connection that will now be mine. Never. I will not succumb to your evil. How noble. Upon that tower rests a device that can harness the energy of the sun. When the lenses are aligned, the energy will rip your spirit from you, and I will gather it here. With the combined power of your spirit and my dark magic, I will become more powerful than any Sith or Jedi. I see the Queen. The ritual has started. Let's go. Oh, boy. Masteren Mace! Masteren Mace! Oh, nosa! Demons! Get behind me. Mesa needen some help back here! Whoa! Whoa! Whoasa! Whoasa! Jar Jar, are you okay? Look, mesa found a bang booma gun. Nice work. The Jedi have defeated the stone guardians. You mean the Jedi and the Gungan. Jar Jar! Mesa here, Queenie. Master Windu. I assume you are the Great Mother. No, I am a simple witch, not worth the trouble or attention of the great Jedi Order. A Nightsister. Get the Queen. Oh, boy! Your power is no match for my magicks. Magic is only an illusion. Hurry, Jar Jar. Oh! Let go. Jar Jar. I knew you would save me. Mesa never let anything happen to you, Queenie. Jar Jar, your highness, over here. I saw the witch when I looked into the Force. Jar Jar, I wanted to tell you. I knew you would stop her. You should be thanking Masteren Mace. Jedi Master, I owe you my life. It is my privilege to serve you, Queen Julia. Perhaps this is a new beginning for the Bardottans and the Jedi. Perhaps. Hee-wah!

Boba Fett, son of the notorious bounty hunter Jango Fett, infiltrated a Jedi cruiser in an attempt to assassinate general Mace Windu, the man who killed his father. After a near miss at Windu's quarters, Boba was forced to destroy the Jedi cruiser and escape with the help of notorious bounty hunter Aurra Sing. Now, having lost contact with Admiral Kilian when his doomed starship crashed, the Jedi search for survivors with the aid of a Republic rescue ship. General Windu, we're picking up the last of the survivors now. It's critical to get them to a hospital station as soon as possible. We'll contact you as soon as our search for Admiral Kilian is complete. [R2-D2 beeping] Let's go, Artoo. We're coming up on the crash site. Let's hope Admiral Kilian and the command crew are still in one piece. [R2-D2 beeping] Hmm, looks pretty bad, but the bridge seems to be intact. Set down behind the cruiser. We'll approach on foot. [R2-D2 beeping] [R2-D2 beeping] Huh! You're not kidding, little buddy. I don't like the feel of this place either. Your astromech is programmed to feel? Artoo is kind of a He's got a lot of personality, that's all. You encourage it too much. [R2-D2 beeping] R8, start scanning the area for signs of life. And calculate an entry point to the cruiser. [R8 beeps] [R2-D2 beeping] You're right, Artoo. It doesn't look good. [Creatures growling] [R2-D2 beeping excitedly] A bit jittery, isn't it? He must have seen something. [R2-D2 beeping] Come on. It looks like r8 has found an entry point. There would have been a command crew left aboard to try and land this ship, Admiral Kilian and then at least three navigational officers. Commander ponds stayed as well. [R2-D2 beeping] What did you find, little guy? [R2-D2 beeping] Mace, over here! Hmm. This man did not die in the crash. He was executed. There's another one over here. Same thing. We know the assassins were after me. Perhaps they returned to look for my body. We need to get to the bridge to find Admiral Kilian. Send the droids to scan for any survivors down here. Maybe the killer missed one. I know there's a lot of interference, but do your best. Skywalker! [Droids beeping] [R2-D2 beeping excitedly] [Electricity crackling] They're dead, executed like the troopers below. But I don't see Admiral Kilian or commander ponds. They must have been sucked into space when the cabin lost pressure. Captain, there's no sign of any life down here. I'm afraid Admiral Kilian and commander ponds are lost. Take the survivors back to the hospital station. We'll meet you there. Mace out. Captain silver out. Head for home. Lightspeed. [Dramatic music]   [flames crackling] [Vehement beeping] [Creature roars] [Panicked beeping] [Electricity crackling] Is that a mandalorian helmet? [Creatures growling] What is that doing here? Clone cadets. Jango Fett. Boba! Anakin, no! [Beeping] Drop it! [Explosion] [R2-D2 beeping] [Dramatic music]   mace is dead. Are you happy now? I want to make sure he's dead. There's nothing left of Windu to find, Boba. I want to get off this planet now. This place is crawling with Gundarks, and besides, we got these hostages to drag along with us now. This extra baggage will fetch us a hefty sum from the separatists. Well, it's a lot of trouble for not enough payout, if you ask me. You haven't even done anything! I've taken all the risks. Quiet, runt. Oh! I wouldn't do that. Count Dooku will pay us well if we bring back the Jedi's head. Dooku might pay us for killing Windu. Then we're looking at a profit. Uh, well Now, relax. Boba is right. To get paid, we need proof of Windu's death. And if we killed Skywalker, we can ask for double. Double? Yes. But we need proof. Bossk, take care of our \"guests\" while we're gone. [R2-D2 whirring and beeping] Artoo! [Grunts] Over here. Good to see you, buddy. [Coughs] Careful, Artoo. I'm afraid the whole bridge will collapse. The temple for help, okay? [Coughs] Okay? [R2-D2 whimpers] Go get help. We'll hold out as long as we can. Go on, Artoo. [Weakly] Go on. [Sniffs] Come on. We've got to find Windu's body. Careful, Boba. Yeah, careful. Three ways. [Grumbles] Look out! Oh! This place is a death trap. When I hired you, I didn't realize that you were such a coward. Well, I don't want to be next. Blast! The door must have malfunctioned. [R2-D2 chuckles] [Groans] Skywalker. Skywalker, are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Except I can't move. Can you get free? [Groans] I already tried that. You'll bring the whole place down on us! Well, how do we plan on getting ourselves out of this mess? Don't worry. I already sent Artoo back to the fighters to call for help. I'm sure he has everything under control. Hmm. I'm just saying, I didn't know there'd be all this climbing involved. Shut up already! It wasn't my idea for you to tag along anyway. The next one who says anything will get a blaster bolt through the brain. But, Aurra-- not one more word. [R2-D2 singing happily] Incoming! What was that? The ship is falling apart around us. Oh, this is no good. If we can barely survive in here, Windu must have been killed in the blast. I'm not quitting now, not when I'm so close. [Clattering] Look out! [Explosion] We're running out of time. [Grunts] That's it. We're out of here. A Jedi could. I hate to agree with Castas, but there's a better way to do this. But, Aurra-- bossk, fire up slave I. We're going to blast what's left of this ship to pieces. I'll be ready when you arrive. Ugh! I hate just sitting here. Calm yourself, Skywalker. We'll soon see if the faith is worth it. [R2-D2 beeping] [Gundark shrieking] [R2-D2 beeping] Twang! What was that? [Hisses] Scanners picked up an explosion near where the Jedi landed. Windu! Jam any communications off this planet. The fighter's markings match Windu's. I knew it! I told you he wasn't dead. Bossk! After him. [Blaster firing] I don't like the sound of that. [Rumbling] Artoo? I thought your astromech was supposed to call for help, not take off and leave us here. [Dramatic music]   come on, Artoo. I'm counting on you. [Blaster firing] [R2-D2 beeping] Hold it steady! You've knocked out his communications. [Rhythmic beeping] Two rings, mark three five. They're powering up. If we can take out the rings, he'll be trapped. Which one? Destroy them both. We can't get range. You'll get one shot at this, kid. I've got you, Windu. No! Well, there goes a fortune. Nice work, kid. What's our next move? Great! Well, this has gone well. Windu will be back here with a fleet. He'll hunt us down. Don't count on it. The Jedi don't carry grudges. But I have ways of Motivating him. We'll make Windu come to us next time, on our terms. Now, let's get out of here. I want to regroup. [R2-D2 beeping] We shall reinforce our fleet along the Hydian way. This should prevent grievous from-- [R2-D2 beeping] Artoo? [R2-D2 beeping] Stop it! Artoo, what's wrong? Ahsoka, you know this droid? It's Anakin's droid, R2-D2. Well, then, Artoo, deliver the message you so obviously need to communicate. I need you to go back to the fighters and call the temple for help, okay? [Coughs] Okay? Prepare my ship. We shall leave immediately. [Explosions] Whose helmet is that, anyway? It belongs to a bounty hunter I killed on geonosis by the name of Jango Fett. You mean the clone template? Yes. Strangely enough, he had a son-- or at least a clone he regarded as a son. His name is Boba Fett. I remember now. Obi-Wan listed him in his report on kamino. Boba was on geonosis when his father died. He watched as I killed him. That would complicate things. Indeed. [Coughing] Your astromech has been gone too long. He must have failed to deliver your message. Artoo will come through. There, in the bridge! I can see them. [R2-D2 beeping] Ahsoka, hold the ship steady. Comet, let's go! Hurry, commander Wolffe. Hold tight, general. We're losing it, sir. Jump! Cut the lines. Go! But nothing a night in the bacta tank won't fix. [Grunts] Oh, sorry. We were lucky to arrive when we did. Guess we have Artoo to thank for that. [R2-D2 beeps] Come here, droid. [R2-D2 whirring] I can see why your master trusts you, little one. Good job. [R2-D2 beeping] Ha! That's definitely more praise than I ever get. Hmm. This isn't what I wanted. You don't have to do this. You're not like them. I can tell. What do you know, old man? I know a good soldier when I see one. I'm no soldier. I'm no clone, not like those two. What? What are you looking at? Boba, what's going on? Nothing. What are we gonna do with them? Oh, I think our friends here are about to finally prove useful. [Chuckles] Slap! [Grunting and yelping] [Engine whooshing] So what are you planning to do with this son of Jango Fett? I'm not planning to do anything. That kid destroyed an entire cruiser trying to get to you, and you're just gonna let it go? Is there something else I should be doing, Skywalker? How about tracking him down? So I should behave as this child does? I should seek revenge. No. How is it revenge if you stop this kid and bring him to justice? In case you hadn't noticed, we are fighting a war. We have a situation. We received a transmission from the bounty hunters. They apparently took hostages. Mace Windu, you were lucky to escape. Your friends here were not so fortunate. Until you face Boba, these men will be killed one at a time. What's your name? Name! Ct-411. Ugh, pathetic. Boba, do it. Boba! [Blaster fires] Only two to go, Windu. Come and find us. We'll be waiting. I'll go. I thought you had bigger concerns. That was before we knew hostages were involved. You are too injured to travel, and your presence would only aggravate the boy. I shall go and take Padawan Tano with me. [Engine whirring] Next time I tell you to pull the trigger, you do it. It should only be a matter of time until they track us down. Something on your mind, Castas? Yeah, I got something to say. We're in over our heads. You signed on to kill Jedi. Well, this is how it's done. You said the separatists would pay well if we killed Windu. That kid destroyed an entire cruiser, and now we're taking hostages. That was not part of the plan. I never took you for a coward, Castas. And what about you, bossk? You feel the same? I'm still in. I got a lot riding on this kill, and I need the cash. Not me. I'm out. Well, then you're in luck. I was planning on making a stop. You can drag your worthless carcass off of this ship when we land. Where are we headed? We're going to visit an old friend. Maybe he can replace Castas. Set course for Florrum. [Engine whirring] [Engines whooshing] Master PLO, I don't understand. Shouldn't we be heading for the last place we knew Boba Fett was spotted? Why head to the one place we know he is not? [Engine whirring] Whoa. The second bounty hunter in the hologram is Aurra Sing. Another bounty hunter. Like his father, Jango Fett. Yes. It seems this boy found himself in the care of at least one of Jango's associates. So we're looking for friends of Jango Fett or places where they hang out. And to do that, we must go to the lower levels, the underworld. Move along. Move along. Move along. Move along. Your pass, please. Your pass, please. Your pass, please. Your pass, please. Your pass, please. The data on Jango Fett suggested he frequented this area. We must be cautious. [Engine whooshing] [Barking] Come on, punch him! Yeah, get him! [Distant shouting and cheering] Oh, my dear. You never were good at asking I never ask for permission to do anything, my darling. Yes. Yes. [Chuckles] I remember. Not mine, I take it? No. Part of my crew. He's Jango's son. Oh. Yes, yes. Sorry about your father. He was a friend and an honorable man. And that's Castas. But he's getting off here. Couldn't handle her, could you? Well, don't be ashamed. You're not the first man to bail out from under her command. He's speaking from experience. Whoa-ho-ho. Oh, you're a dangerous woman. Yes, very dangerous. Come, come, come. Let us go inside where we can discuss business over a drink like civilized people. [Screaming and jostling] [Exotic hip-hop music]   [plinking] I'm stuck out here on Florrum. I warned you. Working with Aurra Sing is bad business. Yeah, this job's gone South, like every job I do with that hag.   No, Boba. I hear there's a downed Republic cruiser on Vanqor. Your handiwork? I wouldn't take credit for that. No. We saw it, though, crawling with Republic troops. I wouldn't try and salvage it for a while if I were you. I appreciate the advice. So, Boba, what is it like working with Aurra? It's all right. [Comlink crackles] I have some information-- information that's worth something to the right people. Really? What kind of people? That's where you come in. Remember, Aurra, that job we pulled? Hmm? Oh, yes. Excuse me. Castas! Huh? [Blaster fires] [Screams] [Sizzling] [Laughter] Hey, hey. Someone scrape that guy off the floor. He sprung a leak. [Engine whirring] Well, I hope we have better luck here. This is the fifth scum bucket drinking hole we've been to. Yes. And this time, try to be more subtle. Oh, what do you mean? You've adopted many of your master's ways, including lack of subtlety. Sorry, master PLO. Just try to blend in. Listen. You may be surprised what people reveal when they have been drinking. [Throbbing dance music]   [all speaking indistinctly] Have a look around.   [indistinct speech] I need some information. We're not selling that here, pal. Clunk! Hmm. Been a while since we had one of you down here. Aren't you a bit busy with your war to be bothering with the likes of us? We are never too busy for the citizens of the Republic.   [groans] I'm not getting anywhere. Okay, try to relax. [Sighs] I'm listening, listening. This war is killing me. My whole business has gone under. Oh, get me another round. [Indistinct speech] I saw her last night on the video screen. [Indistinct speech] I'm gonna ask her out. She'll never go out with you. She's gonna go out with me. Florrum? A buddy of mine was just murdered on Florrum. Murdered?   uh, yeah, he was working a big job. At least that is what he said. He was telling me he had some valuable information on a holotransmitter. And then--boom! She shot him. It must have been some good dirt. What's her name? Hope it's not who I think it is. He was working with Aurra Sing. She's bad news. Ah, that's her, all right. She's the boss' ex. There's always trouble when she shows up. Yeah, that's the one. [Gasps] Find something interesting, kid? [Both grunt] Hey, what's this? What are you reaching for? [Blasters clicking] [Lightsaber hums] Stand down. You can't take us all, Jedi. Would you like to try and prove your theory? Hey, nobody's shooting up my place today. He's right. [Coins jingle] Drinks on the house. [Jingling] [Clattering] [Indistinct chatter] Not very subtle. Well, I was being subtle. Interesting result. But, master, you were right. I heard about a murder-- a murder Aurra Sing recently committed. Florrum. Well done, little 'Soka. We're off to Florrum. Well, my dear, you are in an interesting predicament once again. [Chuckles] Getting involved with the Jedi is never a good idea. Aurra. We've got an incoming ship. Jedi, by the look of it. Windu. Finally. Took them long enough. Move slave I to the outskirts and get the hostages ready. Right. So are you in or not? I will not help you, but I will not hinder you either. This is your fight, not mine. [Engine whirring] [Engine whooshing] [Clinking and chiming] Hello, hello, and welcome to Florrum. I should assume you are walking us into a trap. Yes, you should. They're waiting inside the bar. I have no idea what she has planned for you. And the reason you are telling us is? Involved in this. Remember, patience. Bad move, Jedi. This will cost you. I wanted Windu. What are you doing here? We can do this the difficult way or the simple way. The choice is yours. Bossk. Can you hear me? Roger. Execute the hostages if I give the word. Unwise. You have already lost, and you don't even know it. I am prepared to kill you, the hostages, whatever it takes to get what Boba wants. Sounds more like what you want. [Lightsaber hums] Clang! Don't. Aurra. Aurra. Bad news, boys. If I don't hear from her soon, I'm gone, and you're both fried. Let her go. No chance. She won't do it, Boba. She's not like you. She's right. I'm not a murderer. I'm not a murderer. But I want justice. We are justice. Don't listen to them. No one will be harmed if you come quietly. I can't let you die. You won't have to. Click! Aurra! [Blaster fires] Smack! Thunk! [Blasters firing] [Lightsaber hums] It's over. Surrender. Aurra, now! [Beeping] Bomb! [Explosion] Boba, hurry. Aurra, help! Help me! Don't leave me! No! The hostages, where are they? Boba, if you do not tell us where those men are, they are going to die, innocent men. She left me. Smack! [Grunts] [Groans] [Engine rumbles] [Engine rumbles] He will not reveal the location of the hostages. I thought you might talk some sense into him. Tell the Jedi what he wants to know, Boba. Why should I help anybody? I've got no one. It is the honorable thing to do. It's what your father would have wanted. [Engines roaring] Ahsoka, she is trying to lead you away from the hostages. Go to coordinates 1579. Time's up. [Blasters firing] [Lightsaber hums] Don't move. [Engine roars] [Explosion] [Engine whirring] Ahh! Ah! [Lightsaber hums] [Metallic groaning] [Beeping] [Engine whirring] [Lightsaber hums] [Blaster firing] [Glass shatters] No! Come on! [Engine whining] [Explosion] I see now I've done terrible things, but you started it when you murdered my father. I'll never forgive you. Hmm. Well, you're going to have to. Take him away.   \n                "}, "Hostage Crisis": {"episode": "s01e22", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tEpisode Air No.: 22 Production No.: Season 2; Episode 4 Hostage Crisis Written by Eoghan Mahony Supervising Writer: Drew Z. Greenberg Staff Writer: Brian Larsen Directed by Giancarlo Volpe \u00a1\u00a1 Danger looms! Despite recent victories in the Outer Rim, criminal minds plot at the very heart of the Republic! The bounty hunter Cad Bane has assembled some of the deadliest criminals in the galaxy and plans a daring attack to seize members of the Senate. What can be the aim of this despicable act? Here we go. \"Attention, attention. \"This is a restricted area. \"No landing is permitted without permission. \"Violators will be prosecuted to the full extend of the law.\" Put up your hands. I've got business with the Senate. How about you fall a step aside? On your knees. Raise your hands, slowly. Son, I wouldn't be so hasty if I were you. Cuff him. Where's that coming from?! I see the shooter up in the tower. - Over there. - Aah! You two, get these uniforms on and get this platform clear. \"Base to platform, what was all that? Report.\" Protesters against the war, we've taken care of them. Finish getting those uniforms on and clear this platform now. Everybody else, follow me. Hey, I'm supposed to be on a meditative retreat. We should go away together. I know a place far from here where no one would recognise us. Yeah, it would be like we're actually husband and wife, instead of Senator and Jedi. I I can't, Annie. What do you mean you can't? It's only two weeks, we'll be back before anyone even notices we're gone. I have to bring this bill before the Senate. It's important. More important than the way you feel about me? Not more important, but important. The work I do, the work we both do, is in service to the Republic. To protect those who would otherwise be powerless to protect themselves. Of course, but those are ideals. Isn't our love more important to you? - But I - No, no \"but\". To me there's nothing more important than the way I feel about you. Nothing. Anakin, don't be so -- - You don't believe me. - I didn't say -- I'll prove it. Just watch. When I finished constructing my lightsaber, Obi-Wan said to me \"Anakin, this weapon is your life.\" This weapon is my life. No, Anakin, I can't. A Jedi lightsaber is Wow, it's heavy than I thought. It's yours. Believe me now? If all you want to do is make fun of me, - I think you should just go. - That's not what I want. Not at all. Stop! You know what to do. I'll figure it out. You better not fail me, bubble brain. Don't worry, I'll have the power out in no time. The rest of you come with me. - But Senator Organa, it just wouldn't be - Quick, hide! The situation cannot be delayed. Now stand aside. I apologise for my abruptness. Oh, Senator Organa, how good to see you. What is it? Senator Filo has called a meeting in the lobby before we vote on the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill. Right, Privacy Invasion Bill. We must hurry if we are to stop the vote. Coming, Senator Amidala? Of course. Quietly Guard change happens now. Here we go. Now let's go talk to some Senators. Help me. No! Aah! We can not allow the Chancellor to move this Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill forward. We are all in agreement then. Morning, Senators. You should all consider yourselves to be in my power. As long as everybody behaves this will be quick and painless. Do nothing and it will al be over soon. I don't know who you think you are, but I for one have no intention of listening to this kind of insolence. All right then. If you all gather at the centre of this lovely atrium my co-workers and I will relieve you of any communication devices. I see five of them here in the room. - If we -- - What are you going to do? It's not like we carry weapons. Chancellor Palpatine. What is it, Senator Orn Free Taa? I think you should see this. Sorry to bother you, Chancellor, but I've taken control of the east wing of your Senate building. The occupants are now my hostages. If you care about them, I'd advise you to free Ziro the Hutt from the detention centre. You should know that the Republic does not take kindly to such threats. If you have attempted such a fool-hardy action as to kidnap a Senator, I assure you it will be met with appropriate force. This ought to do it. What's going on? I'm in control. I make the rules now. Orn Free Taa, help me with this door. It's no use, sir. Someone's gotten into the central control panel. They've triggered the security system. The Senate buildings have sealed themselves. This is Chancellor Palpatine, there is an emergency at the Senate Building. Jedi Council, come in. Is anyone there? That's no use either, sir. They've cut off all communication with the outside. Hand over your communication devices please. I can't let them search me. What? Why not? I have something they must not find. What is it? Well, hello there little lady. And who might you be? I am Padme Amidala. Senator from Naboo. And I demand that you release us immediately. The Galactic Senate will not treat with with terrorists. Ain't you awful young and pretty to be a senator? Skywalker?! After him! Hello, come in. Anyone there? This is General Skywalker, Chancellor Palpatine, can you hear me? My dear boy, I'm glad to know you're there and all right. What is going on down there? I hear it too. Coming from up ahead. \"They've sealed the entire building. \"Nobody can get in. And we can not get out.\" It's up to you. You have to get to the power control room and turn off the security seal. You have two more floors to check. Come on. We've got two more floors to check. You take downstairs, I'll go up. We'll meet on the other side. No lightsaber cuts. Interesting. What happened? Where's the droid? The droid's gone, but there's good news. The Jedi's unarmed. What? It doesn't look like he has his lightsaber. Go, bring him back to me. Woopsie! Hurry, hurry, hurry. - The lightsaber, I've got it. - What? Why do you have a Jedi's lightsaber? The question is whether we should try and get it back to Ana the Jedi Knight. Or use it ourselves. Everybody quiet. I've got a call to make. So here's what you're going to do. First you're going to make a pardon disc, you can give it to your friend there. Hmm, me? My ship will come and pick him up and take him to the prison. Once Ziro has been released and is handed to me, then your associates will be released. Understand? Oh, I do. But I feel it is my duty to warn you that you will end up paying for this outrage. I can live with that. Come on, open the door. I won't hurt you. Well, well What have we here? Blast it! Tie your little pet up. We'll bring him to Bane. Here's the pardon disc. Let's go. Why do I have to go to the jail for this? Move it. Sorry, Senator. But everyone has a job to do. Hurry up. Young Skywalker. Not so impressive without your lightsaber, are you, Jedi? Toss him in with the others. Arriving at the prison now. Unlock the doors. Oh, it's so bright out here! Why couldn't they do this at night when it's cooler? Go and get the parting gifts. Oh, look at Senator Orn Free Taa, he looks so unhappy. Now get me as far away from Coruscant as possible, now! Well, Mr Chancellor, thanks to your calm leadership, the crisis has passed. I got what I want, so I'll return your Senate and your Senators. Enjoy them, but don't try anything until the sun has set. Understand? We are to rendezvous back at the Senate building. What?! No, no, no, no! The Outer Rim, not the Senate, you stupid machine! I don't want to go to the Senate! We need to get to the landing platform. - Is everything ready? - Yep, yep. Turn on the field. If you so much as breath on one of these lasers, the whole room will blow up. Senators, Jedi, I bid you all the most respectful farewell. Let's go. All clear! Sir, are you all right? Yes, yes, I'm fine. Mission accomplished, sir. The Chancellor is safe. Well done, trooper. You were foolish to think you could get away with this, bounty hunter? Now lay down your arms and come quietly. No, Chancellor. I am afraid it is you who have been foolish with your Senators' lives. One false move and the east wing of the Senate Building goes up in smoke. Please, Annie, wake up. You win, bounty hunter. Holster! Stand down. What are you looking so sad about? The bounty hunter said we should just sit here. I think we should just sit here. Well, that's not a very good idea. Come on. Let's get going. Too bad I don't have my lightsaber. You mean this? I found it where you dropped it. Now, quickly, we don't have much time. Well, Hutt, it doesn't look like prison had too adverse an effect on you. Ooh, you can't imagine the unspeakable things I've suffered! The horror! I doubt I'll ever really recover! How about some dead Senators as pay back? Another daring rescue, Master Jedi. I do my best, Senator. Congratulations on a job well done, bounty hunter. Time to pay up, Hutt. I don't work for free. Subtitle made by: Let's get going.

Darth Maul and Savage Opress command the planet Mandalore through the puppet Prime Minister Almec while they expand their criminal enterprise. With the Death Watch removed from power and the Jedi unaware of the villainous plot, nothing stands in the way of Darth Maul's vision for a vast criminal empire. We now find Duchess Satine imprisoned as her few remaining loyal subjects make a desperate attempt to rescue her. What do you want, you traitor? I would never betray you, Auntie Satine. I'm here to rescue you. Korkie. Freeze! Hold it there. Death Watch. Bo. It's been a long time. It's okay, Auntie. She's on our side now. Why are you helping now? The enemy of my enemy is my friend. There was a time when we weren't enemies. Perhaps that time has come again. Come on. Let's go. It's all clear. Come on. We need to contact the Jedi Council. Korkie, give me your comlink. It won't be any good unless we get outside the city. All of the frequencies are jammed. You are all taking a terrible risk by helping me. Nothing we haven't done before. Right, Auntie? Let's get going. Take 'em out. Get the duchess clear. The transmission is still blocked. You're clear. This is a message for Obi-Wan Kenobi. I've lost Mandalore. My people have been massacred. I need your help. You summoned me, Masters? This is a message for Obi-Wan Kenobi. I've lost Mandalore. My people have been massacred, and Almec is now the prime minister. I can't explain everything now but Almec has the support of the crime families. I need your help. Your thoughts on this, Master Kenobi. Satine has been at odds with the Death Watch for years. And according to a report from Padawan Tano, they're no longer in league with the Separatists. If there was a takeover on Mandalore, it was most likely an independent act caused by the Death Watch alone. Without involvement from the Separatists, this is an internal affair for the Mandalorians. I'm afraid we cannot help. We cannot just hand Mandalore over to these crime families and let Satine become a martyr. I'm afraid her decision to keep Mandalore neutral makes this situation difficult. Understand your feelings I do. But to take action, support from the Republic Senate we will need. You know what the Senate will decide. They will not send aid to a neutral system. At this time, nothing more can we do. Satine's accomplices have escaped, including the renegade Death Watch soldiers. But we will find them. The duchess appears to have contacted the Jedi just as anticipated. Good. You have done well. What of the people? You are the legitimate prime minister. Mandalore is a sovereign planet and you will maintain its neutrality. And what of the Jedi? Because of Mandalore's neutrality, the Jedi have no jurisdiction here. If Kenobi comes to rescue his friend, he will have to come alone. Anakin, that's the last time I borrow a ship from you. You better get your ship looked at. It's my friend's ship. He told me it was perfectly fine. - Terribly sorry about that. - Do you have a landing permit? I think I left it in the ship. Come with me, and I'll get it. Here to do more of your master's bidding? I do my own bidding. Are you alone? Yes. The Jedi Council and Galactic Senate will be of no help to us here. I trust you have an escape plan then? As always, my dear. There's no record of a prisoner transfer here. The orders came from upstairs. What's the authorization code? Hey, you! Stop! It's the duchess. She's getting away. We have to contact my sister for help. She'll send reinforcements. Who's your sister? Brace yourself! Let's get out of here. No. It can't be. We meet again, Kenobi. Welcome to my world. Take them back to the palace. Your noble flaw is a weakness shared by you and your duchess. You should have chosen the dark side, Master Jedi. Your emotions betray you. Your fear, and yes, your anger. Let your anger deepen your hatred. Don't listen to him, Obi Quiet. You can kill me, but you will never destroy me. It takes strength to resist the dark side. Only the weak embrace it. It is more powerful than you know. And those who oppose it are more powerful than you'll ever be. I know where you're from. I've been to your village. I know the decision to join the dark side wasn't yours. - The Nightsisters made it for you. - Silence! You think you know me? It was I who languished for years thinking of nothing but you. Nothing but this moment. And now the perfect tool for my vengeance is in front of us. I never planned on killing you. But I will make you share my pain. Remember, my dear Obi-Wan I've loved you always. I always will. Do we kill him now, brother? No. Imprison him below. Let him drown in his misery. Take him to his cell to rot. You summoned me, Chancellor? Prepare my ship. It's the rebels! Sorry, I don't believe we've met. You are? Bo-Katan. I'm here to rescue you. That's all you need to know. Sounds good to me. You ever use one of these before? No, but in this case, I'm a fast learner. Let's go. Halt! Maul must really want you dead. You have no idea. I sense a presence. A presence I haven't felt since Master. Master. I am most impressed to see you have survived your injuries. I used your training, Master. And I have built all this in hopes of returning to your side. How unfortunate that you are attempting to deceive me. Master? You have become a rival! Go back to your Republic and tell them what has happened. That would likely lead to a Republic invasion of Mandalore. Yes, and Maul will die. But Mandalore will survive. We always survive. Now go. Your Satine's sister, aren't you? I'm so sorry. Brother. Brother, I am an unworthy apprentice. I'm not like you. I never was. Remember, the first and only reality of the Sith, there can only be two. And you are no longer my apprentice. You have been replaced. Have mercy. Please. Please! There is no mercy. Do not worry. I'm not going to kill you. I have other uses for you.   \n                "}, "The Lair of General Grievous": {"episode": "s01e10", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tViceroy Gunray escapes. En route to Coruscant to stand trial for war crimes, evil separatist leader Nute Gunray has broken free of his Jedi escort. With the help of Count Dooku's sinister agents, the villainous Viceroy has made a daring getaway. Alerted to the bold prison break, Jedi Master Kit Fisto has traced the stolen ship to a remote system, hoping to recapture Gunray and return him to justice. I know we're in the middle of nowhere, R6, but that's the Republic beacon we're looking for. Contact the Outer Rim command. Master Luminara, I have tracked the location of our stolen ship to the Vassek system. So has your old Padawan, Nahdar Vebb. He's already on the surface. It'll be great to see Nahdar again. I'll transmit the coordinates for the rendezvous point. And Master Fisto, sorry we lost that slimy double-dealer. Don't worry, Ahsoka, we'll catch Gunray yet. Good hunting. Well, I can't see anything either. You'll be fine, R6. Just keep a lookout for me, okay? Nahdar! Congratulations on passing the trials. I'm sorry the war prevented me from seeing your training through to the end. You were missed, Master, but it is an honor to finally serve beside you as a knight. General, we've pinpointed the tracking beacon's location to the south end of the gorge. Then let's have a look. Allow me to show the way. Charming. Let's not keep the Viceroy waiting. Niner, Bel, look after the ships. Yes, sir! No guards? - That's odd. - The entrance looks sealed. We specialize in making entrances. This will make less noise. Patience, the both of you. A second look usually pays off. What's this? I sense there's something here. Scanners are negative, General. Well, that was something. All droids stay on guard. - Be ready for anything. - Roger, roger. Double shifts for everyone! Viceroy? You must protect me at all costs. Viceroy, the Jedi are here. I know they're near. Once those Jedi pick up my trail, they never leave me alone. They're right behind you. What? Where? Do something. You! Blast them! I didn't forget to teach you restraint, did I, my old Padawan? I am sorry, Master. I got carried away. Those who have power should restrain themselves from using it. Lieutenant, did you get them? No, but we have you, Viceroy. You have nothing, Jedi fools. I welcome you to your doom. The tracking beacon. They knew we were coming. I should have known Gunray wasn't here. At the first sight of us, he would have run off screaming like the coward he is. I apologize for the deception, Master Jedi. Count Dooku. You have a great talent for unexpected appearances. It's a shame you came so far to be frustrated. While the Viceroy is unavailable for capture, allow me to offer you an alternative prize. This has got to be a trap. It looks like Dooku is trying to catch someone, and we're the bait. But who has the trap been set to catch? Shall we find out? This place looks like a shrine to that strange warrior. This is the lair of General Grievous. Yes, my Lord? General, the ongoing stalemate in the war has become unacceptable. There is concern you have lost your focus. Lord Sidious demands more dramatic results, more dead Jedi. You expect victory over Jedi, but all you give me to fight them is battle droids. These must be trophies taken from the Jedi he's murdered. There are so many. Why would Dooku want to set a trap for his best General? It doesn't make sense. Are we the bait, or is Grievous the bait? We must consider who this trap is for. General, your droid is tracking an incoming ship. It matches a description of General Grievous' fighter. It's headed our way. Keep out of sight and stand by for further orders. Capturing Grievous could turn the tide of the war. And if he doesn't know we're here, we could take him down easy. Don't underestimate him. We'll need a plan. Guards? Gore? Gore, where are you? Welcome home, General. I'm afraid I must request your surrender. Cooperate, Grievous, and perhaps the senate will be merciful. It is you who shall get no mercy. Cables! Don't let him go! We got him! Don't let him cut the lines! Hold him! Don't make me destroy you. Come and get me. Cut him off! Where'd he go? The clones got in the way. I could have taken him. Let's take care of our wounded. Doctor, where are you? Don't be upset with me, Master. If you were a better fighter, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Look what you let those Jedi do to you. You're a walking scrap pile. What a mess. It's going to take me forever to get you back into decent shape. I'll go fetch your spare parts. What happened to my bodyguards? They were remotely deactivated for recharge. I thought you did it. Lock down the perimeter. Let me go after Grievous myself, Master. Patience, Nahdar. You may no longer be a Padawan, but you are not ready to take on Grievous. It's time we retreated. You are not going anywhere. It looks like we're going to have to fight after all. Green scout to watcher base. Copy. This is watcher base, over. Contact the fleet at Besteene. Inform them we've engaged Grievous and require reinforcements. Right away, sir. Better warm up the shuttle's long-range transmitter. Get out of there, R6, now! R6? You've run out of time. Why don't you come out? Show us some of that separatist hospitality. Patience. In the meantime, please experience all my home has to offer. It has been prepared for uninvited guests like you. General, I know you're watching. We've seen the lower levels of your home. We're not impressed. Good, Jedi, good. You will provide some sport for me yet. Gore, time to entertain our guests. Stand firm. There might be worse things here than Grievous. It looks like you're right about that, sir. Good-bye, Jedi. Master, the armor patches are getting cold, and contrary to your belief, I do have other things to do. Proceed with my repair. Sometimes I wonder why you submitted to the changes. Improvements. I submit to no one. I chose them. Now get on with it. There may be some discomfort. Shoot him, Commander! Grievous is going to pay for this. I will destroy him. I understand your pain, but you forget your teachings, Nahdar. Revenge is not the Jedi way. But in this war, strength prevails. The rules have changed. Perhaps you are the one who has changed. Come now, we need to keep moving. Let's see if Gore is finished playing with the Jedi. Where are they? Gore? You have an incoming transmission from Count Dooku. General, I understand the Jedi have infiltrated your lair. Your recent defeats at their hands have shaken my faith in your ability to lead the droid army. I'm sure you can understand my need to reassess your effectiveness. You! You deactivated my guards. You let the Jedi in here so you would test me. I do hope you emerge victorious. It's time for you to prove All right, Count. I'll play your little game. In your condition, you need your rest. I will rest when the Jedi are dead. You were right, Master. That exit must lead to the control room. What have we here? The uninvited guests. Let's go. Master, the Jedi are about to enter the control room. - Nahdar, inside, hurry! - No, you go. I will hold him off. There's no time to argue. We can't just run. We must finish him. Nahdar, hurry! I have been waiting for this. Greetings, young Jedi. - Where is your Master? - How exciting. You will find out soon enough. - You can't defeat us all. - Of course I can. Get him, Master. Kill him! Where's the other Jedi? I will kill you all. Do you hear me, Jedi? R6? Is that you? Meet me at the south landing platform. I'll be right there. I'm coming for you next, Fisto. I'll be gone by the time you get here. R6, I'm at the platform. Where are you? Going somewhere? You might have been a proud warrior once, but now, you're just a pawn in Dooku's game. I wield great power, Jedi fool. That power will only consume you. How quickly power can change hands. Surrender, and I promise you will die quickly. Stop him! Let's go home, R6. Count Dooku, the Jedi have been defeated. Victory over the clones and the young Jedi was expected, but to best a Jedi Master This is truly an accomplishment worthy of recognition. The Jedi Fisto escaped. So there is room for improvement. What about your former Padawan? His heart was in the right place, but he tried to answer Grievous' power with his own. To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not. In this war, a danger there is of losing who we are.   \n                "}, "Children of the Force": {"episode": "s02e03", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA thief hunted! In a daring assault, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka, boarded the warship of cunning bounty hunter Cad Bane to recover a stolen holocron containing a list of the galaxy's force-sensitive children and future Jedi knights. After a desperate chase and duel with the villain, Anakin and his troops defeated Bane but were forced to evacuate his doomed vessel without the holocron. How many made it off this time? Just us. Denal, good job frying that bounty hunter. - Let's get some grub. - You hungry? I'll catch up. So what now? We get the injured to the medical bay. General, there's something I think you should see. Trooper, are you all right? Must've been hit in the head. It's blood, sir. And it sure isn't from any of our men. Wait! You're injured. That might be serious. You're no clone. Admiral, lock down the hyperspace rings! Hurry! What could possibly have happened since I last spoke with you? It's Bane. Lock those rings now. - No, lock them all down. Hurry. - Deactivating hyperspace rings. We'll have to inform the Council. It is most unfortunate Bane was allowed to escape again. With access to the names and locations of the most force-sensitive children in the Republic. Inflict devastating damage on the Jedi Order he could. We've discovered Bane's working with the separatists. There are thousands of children on that list. Which will he go after first? Small chance there is, through the force, the Council may detect them. I have delivered what you wanted. The Jedi were no problem. Anything else I can help you with? I need test subjects. Choose four children and bring them to Mustafar. I will take care of them. Kidnapping innocent children? Seems like a small-time crime for the likes of you. Among the children of the Jedi, there are no innocents. Sure, sure. As long as I get paid, it makes no difference to me. A jungle world. Dome cities I see. Rodia it is. A house in Kay Tap Square. I see it too. There's an ocean planet, home to Nautolans, Glee Anselm? Glee Anselm I see not. I sense A place I've been to before. Waterfalls. Naboo. Jan-Gwa. A village, southern sector. Sense it strongly, I do. The Gungan child was screaming. The future you see, young Skywalker. To Naboo you must go. Cad Bane you will find. With you, take your Padawan. You are certain there is no child on Glee Anselm? Into the shadow of the dark side taken the child was. Shrouded is his fate from us. Great the loss is. But more children in danger there are. I shall leave for Rodia immediately. Find more younglings we will. Your son is strong with the force. He will make a fine Jedi. Master Ropal said the day would come for him to go to the Temple, but not for some time. Master Ropal was unaware of the danger your son is in. Jedi imposters have been roaming the galaxy, stealing the future younglings. For your son's protection, I'm going to have to take him now. He is my only child. Look into this. It will relax you. Let's hope we have arrived in time. If you're looking for my son, Jedi, he's not here. Where is he? Open the door. You'll never get him. - Where is the bounty hunter? - Bounty hunter? He was a Jedi. Jedi do not carry blasters. What have I done? General Skywalker, they told us you were coming. Has the Gungan family been notified? Captain Lunker here is in charge of the operation. He will take you to Jan-Gwa city. Let me take the lead, Master. I've got a score to settle. All right, go with the Gungan. I'll be there shortly. Don't move, sleemo. You weren't the child I was expecting to find. Obviously. You're quite clever, but naive. Looks like I win. I think I've earned the right to wear this again. Your daughter is safe now. Do you really believe that? We know you've taken at least two children. - Where are they? - Beyond your reach. - Who are you working for? - I work alone. It is only a matter of time before we locate the holocron. Make it easier on yourself. What are you going to do, Jedi, torture me? I think the fear of whoever you work for outweighs your fear of us. This conversation is over. We tore the ship apart. There's no sign of the holocron or the kids. Did you check the ship's navigation records? They were wiped clean before he landed on Naboo. We'll have to use the force to make him talk. I don't think Bane is that weak. Maybe if we all concentrated on his mind together. Using the force to compel a strong mind to cooperate is risky. There is a danger that his mind could be destroyed in the process. Do we have another choice? You will take us to the holocron. Jedi mind tricks don't work on me. You will take us to the holocron. Forget it. You will take us to the holocron. I won't. And you will take us now! I will take you. Get out of my head. Perhaps we should try again. I've had enough of that. I'll take you to the holocron. You'll get your children back. The chancellor wants a report on our progress. Tell him this is not Republic business. It's an internal Jedi affair. I'm sorry to disagree, but as long as the Jedi are acting as a military, we should report to the chancellor, even on internal matters such as this. Well, then, I guess you just volunteered to go. - Give the chancellor my regards. - Wait a minute. I agree. Report back here when you are finished. This could be a trap, Master. You sure you don't need us to go? Of course it's a trap, Skywalker. I will contact you when we find the children. What if they don't find those kids? They will, snips. Come on. The coordinates. The coordinates are cross 7RB71. That will take us into the far Outer Rim, neutral space. Do you want your holocron and your kids or not? Anakin, it is good to see you. Your Excellency. Excuse us, child. I understand you made an important arrest in the plot to destroy the Jedi. Do you think a simple bounty hunter could create such a plan? I believe someone else, someone much more powerful was behind this. I don't think it was Dooku. And have you any clues as to who it may be? Not yet, chancellor. Have patience, my boy. There, there, child. Soon you will cry no more. Master, subjects of this age rarely survive the slave conditioning procedure. And I'm afraid the risk is necessary. The natural talent these children possess is too great to be wasted by the Jedi. I foresee an army of force-talented spies in my service, trained in the dark side to peer into every corner of the galaxy from afar. And my enemies would be helpless against such vision. If the surgery fails, I will have lost nothing. We'll be fine, Cody. - Stay here and watch the ship. - Yes, sir. I'll keep the ship running. I do not sense any children nearby. Neither do I. Where are you keeping the children? The children are safe. But first, there is your precious holocron. Let me get it for you. No more of your tricks. Blast! You certainly stepped in it this time. So long, Jedi. Now what do we do? Well, the piloting systems are clean. - Check the landing gear? - Double-checked it. I have the feeling Master Windu and Obi-Wan could've used our help. I don't like being out of the action either, but somebody's got to do this job. And it always ends up being us. Bane picked up a lot of volcanic ash on his travels. What have you got, Artoo? Looks like Bane erased his navigation records, but not his fuel computer. So? If we cross the list of planets we know he visited with the distance he traveled We may be able to calculate where else he went. That's a new one. It's an old Jedi trick we use to track down smugglers. Okay, let's see. Glee Anselm, Rodia, Mustafar, - Naboo. - Wait. Mustafar? There were no children on Mustafar. It's a mining world, very remote. Probably stopped there to refuel. That explains the ash. But it was six systems out of his way. Maybe he met up with whoever he's working for. It's worth a look, isn't it? Anything to get out of this hangar. I've got the holocron. Anytime, Cody. We're coming up on Mustafar. Artoo, begin the landing cycle. A starship is approaching. It is not the bounty hunter. This was unexpected. Evacuate the children to my secondary facility. I'm afraid this installation is lost. We must destroy all the evidence. Turn off the gravity supports and let the building sink into the lava. - I beg your pardon, sir. - Just do as I say. You sure this is the right place? We're gonna find out. I sense something, Master, and I don't like it. It's the dark side, Ahsoka. This is the right place. Did you hear that? Yeah, I heard it. The question is, where are they? This way. All gravity supports off. Quick, the Jedi are coming. Turn out the lights. Hurry, hurry. We're too late. I can sense they're still here. Be careful of the younglings. I know! - The panel's fried. - Where's Artoo? Be quiet. It's okay. The base was completely destroyed, Master, and so was any clue who's behind this. Most unfortunate this is. And we still have Bane. He got away again? The important thing is that the children are safe and we've recovered the holocron. The list is intact, and there is no evidence it was copied. Still, the future of all Jedi uncertain is. Move forward cautiously we must.

On a peaceful relief mission to the planet Aleen, R2-D2 and C-3PO were caught up in an adventure beyond their comprehension. After finally resolving the crisis and being taken to Jedi Master Adi Gallia's cruiser, they now head home toward the safety of the Republic, hoping to avoid a Separatist attack. And Mistress Padm\u00c3\u00a9, you would not believe the adventures Artoo and I had on that troubled planet of Aleen. We have been in the most absurd situations. I could never compute. Well, I told you, Threepio, it's a big universe out there, beyond the few million planets you know. And obviously, for the most part, quite uncivilized. I hope never to end up on a mission of that nature again. Good. I need you here to supervise the senatorial banquet. It was pushed up and is only two days away. Oh, my! They've hit the main reactor, prepare to evacuate. Non-essential personnel evacuate immediately. Non-essential personnel evacuate immediately. Did you hear that? We've got to get out of here. It's General Grievous! Artoo, where are you going? We need to find an escape pod. All pilots to your stations. All flight crews, man your stations. Move to your stations! All flight crews, man your stations. R2-D2, get down from there at once. This is not an escape pod. Well, if there's nothing better, I suppose, it will just have to do. I'm sure I will live to Artoo, you should know I have total confidence in your skills as a pilot, provided you can avoid these star cruisers. Oh, my! Avoid them the other way! Artoo, do something! Get us out of here! They're right behind us! We've been hit! Ah! Right on target! Well done, Artoo. Oh, no! The reactor was hit, it's shutting down. We'll disintegrate for sure. Fixable? This scrap pile? Without the tools, this ship is utterly useless! I suppose, we could get out and have a look around. Oh, really. You see, not even a ladder. Utterly useless! Utterly! Look, look! Over there! - Intruders! - Oh! - Shiny! - It's shiny! Intruders! Did you hear that? Whoever you are, please note that my counterpart here is programmed in 47 schools of self-defense. There, I've frightened them off. Fear not, Artoo, just little creatures. Can't possibly damage us! Oh! Oh! Oh! Get the Big Hay-Zu. He'll know what to do. Really! May I say that this is no way to treat a friendly visitor to your planet. The Big Hay-Zu says there are no friendly visitors. This Hay-Zu doesn't sound very reasonable. We do what he says, whatever he says, for our own good. Your own good? He sends our children to fight his wars, the lucky ones. What does he do to the unlucky ones? So, you are the intruders? Intruders? Oh, hardly, Your Worshipful-ness! We are On this planet, things are what Hay-Zu says they are! Quiet, Artoo. What's this? Your friend challenges Big Hay-Zu's authority! Sir, my disagreeable friend here means no disrespect. We are just trying to get back to our home planet, but our ship is damaged. And I fear, repaired or not, that further travel in it might not result in our arrival there unscathed. That's the chance you'll have to take. Now get off my planet while I'm in a good mood, or I'll have you dismembered and sold for scrap. Free them! Ah, big talk for a small droid! Artoo, have your sensors frozen? I am not going to let you at him! In fact, I'm going to switch you off before you cause an intergalactic incident. Oh, my! You just killed him. Dead. He's dead. The Big Hay-Zu is dead. You must understand this was an accident, a terrible accident. He's dead! He's dead! The Big Hay-Zu is dead! He's dead! He's dead! The Big Hay-Zu is dead! Gold one, we have a proposition. We wish you not to leave, but for you to stay, as our new leader. A lot you know, you over-stuffed barrel of bolts. I could be a leader. I am honored by your consideration but you should choose a leader from among your own. None of us has killed Hay-Zu. None of us have earned the title. Terminating the big one does not anoint me leader. You must choose. Now, who are the three smartest, most intelligent, most understanding, most compassionate? You should choose a leader from among these three. Who thinks he should be leader? Yeah. - Oh, yeah. And this young lady? Yeah! Lastly, him. Yeah! Congratulations! You are now a democracy. - I got more votes than he did. - No, you didn't! - Sit down! It was me! It was me! - I got the most votes. - That is not true. - Ridiculous! No! No, it was me. I heartily agree. Is the ship ready? Then we'll just have to risk it, and leave them to build their happy democracy, on their own. I got the votes! Down with democracy! Yes, I'm reading the gauges. I have nothing to do but read gauges. Why? What do the gauges say? Running out of power? The ship and us, too! Oh, I knew we should never have left the Jedi cruiser. Another planet? According to the positional system coordinates, this is Balnab, a stellar remnant in its emerging stages of organic development. I've heard terrible stories about these primitive planets. I dare not imagine what is beginning to swim in their primordial soups. I know we have to find power. But do we have to find it out there? Afraid? Of course I'm not afraid. I am now. Quickly, see if your scanners can find a viable power source. Yes, me, too. Life forms? What kind? They appear to be humanoid and completely devoid of intelligence. Artoo, make a dash for it! What are they? Bring them. The leader will know. Another leader? Oh! I do hope this one is more understanding. My fault! Ha! I should have known. Who dares come to my land? Just two wandering droids searching to find their home! Droids? What are droids? Well, kind sir, droids are mechanical beings possessing artificial intelligence, designed to make - Silence! - At once, sir. Your Sir-ness, being silent is one of my specialties. Who dares to bring these non-living things before me? It was I who brought them. I thought that How unfortunate. No one thinks here but me! Artoo, be quiet. This situation calls for my most delicate diplomatic skills. Please excuse my insolent friend, Your Eminence-ness, but I know a holographic image I know not of your blasphemy. Perhaps \"holographic\" is the incorrect word in your native tongue, but it is obvious that you are not real. Not real! I'll show you not real! Hey, what are you doing back here? I said what are you doing back here? Back where? Help you? Whereabouts We're not gonna help you. We worked hard to keep these mindless organics enslaved. And if you want to order someone around, get your own organics. Oh, yeah! And just how is an astromech unit going to make our loyal subjects rebel? Uh-oh. Oh, my! Oi, get them! Uh-oh, again! Artoo! It's time to leave but we still need to recharge. Here they come! They're coming for us. We're done for! They're gonna kill us! Run for it! It's all your fault, Artoo, all your fault. Whatever will we do now? Artoo, I'm talking to you. Please don't mumble. Artoo, you're almost out of power. Here, rest. Me? I have 1.723% left in my power core. I thought for sure you would have figured something out by now. You're usually so good at that sort of thing. Oh, Artoo, don't leave me, please. Rest, my friend. I will be joining you soon. That Republic Y-wing is a great prize. Do you think there are any Jedi around? Don't worry. We be takin' off before anyone realizes we've landed. What have we here? Looks like two droids that ran out of power. Lookie, lookie here. Come to papa. There you go. This should be a fun one. Who would rescue us? Master Anakin? Artoo, you're recharged. I'm recharged! We survived. Where are we? Pirates? Oh, my. What are they cheering for? Oh, goodness gracious me! Soon it will be us. Oh, my stars! Oh, no! General, we've come across what appears to be a pirate ship. Use that ship for target practice. Open fire! All forward cannons open fire. Battle stations! Oh, my! Go get him, Artoo. Oh, no, we'll never get back to the ship! We surrender. We surrender! Uh, where did you come from? They must be pirate droids. Pirate droids! You're under arrest. Pirate droids? We're not pirate droids. We are part of the Republic. Oh, yes, we are pirate droids. That is what we thought. Send them off to the incinerator room with the rest of the pirate scum. The incinerator room? Yes. You will be melted down for General Grievous' war machine. This is terrible. No! No! Oh, this trip has been nothing but calamity all the way. Thanks for the rescue, Master Plo. General Grievous has fled. Very good! Finish off the remaining droids. We're Republic. We belong to Senator Amidala. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! I can't believe it. You know these droids, Commander Wolffe? Yes, sir. We transported them to Master Gallia's ship after we left the planet Aleen. Yes, Commander Wolffe. How have you been, sir? We have been on quite an adventure. Well, I'm certain Wolffe would love to hear about it. Uh, actually, sir - Excellent! It's a long story. - Uh - And you won't believe it.

Rebel leader Steela Gerrera has joined forces with General Tandin after boldly rescuing Onderon's former king from execution, evading a trap set by Separatist ally King Rash and the droid general Kalani. Amid growing public support and rising unrest, Ahsoka continues to monitor the rebels' efforts as they rally around Ramsis Dendup to restore his reign as the rightful king and finally put an end to the Separatist occupation of Onderon. I'm picking up an electromagnetic field. Roger, roger. It's coming from there. Whoa! My fellow subjects, I appear not as your king but as a servant of Onderon. We are in the midst of a great struggle. The Confederacy has used the recent attacks as an opportunity to tighten their hold on Onderon. They have accused me of leading these so-called terrorists. It is a lie they have engineered to further restrict your independence and use deadly force against our people. The truth is, I have never met them before now. I have come to know them as the true sons of Onderon. They are unwilling to surrender our freedom to those who conspire to take it from us. Our destiny is tied to them and this planet. We must all rise together to protect it. Uh-oh. Why are they looking at us that way? Hey! What the? Blast them! Ahh! Uh-oh. The people are turning against the droids. There's rioting in the streets now. That's a beautiful thing. We need to keep the battle to the outskirts of the city. Less structures and people. But less clankers. Their main force is in Iziz. We should join the fight down there and take it straight to King Rash. We all want victory, but not at the cost of innocent lives. If we fight door to door, no one is safe. This is war, Steela. She's right. I agree. The more you draw the droids from the city to the highlands, the safer the people will be. My men await your command, my Lord. I believe there's a new contender. You will lead our forces, including the Royal Army. Steela is now the commanding general. A great choice. As you wish, my Lord. You and your rebels renewed my faith in myself. Now I'm putting my faith in you. Thank you, Your Majesty. Let's ride. Just in case. We are losing the public. If they turn against us, I fear the outcome. Fear will bring them back. We must eliminate Dendup, General Tandin, and the terrorists before the people commit to their efforts. General Tandin is weak. His army will not withstand the power of the Confederacy. Neither will the terrorists. General, our scouts have located the main rebel forces in the mountains to the east. With the rioting in the city, how can we spare the troops to attack the rebels in the mountains? Do not underestimate our means. If the rebel army falls, the citizens will lose their courage, and order will be restored. Your target lies in the mountains to the east. The army will follow. Leave no survivors. Go. By your command. The droid army is almost here. Everyone, get ready. Ready. Saw, begin your attack. Yah! Ahh! No! Where did that come from? There. Any ideas? Yeah. Run! Ahh! I take it the rebels have Dooku's full attention. It's a full-scale war. They need our help. Please talk to the Council. Even Master Windu would be wary at this point. The Council will not engage or involve the Republic in an internal affair. The Separatists have a new gunship with a powerful ray shield. Nothing's getting past it. I am sorry, Ahsoka. They will have to find a way. Do not stay there if their failure is certain. Evacuate who you can and return to Coruscant immediately. Do you understand? Yes, Master. We need to help them. We will do what we can to relocate the survivors. Before they lose their planet. We can't. What difference does it make now? The Separatists know we're involved. I don't disagree with you, Anakin, but to send in Republic gunships defeats our purpose. We must stay true to our intentions, learn our lessons. It doesn't have to look like we're the ones helping. What if another party was involved? Another party? Who in the galaxy would be running around with an extra batch of missiles? Hondo. Is the Republic going to help us? No. What's it going to take? King Rash rules Onderon. Unless that changes, the Republic can't do anything. They're pulling back. Cover them. At this rate, the clankers aren't going to need reinforcements. We have to regroup at the nest. Yah! Skywalker, my old friend. You come alone? For your service. Oh, business! Good, good, good. That I understand. I need you to make a delivery for me. And that all I am to you, Jedi? A delivery boy? I know that if I need arms shipped illegally, you're the man I need to come to. Illegally? Now, why would a Jedi need to deliver arms illegally? How about I pay you well enough that you just deliver the missiles for me and don't ask any questions? Well, as long as you're not paying me in credits, I'm sure I could accommodate your wishes, Master Jedi. The highlands may slow down the droids, but they won't stop the gunships. We have to move. Any word from Master Skywalker? Not yet. We're not giving up yet. Stagger our defenses to the camp. Secure the approach. Stay in small teams. Make use of our training. You really are the best leader among us. Couldn't be more proud of you, my sister. I learned from the best, big brother. Let's go, General. You have to help us. I'll do all I can to protect you, but I can't fight this war for you. We wouldn't have made it this far without you. I wish I could do more. Wait. Looks like we have company. Don't shoot! Well, you could be my new favorite spice. Yeah, I don't think so. Careful, pirate. Hondo, what are you doing here? Oh, no, no, no. You should thank me, child. I have brought you a gift from Skywalker and Kenobi. The latest from Sienar. Rocket launchers? Shoulder fired. Very expensive. Paid for? Very handsome-- Oh! Oh, my, look at the time. Well, my work here is done. Ugh, they must have seen Hondo's ship. It was only a patrol. We have to get these down to the others. Load them up. I hope they work. There's only one way to find out. We've tried everything, but we're target practice for those gunships. Now it's their turn. Thank the Jedi. Saw! I love this! Distribute the rocket launchers and take out those gunships. Steela, they're attacking the nest. They're after the king! Come on! She sure leads by example. What good will that do us if she gets herself killed? Steela, hurry! Steela, come in! Ugh! Where is the false king? I'll never tell you! Ugh! Find the king. Help has arrived! Are you all right, Your Majesty? Thanks to you. Fire! Last one's mine. Get down! Look! Hangon! Steela! Ah! I'll handle this. I got you. Your gunships have failed. I need more reinforcements. Really? General Kalani, what is your assessment of the situation? They have managed to penetrate our shields and are using the cover of the highlands against our forces. To defeat them will take time. A prolonged war does not interest me, General. Their rebellion grows with every small victory. Then we are lost. Salvage the remaining arms and withdraw the army. Bring them to Agamar. What about-- Ugh! It was my fault. I shot that gunship down, and it crashed into her position. Saw, it's not your fault. She knew what the risks were. We all knew what it would take to free Onderon. This has been quite a journey for our Padawan. Steela will be a powerful spirit in their lives. Yes. For all of us. I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks, but it's over now. Let's just leave it at that. Steela would be glad. Her sacrifice gave Onderon its freedom. But at what cost? It's like you once said. Many lives get caught between the Republic and the Separatists. I did say that once, but after watching your heroics and the selflessness of the Jedi, I do believe the Republic is the right side to be on. What do you mean? Dendup has appointed me the new Senator of Onderon. I will follow in my mother's footsteps, and I will bring us back to the Republic. Remember this day, the day Onderon became free again.   \n                "}, "Sacrifice": {"episode": "s06e13", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t6x13 - \"Sacrifice\"  Darkness on Dagobah! All attention is focused on Yoda, who claims to hear the voice of a long-dead Jedi. Convinced that he is guided by Qui-Gon Jinn, he finds five priestesses who will teach him how to manifest consciousness after death. After many trials, Yoda travels to Moraband, ancient home planet of the Sith, for now he must face the true evil that may be his undoing and one that seeks to control the galaxy. Careful we must be. Deserted this planet was, long ago after many wars. Again, leave you I must, my friend. Guard the ship you will. If return I do not by three nightfalls, take the ship to Coruscant you shall. Tell them of where I went. We are the Sith. Afraid of you I am not. We shall see. There is no life after death. Only nothingness awaits you, Jedi. Your fear feeds our hunger for power. They will know you are here. We will tell them. You will die and be nothing. Sir, you have been ordered to go to Coruscant immediately. Tell Lord Sidious I am on my way. Why do you come to my tomb, Jedi? To learn. Do you know who I am? Yes. Darth Bane. The ancient Sith Lord, you are. And know why I am not forgotten? Created the Rule of Two you did. The Sith killed each other Victims of their own greed. But from the ashes of destruction, I was the last survivor. I chose to pass my knowledge on to only one. I created a legacy so resilient that now you come before me. Have you come to be my apprentice? You must kill me to gain my place. Dead you are already. Then what stands before you? An illusion. Real you are not. You do not fear me? No. Exist you do not anymore. No! Yoda Yoda I sense we have a great opportunity to strike a deadly blow to the Jedi Order. But we must act swiftly. A warning I must give you. Yes. All your trials you have faced have been our doing. And you have passed them well. But inside, there is a place where we have no control, for it is a place of absolute darkness. What happened here? It is the chamber where the Sith would sacrifice Jedi. The Sith of your time will find you there, and you will find them. Be careful, for what they may offer will certainly feel like an answer. Only the presence of someone significant to you would allow you to sense this ripple through time and space. My old master Yoda. Yes. Master Yoda has come to Moraband, although why, I do not know. We shall, however, use the strong bond that once existed between you and your master to allow us to see things that we otherwise could not. How can this be done, Master? It is an old art of the dark side. Now, hold out your hand, Apprentice. I need but a drop for the ritual to begin. Kintik hadzuska sutta chwituskak! Kintik hadzuska sutta chwituskak! Jiaasjen Jidai, jiassjen Jidai! Now, concentrate on Master Yoda. Bring all your focus to him. But will he not sense our presence? We shall come to him with a familiar face, a long-lost face, one he would be eager to see again, one whom he would ask and want answered all the questions he seeks. Help me. Please, please free me. Sifo-Dyas? Alive you are! Help me, please, Yoda. I have been imprisoned for so long. Know who did this to you? What if I could tell you who the Sith Lord is? Free me, and I will reveal it. No! He knows how to achieve what you seek. Captivated by the physical realm the Sith are. What else is there? Free me, and together we can know who the Sith Lord is, gain the power you deserve, and save the future. No. You must free me! Nothing to show me the Sith have. We shall see. Sidious There is no question. The ship was carrying Count Dooku. We've scanned the area, and he is meeting with someone inside the building. Thanks, Rex. Master Yoda, what are your orders? - Orders? - Are you all right, Master? - Where am I? - I don't understand. Tell me you must! The industrial sector on Coruscant. What is happening here? A rogue shuttle slipped through the security grid. We suspect Dooku was on board. - And? - Master, this is your mission. Are you sure you're all right? Clouded, the dark side has made me. Tell me, who is inside? We intercepted a transmission calling Dooku to Coruscant. We believe he is meeting with his master, the Sith Lord. Feel it I do. Feel their power. Your orders, Master? Capture them we will. The time has come to discover the identity of this Sith Master. And if they escape? Escape, not. If it comes to it Execute them we must. End it now we will. Move in. I've got two confirmed targets. Be ready for additional unfriendlies. It appears we have company. Take 'em! We meet at last, Darth Sidious. You cannot stop what is to come. Skywalker, no! No! Save him, Jedi? Can you save him? Why not let him go? Let him die, and you can stop all that I will do. No! The future is not yours yet. Tempted I will not be. Sacrifice all I am ready to do. We have failed to break Master Yoda. He is strong. We will need more time if we are to defeat him and the Jedi. Yoda Come back to us, Yoda. Died have I? In a way. Now does my training begin? The one you know as Qui-Gon Jinn will commune with you and guide your training. Like us, you shall learn to maintain your consciousness after death. Enlightenment, spirit, balance There is another Skywalker There is another Skywalker? Yes, time to go home it is. The Council has assembled. They are eager to hear your report. Afraid not much there is to say of my journey. So nothing significant happened to you out there? Yes and no. To the end we are coming now. Did your journey give you insight on how to win the war? No longer certain that one ever does win a war I am. For in fighting the battles, the bloodshed already lost we have. Yet, open to us, a path remains that unknown to the Sith is. Through this path, victory we may yet find. Not victory in the Clone Wars but victory for all time.   \n                "}, "Escape from Kadavo": {"episode": "s04e13", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA people enslaved! To locate the abducted colonists of a peace-loving world, the Jedi infiltrated the slaver planet of Zygerria, only to be captured by its ambitious queen, who plots to rebuild her empire of oppression. Now even Obi-Wan Kenobi must come to terms with a life in chains. Obi-Wan Kenobi, once a Jedi master, now a Jedi slave. Pitiful. Keep eyes on your toil, skug! Everything about this place is designed to shatter the will. It has already begun to affect these poor people. Speech is forbidden! I'm sorry. It won't happen again. There will be punishment! No, stop, it's my mistake! Leave him alone! Now a slave gives me commands? Beg! Beg me before this one dies because of you! Please. Forgive me, Master. Keep away from me. Jedi only make things worse. Long have Sith empires been built upon the backs of slaves. To carry on this tradition, we will require millions. I assure you, the Queen's defiance will not sour your plans, Master. If she fails to see the error of her ways, end her rule. Have you considered my offer, Skywalker? If you vow loyalty to me, I will free your friends. It's not an easy decision. Hmm, curious. I thought the Jedi were selfless, placing the needs of others before their own. My Queen, I bring word. Count Dooku is on his way here. Ah, sooner than anticipated. Make preparations for his arrival. So even you have a master. Dooku is not my master! Perhaps you should not attend this meeting. Can I trust you not to run away? I don't run away from anything, Your Highness. Hmm Get off, you miserable tin can! Get down there and find that Jedi. Yes, sir. Nice work, pal. You find Ahsoka? I wasn't expecting you, Count. Not without an invitation. But I was invited, by your faithful advisor. He's concerned over how attached you've become to Skywalker. Skywalker is a symbol of my Our power to enslave even Jedi. Your power over him is an illusion. You forget, I was once a Jedi myself. You have little in common with Anakin. Please, hear my plans for the Jedi, then decide. Right now, at my facility in the Kadavo system, Obi-Wan Kenobi is in despair. I'm listening. Kenobi is coming to realize, perhaps for the first time in his life, that his efforts to help others will only injure them. As plans for escape and hopes of rescue fade, the gnawing fear that he will never be able to take action will grow in Kenobi's heart. To ease the burden of his fellow slaves, defiance will become compliance. When Kenobi realizes he cannot help those around him, his spirit will break and he will be mine. If such Jedi as Skywalker and Kenobi can fall, how many others will follow? Hmm? Imagine Imagine an army of Jedi in your service. Zygerria will be invincible! A most ambitious plan, Your Highness. Only my goal is not the enslavement of the Jedi Order, but its extermination. I have come to supervise their execution, perform it if necessary. Now, summon Skywalker. Well, hello, Master. Took you long enough. Well, I knew you had a nice view. Are you okay? I sense a disturbance in the Force. It's Dooku. I need you to get our ship. Here, take this comlink. Where are you going? The Queen knows where Obi-Wan is. Hold on to that comlink and wait for my signal. Come on, Artoo. I have no desire to end Skywalker's life. He has become a valuable asset to me and my throne. Your compliance is not optional. I command you to kill Skywalker. I will not be ordered about in my own palace, Count! If you won't do my bidding, perhaps your prime minister will. Atai, what does he mean? I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but the Count is right. The Jedi should die. You're not fit to be queen any longer. Atai, you traitor! I'll make you both pay for this treachery. Punishment for a slave who disobeys her master. That's enough, Dooku! Skywalker. I see the Queen has given you a long leash. One more step and I will end her life. Why would you think I care about this slaver scum? Indeed. The Queen! She was murdered by the Jedi. That's our signal. Let's get going. Take your vengeance! Your Highness. No escape for any of us. Where is Obi-Wan? Tell me. Kadavo system. You were right, Skywalker. I am a slave. Just as you are. Someone wishes to speak with you. Obi-Wan Kenobi. In chains once again, I see. Count Dooku. Still afraid to get your hands dirty? I would gladly make an exception in your case, my friend. I wanted to say a proper farewell before Keeper Agruss puts you to death. Keeper, the slave ship Tecora is making an unscheduled landing on platform two-four. Skywalker. So much for our ride home. What now? We get through the old fashioned way. Kenobi, tell your young friend, Skywalker, if he does not surrender, the slaves will be terminated in his name. Anakin! I'm glad to see you, but I'm afraid our host feels otherwise. You can't make everyone happy, Master. They're threatening to kill the slaves unless you surrender. It's good to see you're always ready to negotiate. But I've had enough bargaining with slave drivers. Anakin, you must realize this is a fight you cannot win alone. Who said I was alone? Keeper, a fleet of warships has dropped out of hyperspace in sector six. Jedi reinforcements! Wolf leader to wolf pack, accelerate to attack speed. This is Warthog, we're going in. Rex! Now! About time. Those towers are ray shielded. I hope you told Master Plo not to destroy this facility before we get off of it. Yeah, all of us and the slaves. We'll need a bigger ship. I'm catching too much heat! R-7, cut the engines! Yeah! That got 'em. Good work, General! Keep your focus, Warthog. Watch out for those towers! No! The walls, they're electrified. The controls are destroyed, Master Plo. There's nothing we can do from here! I cannot move the cruiser in for the rescue operation until those enemy canons are destroyed. We'll take care of those canons. Just make sure that cruiser gets down here. We're running out of time! I'm going to go help my people, I'll see if I can buy us some time! Good luck! Incoming! A Jedi! You're all clear, Master Plo. Bring the cruiser down to the landing pad. Cancel that order, Master! There's no way to get the people out of the holding cell and up to the landing platform. But I have an idea. We need to have the cruiser move in underneath the facility. We can escape onto the ship if Admiral Coburn can get in close enough. You heard Commander Tano. I want the men topside with rocket packs and cable guns. Move it! Yes, sir! Come now, Master Kenobi, I know a Jedi won't kill an unarmed man! I'm no Jedi. Okay, everyone, get ready. We'll have to go by groups! Gotcha. That's everyone. We have to go. The facility's breaking up! Okay, Master Plo, the cruiser is clear! All gunships, fire! I thank you, the Jedi, and the Republic for saving our lives. Ahsoka is the real hero. Without her creativity, I don't think we would've gotten your people to safety. Indeed. Padawan Tano, might I have a word in private? Of course. Ahsoka, you have done a great deed for your people today. You're sad? Well, you and the Jedi have done your best, but I do not think our people will recover from this horror anytime soon. I understand, but in the end, surviving this will only strengthen the people. Perhaps, and perhaps the people of Kiros will also join the Republic. I think that's a wise choice, Governor.   \n                "}, "Hunt for Ziro": {"episode": "s03e09", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t Love comes in all shapes and sizes.

Unknown to the jedi, we find Ziro in the clutches of the five Hutt families on the distant World of Nal Hutta. Gentlemen, gentlemen.

Yes, well, if you could tell time half as well as you could stick a landing, we wouldn't be behind schedule, now would we? Well, that's your opinion, man. Let's get down to business. Ziro the hutt was broken out during a hostage takeover. Yeah, I read the briefing about that mess. I suspect Jabba the Hutt is behind this. He still has it out for Ziro over the kidnapping of his son. Well, my information indicates that Ziro has damaging evidence against the Hutt council. My guess is they've taken him to the Hutt home planet Nal Hutta. As for this bounty hunter Cad Bane, we must capture and Return both he and his quarry Ziro to the courts. I trust you and I can keep eyes Forward in this common goal? no problem. I owe Bane one anyway. I'll fly. You're my copilot.

Bred to be perfect soldiers, These cadets must first be Subjected to intense physical And mental training before Heading off to war You're clear. You're clear! Cover fire! This is command: You must break through enemy Lines and take the tower. Comlink just relayed orders from We all had the orders, Echo! Stop calling me that. Stop repeating every order.

Thanks, CT-27-5555. That was close. It's fives. The name is \"fives.\" Yeah, Five pieces if you Don't keep your head down! How about we follow orders? This is our last practice test. Will you shut up with Instructions? You're not in charge. This particular unit seems To have some trouble. What do you recommend? Well, I'm no jedi, so forgive My bluntness, but I say they Fail. Send 'em down to maintenance Duty with 99 and the other Rejects. We can't fail them yet. Remember, this is only a Practice test. And besides, the citadel course Was constructed to be a Difficult challenge. Although I don't agree with His sentiment, bric isn't wrong. These cadets are far from ready. I can't hit anything from Here. No, we have to follow orders. The one they call \"Echo\" Never adapts to the situation. CT-782 seems to follow his Own path. He can't do it all alone. You go; I'll cover you. I'm a better shot. You go. No, you go! Look at those two. End up dead. Uh, and the last one I surrender. I surrender. Need I say more?

Can you stop being droid bait Out there? You're getting in my way. Actually, our way. Well, you want to be the Best, then you got to think Like it. And I'm thinking like an arc Trooper.

If you two would focus on Fighting droids as much as you Do fighting each other, you Might stand a chance out there. Sorry, master chief. Well, master chief, Our training.

However, I have noticed this Unit of clones have been Deficient? My only thought is for you to Search the galaxy and find a Suitable donor for your future Clones. And what of the clones Produced so far? As you know, there is no one Way to make a clone. Sometimes our efforts are less Than successful. Are you suggesting we just Cast off the domino squad? They're living beings, not Objects. You jedi show too much Compassion. Nevertheless, as general in Charge of training, the decision On what to do with them would Be yours, master jedi.

They're getting farther Than normal. Maybe so, but they're sloppy. This is nothing. Give them their next set of Orders and watch the chaos Ensue. I'm telling you, these guys Just aren't ready. I'll flank left. You flank right. Take it easy. I'm on your side. Get it? Your side, huh? Pretty unorthodox. Droidbait, behind you! Man down! Forget him! I'm breaking for the citadel. Hurry! Guys, I think he's injured. Leave him. Come on! We're gonna pass this time. Okay, I spoke too soon. That would be putting it Broke formation, disobeyed Orders, and you left a man Behind. You broke rule number one. I'm sorry, domino squad. This is an automatic failure. I told you this was going to Happen. We've wasted enough time on Those losers. Their failure is our failure. I've made a request to general Shaak Ti that the domino squad Be allowed to repeat the final Test. Why do you care about them? Why don't you? I care about getting paid. It's a shame the bounty Hunter in you sees this only as A job. More like an impossible task. These cadets will be the Finest troopers we've trained. I have faith in them. Faith? Oh, you can't be serious, El-Les. We should treat them as a Special challenge, bric. We should treat them as Failures. Besides, I've already requested That they be moved to cleanup And maintenance. That's all they're going to be Good for. Then I guess the general has A decision to make. General, may we have a word? You are here to discuss your Squad, aren't you? How did you Ah, jedi, mate. One doesn't need to be a jedi To feel the stress on your mind. General, we would like to Request a transfer to another Squad. Bravo squad, perhaps? I am a jedi, where the Individual and the group are One in the same, much like you Clones. Which is why Fives and I are Looking out for each other. As individuals, But not as a group. You are where you need to be. Solve your problems as a whole, Not as individuals. I have decided to allow you and The rest of your squad to take The test again tomorrow. You wanted to see me, sir? Near as I can tell, you're The reason your squad's a Failure. Ah, well, I'll take that as A compliment. It's all a big joke to you, Right? Like those little nicknames you And your clone brothers give Each other. Oh, I could think Of one for you right now, sir. Oh, funny. But I think it's all just A cover. You hate me, don't you? No, no, no. How could I hate you for doing Your job? You're just pushing me, sir. No, this is me pushing you. Come on, clone. Hit me. Hit me, you joker. Can't take anything seriously, Can you? You're a real cutup, aren't you? Come on! Thank you, sir. For what? For my name: Cutup. I like the sound of it. Out of my sight, cadet. One way or another, you'll be Out of this army. Count on it. Hevy, you going somewhere? Get out of here. You're going awol, aren't Just go back to sleep, 99. This doesn't concern you. But you can't do this to Your squad. My squad? We're nothing but a bad batch. Failures. Like you. Yeah, but how can I be A failure when II never even Got my chance? A chance you're throwing away. You're always trying to be the Anchor, Hevy. You know, do it on your own. Well, maybe you should embrace The fact that you have a team. See, I never had that. But you need them, And they need you. Why carry such a heavy burden On your own when you have your Brothers at your side, Hevy? Hevy? Wouldstop calling me that! We're just numbers, 99. Just numbers. Not to me. To me, you've always had a name. Hey, where's CT-782? Yeah, where is CT-782? If he is not here, we will Fail. Not today, brothers. Today we pass. And one more thing: The name's Hevy. Orders came in clear, mates. Nothing to repeat, Echo? Not today. How's that shoulder treating You? I'll live. We all know what we have To do. That's it, boys. Stay together! Fives, on your left. Thanks, cutup. No problem, brother. They seem to be working Together. Still early. A lot can change. Keep it up. We're doing great. We might actually pass. Not so fast; still got the Citadel. All right, prep the Ascension cables. Let's scale this thing. Wait a tick. Where are the cables? They're not in our belts. Just when things seemed easy. Well, we can't scale the face Without them. We'll fail the test if we can't Finish. What's going on? Where are their ascension Cables? Must have gotten lost. What did you do? I thought you had faith They'd be the best, right? Well, the best pass, No matter what. General, you have to stop This. This is unfair to the cadets. Adversity in war is A constant, el-Les. But bric has cheated. The enemy won't play fair Either. So this is it? Not exactly. Those guns up there We can use them as a step to The next level, form a chain, And use each other To scale this face. Use the guns? Are you crazy? Trust me. I know weapons. I'm gonna draw their fire. You guys blast 'em. Well, I'll be Creative little clones, aren't They? No unit has shown such Ingenuity. We did it! I knew we could do it, boys! We made it! Bric, your actions have Brought out the best in these Looks like they were Well-Trained, perhaps the Finest soldiers I've ever seen. Well, maybe you were right, El-Les. Congratulations. You've graduated. At ease. Next stop, arc trooper. Yeah, how 'bout we face some Combat first? You were right, you know, About everything. I heard you were quite The leader out there. No leaders. We are a team. All of us, 99. The army's lucky to have A clone like you, Hevy. Not as lucky as I am to have Well, this is good-Bye, I guess. Hevy ships out, and 99 stays Here. Eh, we'll see each other Again. I mean, how else am I supposed To get this back from you? You deserve it. You're one of us. Today is your graduation. From here, you ship out to Fight against the separatists And restore peace to the Republic. Congratulations. You are no longer cadets. You are troopers. May the force be with you. Attention! Helmets on! Separatist attack! After the destruction of The republic outpost on the Rishi moon, general Grievous And Asajj Ventress plan An attack the planet Kamino, Home of the cloning factories. Meanwhile, aboard a jedi Cruiser, jedi knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi examine an intercepted Message from general Grievous. We are decrypting the audio, Sir. The clone planet of Kamino Will be a dangerous target. Just make sure you hold up Your half of the mission. We must stop the production Of new clones If we are to win this war. Kamino. They're going to attack Our home planet. The separatists are taking Quite the chance Even considering this. With all due respect, General, if someone comes To our home, they better Be carrying a big blaster. I concur with captain rex, Sir. This is rsonal for us clones. We'll make sure Kamino Is secure. Tell your troopers in the 501st They're going home. Yes, sir. All is ready, general. Good. We will attack tipoca city First. I have the exact locations Of both the clone dna room And the clone trooper barracks. Both shall be annihilated Under my hand. Our hands, general. Count dooku assigned us both This task. But of course, assassin. I look forward to meeting you. Are the aqua droids prepared For phase two of the plan? Yes, mistress. Masters Kenobi and Skywalker, Welcome to Kamino. Greetings, generals. I wish our arrival Wasn't under such circumstances. We believe Grievous is planning A separatist attack on Kamino. But the republic blockade Is far too strong. They would not dare. Ah, look around, Fives. Feels like yesterday We were here, Heading to target practice. Heh, remember that? Do I ever. Hey, 99. Ha, Echo. Fives. You actually remember us. Oh, I remember all my Brothers. Is Hevy here? Where's he? There was an incident On the Rishi moon outpost. He saved our lives, But he gave up his own. Uh, let's see! Hevy gave you his medal? So why have you returned To Kamino? The generals received word Of an impending attack here. Well, how can I help? Attack formation Echo-3. Status. Deflector shields raised. Destroyers in position. Forward cannons ready. Landing craft prepared. All ships are in position. Commence attack. The separatist fleet Is pressing their attack, sir. Contact command At tipoca city. Shore up our defenses. The fleet is not as large As I expected. Begin the air strike. Good to see you, general. Ready to have some fun? You know me, broadside. I'd rather be up here Than stuck in a command center. Warning! Falling debris. Grievous appears to be Sacrificing his transports In favor of protecting His command ship. Something's not right. Reinforcements have arrived. Send out the aqua droids To assemble the assault craft. Focus on the cruisers. I'm gonna press the attack, Master. No, Anakin. Wait. It's too easy. Not even Grievous would attack So recklessly. Master, the battle's up here In space, not down there. The debris from the destroyed Separatist ships is the key. What are you thinking? I think I'd like to go For a swim. Nothing as of yet. Only you could be worried About the ships I already Shot down. Wait a minute. Aqua droids. Looks as though they're Assembling assault craft. Anakin, I was right. Those downed transports Were hiding ships for An underwater assault. Anakin, come in! Hold it right there. Do not move. Thanks for the lift, friend. Anakin, the city is under Attack. I need you down here now! On my way. Sir, you sent for us? It's a dangerous assignment, But I want you two up On the bridge in sniper Positions. Yes, sir. We're on it. Watch out! This is no place for you. There aren't enough droids Here to capture the city. They're trying to distract us. Go protect the dna chamber. I'll deal with Grievous. Got it. Fives, keep firing. We can beat these guys. Zap! II brought you some ammo. Is there a better spot Than this, a better defensive Position we can take? Droids! Behind us! Look! Grenades! Thanks, 99. Good job. Look out. There's more. Cadets. What are you doing here? We got separated From our group. Where were they taking you? The barracks. Oh, I know the best way There. Keep firing. No mercy! Your skills are impressive. Perhaps a match for my own, Assassin. Count dooku may have taught You how to swing a lightsaber, General, but that hardly Makes you my equal. And yet I am the general In charge of this assault. Remember, assassin, You are to recover The clone dna. Why not just destroy it? Because the dna could unlock New possibilities for us. Keep playing with your Droids. I'll handle breaking into The dna room. Shall I provide you With a droid escort? My dear general, There's nothing you have That I could want. What are we gonna do? A separatist victory Means death for all of us. The cadet is right. What are we gonna do? We fight. But our training's not Finished. Look around. We're one in the same, Same heart, same blood. Your training is in your blood. And my blood's boiling For a fight. This is our home. This is our war. What about weapons? The armory. It's just a few corridors away Here in the barracks. I can retrieve all the firepower That we need. Hah, so who wants to blast Some droids? The droids are spread thin. We must press our offensive now. I was beginning to think My presence went unnoticed. You weren't planning On leaving without saying hello, Were you? Ha, here it is. Everything we need is here. Excellent work, 99. Hurry up. The droids have almost reached The barracks. Let's get into position. Open up. Get those doors open And scare the remaining clones Out of hiding. Roger, roger. Blast them. All too easy. Define \"easy,\" general. Kenobi. Kenobi, Kamino has fallen. Your clone army is doomed. I beg to differ, Grievous. Cadets, now! Last one, commander. Make it count. I'll get more. I'm a soldier like you. This is what I was bred for. Commander Cody. Yes, sir. The droids have been pushed Back to the main hangar. We've got to stop meeting Like this, my friend. Move it, troopers! On the double! Fire! Look! It's the general! To surrender. Actually I plan to let the clones execute you Right now. Not this time. We did it. We held them back. We lost a true soldier. He really was one of us. Echo, Fives. You both really stepped up In the heat of battle. We did what we had to do, Sir, What any clone would have done. Both of you showed valor Out there, real courage. Reminded me of me, actually. Echo, Fives, You're both officially Being made arc troopers. I don't think the separatists Will be coming back here Any time soon. But if they do, Kamino will be lucky To have clones like you defending it. Good job, men!   \n                "}, "The Disappeared (1)": {"episode": "s06e08", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t6x08 - \"The Disappeared\", part 1 Mystery on Bardotta! An oasis of peace during the Clone Wars. The galaxy-wide conflict now threatens the ancient ways of the Bardottan people. With their spiritual leaders mysteriously vanishing, the foundations of order in its system are near collapse. In desperation, the Queen of Bardotta has called upon the Republic Senate with a puzzling request: to help save her people from certain doom. I have humbly come before you to ask for assistance in our time of need, Chancellor. Queen Julia, the Republic is honored that you have come to us for aid. We are always happy to support the neutral systems in a time of crisis. If I may introduce two of our best Ambassadors With all due respect, Chancellor, there is only one person in the Republic I will meet with. Representative Binks? Why would the Queen of Bardotta request the presence of Jar Jar Binks? I'm afraid she would not say, but she impressed upon the Senate the urgency of their situation. And what exactly is the trouble on Bardotta? Several of the ancient mystics, the Dagoyan Masters, have disappeared. A strong connection to the Force the Dagoyan Masters have. Yet unlike the Jedi or Sith they are. Warriors they are not. Intuition, knowledge, the harmony of the universe is what they sense. Passively they connect with the Force. I wonder why the Queen doesn't want a Jedi sent to solve this mystery. Long ago, inducted into the Jedi Order Bardottan children were. However thieves the Jedi were named by the Dagoyan. The Dagoyan Masters believed the Jedi took the children against their will. We were labeled as kidnappers. Chancellor, am I to understand the Queen requested Representatives Binks go alone to Bardotta? I'm afraid she was quite specific on that point. I think that course of action is unwise. If there is trouble on Bardotta, I'm afraid Representative Binks will be out of his depth. I agree, which is why I came to you. We await your decision. Are you volunteering to undertake this mission, Master Windu? If the Council agrees, yes. Do not touch anything. Oh, mesa not doing nothing. Hmm. Representative Binks, I do not mean to be presumptuous, but are you sure you are the delegate the Queen spoke of? Yup. The Queen is mesa pallo. Mesa knowin' her for a longo time. The Queen did not request your presence, Jedi. Your lightsaber, please. Mesa Representative Binks of the Republic Senate, and hesa with mesa. Representative Binks, you are an honored guest of the Queen. Come. Oh! Representative Binks of the Republic, you were requested to come here alone. Why have you brought this Jedi to Bardotta? Oh, Great Queenie Julia, please forgive mesa. Disa Jedi is mesa pallo. Hesa coming here to be helping mesa solve your troubles. He is your servant, then? Umm Yes! Yes, dat is the truth. Masteren Mace is mesa humble servant. Very well. Jedi, because Jar Jar Binks vouches for you, I will allow you to stay here. For now, you must wait in the antechamber. Jar Jar, we are in danger. An ancient prophecy is coming true. Our beloved Dagoyan Masters are disappearing one by one, and if they are not returned, a darkness will arise that will engulf the galaxy. Mesa not letting that happen, milady. High Seneschal Peteen, I must speak to Representative Binks alone. It's been a long time, my love. Come. Meditate with me, so our minds may be as one. There is a great disturbance in the Force here. That much is certain. I can sense it all around me. Hmm, difficult to see. Such disdain for the Jedi there is on Bardotta. A good place for evil to hide it may be. Yet remember, drifting within the flow of the living Force, the minds of the Dagoyan Masters are. Essential this connection is, whether friend to the Jedi they be or not. Hmm. If you are looking for a friend of the Bardottan's, look no further than Representative Binks. The Queen has been alone with him for quite some time now. The innocence of a child this Gungan has. Perhaps appealing to the Dagoyan his mind is. Well, my mind would be more at ease if I knew what they've been up to. I'm here to see Representative Binks. The Queen said no interruptions. Jar Jar, I asked you here because I trust you, because I know you will be able to help me in ways others cannot. Mesa hoping so, milady. You will let me inside. You should know better, Master Jedi. That will not work on a Dagoyan. Hmm. I have discovered a terrible secret, buried within the rippling waves of the Force. Uh, maybe itsa best to get Masteren Mace to hear this. No, Jar Jar, only you. I must tell you. I cannot trust the Jedi with this secret. When the Dagoyan Masters started disappearing, I meditated to try and discover their whereabouts, but what I saw was shocking. I stumbled upon a terrible plot. Excuse the intrusion, your majesty. I will not excuse you! Where are the guards who told you to enter? The guards had other business to attend to. We apologize, your majesty. The Jedi slipped past us. You see, Jar Jar, these Jedi are deceptive, as I said. Julia Queenie, uh, but yousa let mesa handle dis. I promise da Jedi Masteren Mace will besa no trouble for you. Very well, Jar Jar. Take him out of my sight. I will wait right here for you. Careful! What do you think you're doing? Where were you last night? Doing? Mesa love da Queen Julia. Wadsa wrong witdat? You are jeopardizing the mission. No, no, Masteren Jedi. Mesa love for beautiful Julia is da only thing startin' the talks. Shesa trustin' only mesa oh, and now yousa a little. You must understand, Jar Jar, the Force is strangely out of balance here. Did the Queen tell you anything important? Dats what she was trying to do before yousa come in all hot-like. Take this. Since they seem to want to keep us separated, contact me if you learn anything useful. Okey-day, Masteren Mace, but only if Queenie thinks it's all right to tell you. Masteren Mace, come quickly! Shesa gone! Queenie is gone! Calm yourself, Binks. Dissin bad, very very bad. She has disappeared, like the other Dagoyan Masters before her. But it's not possible. No one could have left this room without our knowing it. I will convene the Bahk-tov Council. Come! Guards! Bahk-tov toi! There can be no doubt. The prophecy is being fulfilled, as it was written. First, the Dagoyan Masters disappeared, and now the Queen. If she does not return in three rotations, I'm afraid she will be gone forever and an era of Darkness will rise throughout the galaxy. Distinguished Council, if I may The coming of the Jedi was a sign! It was a sign! Harbinger of doom! The harbinger of doom! Council! Oh, great Bardotta Council. Please, yousa must listen to mesa. Queenie Julia was me bombad pallo for many years. Shesa knew there be troubles here. Dats why she callin' mesa, to helpin' in your time of need. Mesa takin' my loyal helper, Masteren Mace, and we findin' da Queenie and bringin' her backin to yousa. Ask them about the origin of the prophecy. Now, let mesa askin' yousa where dis prophecy comin' from. They are the words of the Frangawl clan, who worshipped to Malmourral, the ancient demon of our faith. Their ancient shrine is located under our present-day Temple, far beneath the surface. It is a cursed place, an evil place. No one who enters those caverns ever returns. Then that is where we must look first. Den dats where we be goin' first! Oh, boi! Dis gonna be bombad trouble. Mesa knowin' it. Um, uh, are yousa sure dissa the right way? Yes, but ahead there is only darkness and evil. Then, yes, Jar Jar, this is the correct path. Okay. Hmm Here's your weapon, Master Jedi. Let us hope you do not have to use it. The Frangawl ruled Bardotta with an iron hand for most of its early history. They were warriors. Some would call them barbarians, but in fact they were men and women of spirit. Mesa no liken this place. No way. Look a piece of the Queenie Julia's headdress! Oh, no. Mesa disappearin'. Mesa disappearin'! Masteren Mace! Help! Masteren Mace! Masteren Mace! Jar Jar! He's been taken, just like the Queen. You go back and get help. I'll go after him. Put mesa down! Put mesa down! Wheresa yousa taken me? Woah! Ah! Oh! Put mesa down! Whoa! Oh! Ah! Ah Oohie me. Oochie. Oh, thank goodness. Mesa can see mesa self again. Whosa yousa, sir? I am Joseph, Dagoyan Master of the Royal Council. The others you see with me also have been disappeared and brought here. You'll never free yourself. We are doomed to be sacrificed to Malmourral. This is bombad trouble. Jar Jar, Where are you? Jar Jar! Ooh! Masteren Mace! Masteren Mace! Mesa found the disappearin' Daba-boyboy-ogans. I'll follow your signal. Wherever you are, don't move. Datsa no problem. Mesa not goin' nowheres. Uh-oh. Mesa movin'. Mesa movin'! I told you not to do that, Jar Jar. It's not mesa fault! Oime! Masteren Mace! Masteren Mace! Quiet! Hmm. Julia! Jar Jar. Mesa here to rescue yousa. Jar Jar, they are stealing the Force. They are stealing the Force within us. Humbah! Looganah! Humbah! Looganah! Disjenck! Now shall the demon of war, Malmourral, be sated. Now shall the Frangawl clan steal your essence. No! Whosa you? Oh! Let mesa go! Let mesa go! Let mesa go! No! Let mesa go! Let mesa go! Oh Nosa ticklin'. Issa cold! Blasphemer. Uh, mesa not big with the Force. Yousa got the wrong Gungan. The Force resides within all living things. What little you have will be ours. Jar Jar! Hmm? Get him! Yah! Stay back. Mesa bombad warrior. Oh Oh Get mesa outta here! Oh! Look out! Grab my hand! Mesa need to save the Queenie. Go! Oh! The demonic cult of Malmourral is active once again. If they steal the essence of the Queen, darkness will fall across the stars. Mesa no bombad warrior, but mesa swearin' to find yousa Queenie with the help of mesa bombad pallo, Masteren Mace! Jar Jar, maybe it's this place, but you're starting to make sense to me.   \n                "}, "The Lost One": {"episode": "s06e10", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t6x10 - \"The Lost One\"  A long-awaited truth! A distress signal has been received at the Jedi Temple, and Master Plo Koon has been dispatched to investigate its origin. The signal is from a ship thought to be lost and was last known to be in the possession of a Jedi Master who was killed long ago. Can anyone hear us? Come in, please. We're not getting anything over here. We're off. We must be way off. Negative. It is here. The data specifically states. It has got to be. We've scanned the area three times. This this is a wasteland. There's nothing. All of our information pinpoints it is here. I don't know what to tell you, sir. We're getting no visual and no recognition on the scanner. We must locate the source of the signal, Commander. Press on. Wait. I think I've found something. It's very faint, sir. That is it. Halt! Halt! Halt all vehicles! The hull shows substantial scoring and wear. Whenever it crashed, it wasn't recently. General Plo, the scans check out. It's a T-6 shuttle, all right, serial number 775519. I want the entire area cleared. We're taking everything back to Coruscant. Everything? Everything! Then it is the lost ship of Master Sifo-Dyas? I found this at the crash site. Hmm, the lightsaber of Sifo-Dyas it is. Never found when he died it was. Master Kenobi, remind the Council of what you discovered regarding Master Sifo-Dyas before the start of the Clone War. My investigation of the bounty hunter Jango Fett led to Kamino. The Kaminoans recounted that it was Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas who ordered the production of a clone army. Without the consent of the Council or the Senate he did this. Prior to the blockade of Naboo, Sifo-Dyas sat on this Council until we judged his ideas to be too extreme. Indeed, he said he foresaw a great conflict and that the Republic would need to raise an army. At the time, the Council rejected those ideas. Well, it's not the first time we've been wrong recently, is it? The creation of the clone army, kept secret from us Sifo-Dyas did. How this was done we know not, yet now a new piece of the puzzle we have. Perhaps clarity it will bring us, yes. Our records definitively state that Master Sifo-Dyas died on Felucia. In the fifth quarter, a small skirmish broke out between the native Felucians. Master Sifo-Dyas was assigned to negotiate peace talks between the tribes. The negotiations failed, and Sifo-Dyas was killed. What became of his body? I'm afraid I cannot answer that. Any further information on this incident has been sealed. On whose authority? By the office of the Supreme Chancellor. Thank you, Madame Jacosta. To Felucia, Skywalker and Kenobi will go. A trail long cold it is, yet still lay hidden there a clue might be. Question all who were present the day of Sifo-Dyas' death, you must. And what of the sealed file? Speak with the Chancellor personally I will to see what part in this the politics of the Senate have played. Master Sifo-Dyas? Forgive me. I'm afraid I am not familiar with that name. Died some time ago he did on Felucia. Investigating his death we are, and yet sealed by the Chancellor's office some of his files were. And what is the nature of your investigation? A Jedi matter it is, Chancellor. Add to your troubles I would not. That is very considerate, Master Yoda. May I at least ask when Master Sifo-Dyas. Yes, Master Sifo-Dyas, may I ask when he was killed? Over ten years ago it was. Well, that explains it. I'm afraid this was before my time. Ten years ago, I was a humble senator serving the planet Naboo. Only my predecessor, Chancellor Valorum, would have the answers you seek. I suggest you speak with him. Very well. Thank you, Chancellor. I have spoken with the tribal leaders on Felucia. They use a very ancient dialect, which is hard to understand, but from what I can make out, when Master Sifo-Dyas died, he was not alone. There was a second Jedi here with him. And the name of this second Jedi? Either I don't understand them, or they won't say. It's hard to tell. This is a primitive people we are dealing with. After his death, they cremated Sifo-Dyas' body, and I'm afraid the trail goes cold there. Did you have any success with the Chancellor? Hmm, as much success as usual, I am afraid. Pointed in another direction I am now. To speak with Valorum I go. It's been a long time, my friend. What can I do for you? A file sealed by your administration the Jedi Council has come across. The subject of the file? Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. Sifo-Dyas? When I was Chancellor, I sent him on a mission to deal with a flare-up in the Pyke syndicate. The Pykes? A powerful part of the spice cartel. Their criminal activities had allowed them to almost completely control the production of raw spice used to create a powerful drug. We were facing a full-scale war underneath the surface of Coruscant. Knowing of his expertise on the Underworld, I contacted Master Sifo-Dyas to stabilize the problem. Know of this, the Jedi Council did not. The Senate committee assigned to the matter feared that open discussions with such a criminal element could legitimize their activities and give strength to opposition leaders within the bureaucracy. Secrecy was our only choice. The timing of these negotiations, when were they to take place? I cannot remember the precise timing, I'm afraid. It was so long ago. I do remember that the talks were postponed not long after our delegates arrived on Oba Diah, something about a flare-up of activity on Felucia. Yes, intervene on Felucia, the Council insisted Sifo-Dyas did. But tell me, Chancellor. Who was the other Jedi you sent with Sifo-Dyas? Other Jedi? I know of no other Jedi. There was only my personal aide, Silman, and Sifo-Dyas. I'm afraid they were both killed on Felucia. Personal aide, Silman? Tell me, why do the Jedi look for Sifo-Dyas? What trail are they following? If there is a trail, it is unknown to me. Retrace your steps, find this loose end, and eliminate it. I understand what is at stake, my Lord. I will go to the Pykes and take care of it. This is not the first time you have proven to be clumsy, Lord Tyranus. You know the price of failure. The Felucians know nothing of this Silman. No one there seems to know anything about him. What's that symbol he's wearing? The symbol of the high Chancellor, before the war, Chancellor Valorum. So we have one dead Jedi with no physical evidence of a body, a second Jedi who appeared on Felucia that we have no record of, and now this Silman, personal attache to the Chancellor, is missing? Yet now we know Sifo-Dyas and Silman were both on Oba Diah, according to Chancellor Valorum. The crashed shuttle I found was located on a moon which orbits the Pyke planet. Hmm. To the Pykes you must go, to Oba Diah, yes. I cannot remember the last time a Jedi came here. Many years it has been. Funny you should say that. We're looking for a Jedi that got lost here. His name is Sifo-Dyas. Oh, the Jedi Sifo-Dyas was here, but that was a long time ago. Master Sifo-Dyas' ship was found, crashed on a moon orbiting this world. What you found, we know nothing of. Would the Jedi like to join us for a refreshment? The Pykes' offer is kindly accepted. To friendship. Friendship. Friendship. What an interesting necklace that is. May I have a look? Perhaps the Pykes have taken enough of the Jedi's time. Oh, no, no. It's no bother at all. The Jedi are happy to know all the Pykes' secrets. We have no quarrel with the Jedi. Maybe you should tell us why you're wearing the crest of the Chancellor's personal advisor. I am confused. Is the Jedi looking for a Jedi Master or someone else? Stop playing games. Sifo-Dyas was traveling with an advisor. They were sent here to negotiate with you. Well, it looks like you have finally put the pieces together. The man you are looking for is here. The Pykes wanted to gain an advantage over the other crime families, so alliances were made. One alliance was with a man named Tyranus. I've heard that name before. Jango Fett mentioned it during my Kamino investigation. Tyranus wanted Sifo-Dyas dead. The Pykes were well paid to shoot down his ship. However, any man that is willing to pay to have a Jedi killed is dangerous and unpredictable. The Pykes inspected the crash to retrieve the Jedi's body for proof. But with the dead Jedi, the Pykes found another, still alive. Silman, the Chancellor's aide? The Pykes gave Tyranus Sifo-Dyas, but the Pykes did not tell Tyranus of Silman. The Pykes needed insurance. Insurance? Yes, and now the Pykes can bargain. We give you Silman. You forget about the Pykes' treachery against the Jedi. Hello? Who who's there? We are Jedi sent to find you. Jedi? To find me? Why me? I was betrayed, forgotten long ago. No one knew you were alive. Quick. Maybe you have some food. Have you have you any food? Of course. Oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh! Thank you, my friend. A supply bar! Mmm, mmm. Delicious. You see, I was so frightened I would have nothing to serve. Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh! Serve? My my babies, they get so angry when I have nothing to serve. We might have a problem here. Tyranus, you are no longer welcome here. I think you've been cooped up in here too long, old man. We've come to take you home. Home? No, no, this is my home. I can't leave my friends. You were traveling with Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. Tell us what happened to him. Sifo-Dyas? He died. Died, died, died, died. Tricked, we were. The Pykes are not to be trusted. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. But the Pykes were not the ones. No, no, the Pykes were not the reason. Who was responsible? Someone powerful, someone who who wanted to be Sifo-Dyas. Why? All is deception. Can't you see? Because because Dooku. For once, you actually came to do your own dirty work. Sometimes things are just that important. Ah! You have no business left with the Pykes, Tyranus. Tyranus? You are the man called Tyranus? I told you everything you needed to know on Geonosis all those years ago, Kenobi. You should have joined me. Sifo-Dyas understood. He saw the future. That is why he helped me. You lie. Minister Lom, if you are going to help us, now is the time. Kill Tyranus! I'll give you a push. Know now we do that guide the creation of the clones from the beginning, Dooku did. Hmm, our enemy created an army for us. If this was known, public confidence in the war effort, the Jedi, and the Republic would vanish. There would be mass chaos. Cover up this discovery we must. No one, not even the Chancellor, may know. Valiant men the clones have proven to be. Saved my life and yours they have many times. Believe in them we must. Win the war swiftly we must, before our enemy's designs reach completion, whatever they may be. Are you sure we are taking the right path? Hmm, the right path, no. The only path, yes. Designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, this web is. For now, play his game we must.   \n                "}, "Gungan Attack": {"episode": "s04e02", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA government toppled by civil war. Refusing to accept Prince Lee-Char as the next ruler of Mon Cala, the Quarren people join the Separatist alliance, and launch an all-out attack on the Mon Calamari. Caught unprepared, the young prince and his Jedi protectors are quickly overwhelmed and forced to retreat into caves far below the capital city, leaving Count Dooku and his allies to plan their next move. And the young prince, has he been captured? No, My Lord. Unfortunately he escaped capture, and is hiding with what's left of the Jedi and their army. Do not underestimate this boy, Tamson. He must not become a symbol for the Mon Calamari people to rally behind. This child is but a coward. He is no leader. That is irrelevant. The whispering of his name can rekindle hope, and hope is something we cannot allow our enemy to possess. Excuse me, Count Dooku, but what of the prisoners? They are to be processed. Internment camps have been set up below the city. Gather the rabble there. Then set them to work. Surely, you do not mean all of them. The women and children Are to be sent as well. Is that understood? Yes, My Lord. Tamson, I'm sending you reinforcements. Hold them in reserve and wait for the Republic's next move. As you wish, Count Dooku. We've lost contact with all clone troopers and Mon Cala soldiers. The Quarren ambushed us. They were ready to attack long before the peace talks came to an end. Desperate, the situation is. Reinforce your position, clones, we can Master, please repeat. Are you sending reinforcements? You're breaking up. Are they coming? I don't know. But they know our situation. They must know to send help. Yeah, but it may take them a while to get here. We're gonna have to get ourselves to the surface and get off this rock. I will not leave my people to die. With all due respect, Your Highness, if we stay, we all die. We must reach the surface and see if our ship is still there. The prince will decide our course of action. I think it is best for us to try and escape using your ship. As you wish, Your Highness. Follow me. It'll take us days to outfit another clone regiment for underwater combat. Days our friends do not have. Perhaps we should look to armies other than clones to help our cause. What do you suggest? A suitable ally, we must find, to help with this mission. Yes, an underwater race that has a standing army, and is close enough to send help quickly. Naboo? Yes, to the Gungans, we must look. We shall contact them immediately. That's a lot of enemy troops between us and the surface. It's no problem. I just hope you're a fast swimmer. Says the boy from the desert planet. Are you certain your ship is still there? There's only one way to find out. I'll create a diversion so you can get past those patrols. All right. Try to get a mini-sub or two. It'll help us speed to the surface. No problem. Ahsoka, you're up first. Take the prince and Senator Tills. Got it! Sir, the Jedi have reappeared with the prince. They are headed to the surface. Predictable. Let them get within sight of their ship. I want them to watch their hope sink to the bottom of the sea. There's the ship. Still in one piece. Spring the trap. Oh! Well, Prince, how do you feel about fighting again? Master Jedi, we're too vulnerable here. We must reach the sea floor. Grab onto the debris. Let it carry you to the bottom. I think I'm getting seasick. - Back so soon? - Yeah, the ship had some problems. I can see that, all around me. This is our only chance. We need to split up and hide the prince's whereabouts. - I'm not sure that's the best strategy. I'm sure. Captain Ackbar's words are my own. It will give us the best chances of surviving if we split up. As you wish. Ahsoka, you and the prince go with Kit and take the clones. I'll take the senators and Captain Ackbar. Lay low. Our only hope is that Master Yoda can send help in time. No, Prince Lee-Char is our only hope. Master Yoda, sir, to what's we owing the pleasure of your transmission? Your help, the Republic needs. Something's telling me it's big help you need. No? Senator Amidala, your long-time ally, trapped on an occupied planet, she is. Hmm. Mesa needs some thinking time to respond to thisa news. Thinking! Nosa thinking. Mesa thinking Padm\u00c3\u00a9 would help us, has helped us, big time. Wesa gots to help her now. Yousa right. Thinking time's done. Wesa need to be leaving now. I don't think we've been followed. Commander Monnk, post a lookout. We have no army and we don't know if reinforcements are coming. What are our options? We sit tight. There's not much we can do. Sir, you better come see this. So many prisoners! Where are they taking them? To become slaves. I can't believe Nossor Ri and the Quarren agreed to this. Count Dooku rules here for now, not the Quarren. What you see, Prince, is the future of all the people on this world, Mon Cala and Quarren, all slaves for Count Dooku. Captain Ackbar, which of these structures houses the city's interplanetary scanners? It's over there, across the square. Why? Well, just in case Master Yoda is sending reinforcements, I thought it would be helpful if the enemy couldn't tell they were coming. If we knock out those sensors, they won't see our reinforcements until they're right on top of the city. Assuming someone is coming. I am sure Master Yoda will find a way to send help. Anakin, it's your move. Follow me. There must be something more I can do. I know it's hard, but you have to be patient. But you saw my people. I failed them. No, remember Captain Ackbar's words, \"You are the hope of your people.\" As long as you live, they will endure. I need an army. We have to fight back. You don't have to carry a sword to be powerful. Some leaders' strength is inspiring greatness in others. But my people don't even know I'm alive. How can I inspire them if they think I'm dead? Okay, just cover me. I'm gonna have to concentrate. Concentrate? Concentrate on what? Bringing that building down. Anakin, hurry. What's happening? Report! We've lost all radar and sonar scanning, sir. - Reestablish the connections. - We cannot, sir. Why not? The building that housed the radar is gone. We're blind. Prepare for an attack. But there was nothing on the scope prior to the attack. That is precisely why we must assume an attack is imminent! Guards, to me! Where are you going? To find that meddling prince and his Jedi friends! At least we're taking attention away from the prince. Oh, no, the prince Hurry! The prince, he's alive! Look there! People of Mon Cala, all people of Mon Cala who would not be slaves, have hope. We will fight for you, Prince. You will not be prisoners much longer. Okay, I think the show is over. The guards will be coming. We have to go. Wesa ready. Gungans. The tide has turned in our favor. Let's free my people. Attack! Ani, mesa so happy to see you. Perfect timing, Jar Jar. Whatsa? Mesa can't hear so good since me submerged. Tamson. Tamson, come in. Where are you? The Republic reinforcements are overwhelming our defenses. We must retreat. We must retreat now. I warned you this attack was coming. Where are the Jedi concentrating their attack? There are two groups of Jedi, one, in the lower city center, and two, releasing the prisoners near the coral base. The prisoners! The prince must be with them. I'm committing the reinforcements that Count Dooku sent to the attack. He will not escape this time. Churn them up. Stay in the center, there's less turbulence. Anakin! Skywalker, we've got one chance. Ahsoka, escape with the prince. I'll hold him off. Sever one of the legs. Find the prince! Find him! Now you and I are the only ones left. I'm sorry, Lee-Char. I know what I must do. I know my people need me. I just don't know how to win this war. Look, I know you're scared, but you can't let your fear control you. Aren't you scared? I used to be, all the time, until I realized that if you make decisions out of fear, you're more likely to be wrong. I will unify Mon Cala again, I promise.

Colonel Gascon and his droid squad steal an encryption module needed to crack a Separatist code and stop an impending attack on the Republic. After surviving The Void and escaping the hostile planet of Abafar, our heroes finally appear to be headed in the right direction. Hmm, looks like the Jedi cruiser is expecting this shuttle. Well, I'm sure there's someone aboard who can put this encryption module to good use. Well, soldiers, this is the end of the mission. Colonel Gascon has succeeded. Artoo, contact the bridge. Tell them I request a meal with the captain. Nothing too fancy, and, uh, I don't eat bantha. What do you mean you still can't make contact? I have got a bad feeling about this, Colonel. Something is not right. Snogwash! It's probably just the effects of The Void. All that, uh, magnetic disruption messed up his circuitry. I will not allow your frivolous worrying to undermine this-- this glorious moment! I expect a hero's welcome, not to mention my inevitable promotion to P1 Brigadier! Wow. They really went overboard on the welcoming committee. Good question, Qutee. Why are there not any other shuttles or crew members? Well, everyone's probably preparing to, uh Well, they'll all want to be there when we break the Separatist code. How should I know why all the blast doors are shut? That's a question for the captain of this ship and one I intend to ask just as soon as I find him. Sergeant, Colonel Meebur Gascon. You have no doubt been expecting me. I am delivering the Separatist encryption module. Why--it's just a hologram. What in the blazes is going on here? I do not know. But we just made the jump to hyperspace, which means somebody is navigating this ship. You, droids! What are you doing on our ship? Surrender or you will be destroyed. Battle droids! Whoo--ahh! The commander wants the detonator taken to the control room. Roger, roger. Okay, let me just-- - Lift with your legs! Lift with your legs! Uh, heavy, heavy. Watch it, watch it! Look out! Good thinking back there. But next time I give the orders. Understood? I got it. I got it. I don't got it! Yaah! Uh-oh. I wasn't programmed for this. Stop! Which way are we going? Down here! Aah! Have you seen the intruders? They went that way? Roger, roger. All right, something very strange is going on here. It appears this ship has been hijacked by Separatists. What do you mean it doesn't belong here? He is right, Colonel. This is not Republic technology. Not unless they have lowered their standards. Well, what exactly do you think it is? A bomb? What kind of a bomb? Is it on? How long do we have? Talk to me! What do you mean the ship is a bomb? How can the entire ship be a bomb? Mother of Kwath There must be enough Rhydonium in here to blow up the entire Republic fleet. I don't know what any of this means, but I want off this ship immediately. My mission is over. I had no orders to stop Separatist piracy or disarm massive, titanic-scale bombs! Ceefor has a good point. If we do not stop this ship before it explodes, it could cost the Republic thousands of lives. Pure speculation. We're evacuating this ship, and that is an order! Oh, right. We'll have to wait to evacuate until the ship is out of hyperspace. By then it could be too late. Once we get where we are going, my guess is-- kaboom! Wait! I-- no-- okay, okay! I don't know, Qutee. Where's Artoo gone now? What's going on? Who is this? I am BNI-393, an LEP Servant Droid. My master called me Bunny. And where is your master? He was killed when the Separatists took control of this ship. Why were you hiding from us? At first I did not know if I could trust you. Then I was not sure you would believe me. Once you saw the truth, I was simply hoping you would abandon ship and take the rest of us with you. Rest of you? You're telling me there's more Republic crew members on board? Did you destroy the intruders? Uh, no. There are Republic droids on this ship that could ruin our plans. You will search the entire ship until the intruders are found and report back to me. Is this a joke? The rest of the crew is in our shuttle? I told them to wait inside and that we would be leaving as soon as we came out of hyperspace. You can come out now. It is okay. These are the other crew members? As you can see, none of us can pilot the shuttle, which is why we needed you. Why you need me. Hi, there. I am the pilot. What is this Separatist plot? I do not know the details. I was only able to steal the coordinates of their target. Target? You mean they aren't just planning to blow up this ship? I do not believe so. The coordinates are a space station in the Carida system. What? That's the site of the Republic Strategy Conference. How do I know? I was putting the finishing touches on a report for that conference when I was assigned this mission. The Jedi Council will be there, along with Republic officers from around the galaxy and-- What the The Separatists are going to ram the station with this ship! I agree. We have to do something, Artoo. See if you can send a transmission to the Republic so we can warn them. It is no use. We have tried that. All transmissions from this ship are being blocked. Hmm, you're right. We can't just sit here and do nothing. Where's he going? Uh-oh. That buzz droid is not with me. It must be a spy! Stop that droid! Where'd he go? We've got to find him. I do not know. I do not see him anywhere. Uh, Colonel I think I see him. I think I see a whole lot of him. It's a trap! Good work. You've established a perimeter. There are still more coming! Please tell me you have a brilliant strategy, Colonel! I don't know! There's just so many of them. What do you mean, \"get out\"? All right, what are you going to do? You are going to open the air lock? Are you crazy, Beezee? Everybody, magnetize your feet! Lock down! Beezee! Magnetize! Magnetize! No! Artoo, close the door! Close the door! Poor Beezee. You will be missed, soldier. Artoo is right. Colonel, would you say something to honor this heroic sacrifice? I suppose that's appropriate. I'll have to make it quick because we don't have much time. When this D-Squad started our mission, I had doubts. Grave doubts that we would ever survive, let alone succeed. But we worked together. We didn't give up hope. We showed courage in the face of death. It shocks me to say this, but we make an excellent team. Now we've lost one of our members Beezee. But we must remember. Beezee sacrificed himself for us. That's what a good soldier does sometimes. The only way to honor that sacrifice is to stop this ship and prevent the Separatists from taking any more Republic lives. Are you with me? Have the buzz droids reported back in yet? No, there has been no signal from them. In fact, I cannot even locate their signal anymore. We must assume, then, that the buzz droids have failed. I want those intruders found before they ruin our plans. - Roger, roger. - Roger, roger. All right, everybody knows the plan? We get the injured droids to the shuttle and distract the battle droids while Artoo goes up to the detonator and programs it to explode early. Hopefully he can make it back to the shuttle and we can all get off the ship before it blows up. Good luck, Artoo. The intruders! Destroy them! You can make it! Hurry! Hurry! We have our target in sight. Full ahead. Ramming speed. Evacuation plan is now under way. I will go to the detonator and start the countdown. The worst part about our job are these boring strategy conferences. Cheer up, Anakin. This is your chance to voice all your complaints about military protocol. And it looks as though we can finally get under way. I will inform Master Windu the last straggler has arrived while you work on your attitude. Isn't that ship coming in a little too fast? There's the shuttle! Careful, you'll hit the Rhydonium. Everyone, head to the ship! Ceefor and I will distract them. You are too late. Once the detonation sequence has commenced, there is no stopping it. Now let's see if Artoo made it to the detonator. Artoo is in trouble! Come on! Artoo will never make it back to the shuttle in time. We've got to delay the launch. The cruiser has not slowed its pace. Have you been able to contact their captain? Z9 says he cannot make contact with anyone. Where's Artoo when I need him? We've got to regroup and head back for Artoo. Well, we're changing the plan! No one gets left behind, and we're not leaving until I say so! Prepare for liftoff! No. It is too soon. We are scanning a large amount of Rhydonium on that ship! It's a bomb. And you thought this conference would be boring. Mayday! Mayday! Space station Valor, this is Colonel Meebur Gascon. Can anyone hear me? We read you, Colonel. This is General Skywalker. What's going on out there? Slight change in our mission, General. The droids and I were stowaways on that cruiser. Where's Artoo? I'm sorry to report he was on that ship when it blew up, sir. He just saved all your lives. I want a salvage team out there now! Yes, sir. Artoo! You made it, buddy! Hey, you're a big hero. There's someone here who wants to speak to you. R2D2, are we glad to see you. I am most glad. Quiet, WAC. I'm talking here. Yes, sir, Colonel. In truth, I might just be a map reader, and I don't have much battle experience, but, Artoo, you are the bravest droid I have ever met. You all are. I would be proud to serve with you droids anytime, anywhere. Oh, I am glad to hear you say that, Colonel, because I hear we have been assigned to the same platoon! We will be seeing each other every day for the rest of the war!

Working undercover as assassin Rako Hardeen, Obi-Wan leads a secret mission to uncover the Separatist plot against Chancellor Palpatine. Using cunning and courage, he gains the trust of bounty hunter Cad Bane and criminal mastermind Moralo Eval, earning him entrance to the stronghold of Separatist leader Count Dooku. Now it is here, on the beautiful planet of Serenno, that a barbaric contest will determine the fate of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and, possibly, the Republic itself. Count Dooku, I apologize for my delay. Your careless delay could have ruined my plan, Eval. I see Cad Bane is with you. Who is the other one? This is Rako Hardeen. When Bane's escape plan failed, we only succeeded thanks to Hardeen. I thought he might be useful for the tournament. Enough small talk, I want my money. That makes two of us. You shall have it and perhaps much more. Both of you, if you would like to enter our friendly little contest. I'm in, if he's in. You already owe me for one job, Dooku, anything else will cost you triple. I assure you that if you survive the challenge, the reward will be well worth it. We have all the contestants we need. Prepare the tournament. Yes, My Lord. You summoned me, Master? Wrong to deceive you it was, but much at stake there is. So I was right. Obi-Wan is still alive. Skywalker, a powerful Jedi you are, yet unpredictable and dangerous you can be. To both your friends and enemies. For Obi-Wan, on your patience everything depends. What if he needs our help? Hmm. If you leave, help him you could. But his future, uncertain is. Trust in Obi-Wan we must. So what kind of \"friendly little contest\" you think the Count's got planned? I'd be surprised if we all survive. Nice hat. Where did you get it? What are you looking at? It's a nice hat. Welcome to Serenno. You have been invited here because you are the best bounty hunters in the galaxy. Kiera Swan, two-time winner of the Obsidian Sphere. Derrown, known simply as the exterminator. Sixtat, the Outlands Butcher. Embo, your bounty tallies were second only to one last season. Cad Bane, who needs no introduction. Rako Hardeen, the marksman of Concord Dawn. Jakoli, known for never bringing anyone back alive. Onca, you and your brother have been a legendary team. This challenge may prove difficult for you alone. Twazzi, your acrobatics once earned you praise from Chancellor Valorum. Sinrich, inventor of the holographic disguise matrix. And, finally, Mantu. Your people were once a peaceful race. How far they have fallen. In a few moments, all 11 of you will enter what we call The Box. Some of you will not make it out alive. For those who do, we are looking for the five most skilled among you. Any additional survivors will be eliminated to preserve the integrity of the job that awaits you. Place your weapons here. For those we choose, you will, of course, be paid most handsomely. But more than that, you will be a part of an operation remembered as a turning point in the Clone Wars. And when we succeed, we will bring the Republic to its pitiful knees. Listen up! The Box was designed by me, Moralo Eval, to simulate certain situations that might happen on the job. Go now, enter The Box, if you have the courage. That's it, everyone inside. Keep moving. Before we begin our first challenge, let me say there is only one rule inside The Box. There are no rules. The point, my friend, is to escape and quickly, because only the survivors will advance to the next challenge. Dioxis! Breathe it and you are dead! Every man for himself! That wasn't so hard. The way out isn't up. It's down. The filters in my helmet can protect me for a short time. I'll scout a way out. There's a hole in the floor which gets you below the gas line. Jump down the hole and follow the tunnel. What if he's wrong? You got a better idea? What took you so long? Moralo Eval is impressed. No casualties on the first challenge. I guarantee you that will not be the case in the next. Impressive. I sense something different about that one. Tell me what you know about this Rako Hardeen. He killed the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi. But only with a sniper rifle. Obi-Wan Kenobi? - I know how to get out! Show me. There's a pattern to the blades. Watch, that one's next. If I can time it right, I can climb up to that exit shaft. - Just follow me and time your jump. - Go! Get moving! Hardeen has done it again. I'm beginning to think he may be the best one to lead this operation. Hardeen is crafty, I will grant you, but let's see what happens when he is not the key to their survival. To reach your final challenge, you must pass through my ray shield. The switch to turn it off is on the other side. The syringe on the platform contains a highly electrolytic serum that will allow you to pass through the shield. However, it is toxic to all but one of you. So it would seem. Ahhh! Hey, who put you in charge? Does anyone know what this gas bag is saying? I do. He can get us out of this. He's a Parwan. His blood can take the electrolytic serum. Are you certain? Fifty-fifty. Depends on the blood type of the Parwan. Great. Hurry, use the serum. His blood. How did you know about it? I used to kill Parwans for a living. Your box does not appear to be as much of a challenge as I thought. Perhaps I should put Hardeen in charge of the mission. But this was my plan! You promised me the lead role! You have one last test to change my mind. Do not fear, Count Dooku. I will show you who is weak. The final challenge has arrived. Unfortunately, no. We are going to test your sniper skills. Hit the target. Step back, boys, I'll show you how it's done. I get it. If we miss the target, this platform gets smaller. Soon there won't be any platform left. This is not the first time you've saved everybody's skin, Hardeen. Five more hits. Let's see how good you really are. Oh, what a shame, out of charges. It's also important as a bounty hunter to be lucky, and your luck just ran out. How dare you defy Moralo Eval! If you're gonna kill him, do it like a man. You heard him, Eval. Show us what you are really made of. You're going to have to do better than that! You, my friend, have seen nothing yet! Let's even the playing field. Finish him, Hardeen. Very disappointing. All due respect, I just wanna do my job and get my money. It is unfortunate that your leadership skills are so lacking. And the rest, congratulations on surviving The Box. Tomorrow you will kidnap Chancellor Palpatine at the festival on Naboo. With the leader of The Republic as our hostage, we will demand the release of all Separatist prisoners. If our demand is not met, the Chancellor will be executed. Either way, you will help reshape the galaxy. Once you are all aboard the transport, Eval will walk you through his plan. However, the operation on Naboo will be run by Cad Bane. All of you work for him now.   \n                "}, "Front Runners": {"episode": "s05e03", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tJedi form rebel alliance!

With the help of the Jedi, the rebels escape capture and infiltrated the heavily fortified city of Iziz. Now our heroes have launched an armed campaign to subvert the Separatist occupation of the planet. The Jedi Council continue to observe and advise as the rebels strive to gain momentum against the Separatist forces. Despite the absence of civilian casualties, public fear has ensued as reports of the rebels' daring strikes circulate throughout the city. Your identification failed. That's not possible. You are coming with us. Hey! - What's going on? - No! The rebels are attacking again. That is the fifth time this rotation. That should give King Rash something to think about. Huh, I'm sure you've gotten his attention. Dendup has been summoned and awaits your order, my lord. What about the terrorists? They've attacked a checkpoint near the canal and two droid patrols, one in Malgan Market. If they think destroying a few droids is going to effect change, they've run a fool's errand. One more thing, my lord. The royal carriage was ambushed soon after it left the residence. Hmm, an attempt on my life. It appears that way. Get my predecessor in here. You surprise me. Engaging with extremists is beneath you. Do you really want your crown back that badly? I only want freedom for my people. Hmm. Your supporters are responsible for terrorist acts against the kingdom and our allies. I didn't know that. You've made it quite impossible to stay informed of anything outside my prison chamber. Call off the attacks. I cannot call off what I did not dictate. What you are up against is simply the will of the people. It's up to the king to embrace, bend, or break it. And I am no longer the king. Stop the attacks, or you will atone with your life. It is you that must end the attacks by ending the droid occupation. Your success will not go unnoticed. I agree, but we need to be mindful of public perception. What was your observation, Padawan? The people were fearful, Master. Indeed. Judging from the reactions I saw today, I'm afraid they will mistake your intentions. We need to do more damage. A few dozen broken-down droids will do little to free Onderon. The people need to believe we can succeed. Without their support, our efforts are meaningless. If they're afraid, they won't support us. We need to assure them of our intentions. I don't understand. Why are they afraid? They're afraid we're not strong enough to win. We need to earn their trust. You'll have plenty of time to earn their trust. All of you are going to be very busy. Today was only a taste. You'll get your chance. In the meantime, make the most of your victories. Welcome and learn from them. Perhaps if we hit something big, gave a show of strength, they will overcome their fear and join us. Do you have something in mind? I know the perfect target. I think they're ready to give the 501 some competition. Let's not get carried away, General, though these rebels have impressed me. We will share the developments with the Jedi Council. Ahsoka will remain here as an advisor. Monitor them and report back with their progress. Are you up for it, Snips? Or would you like to return to Coruscant? No, Master. I want to stay. Good. We should continue to provide supplies and credits, but they must learn to operate on their own. Their survival depends on it. Yes, Master. Remember your purpose. This power generator feeds substations across the city. We hit that, the entire grid falls. How does that help us? Battle droids are no longer linked to central control. They operate individually. Yes, but they still need power to recharge. If we take out this facility, it will knock out the power grid, and then it will only be a matter of time until the droid army is brought to a standstill, literally. If you carry the plan out by nightfall, you'll maximize your strike capability. Okay, so we just need to figure out how to destroy the power station. We need to do more surveillance. Those droids should have all the intel we need stored up in those tin cans of theirs, right? They should. Then I'll get us one. Hey, clanker. Uh-oh. Sentries at every access point, inside and out. We can't sustain combat against their numbers. But our size makes us perfect for mobility and surprise. We need something with heavy firepower if we are to blow up this facility. If we give them enough trouble, they'll call for reinforcements. Like a tank. Exactly. Then you can provide cover while we hijack it. And then we use their own weapon against them. And we bring the droid army to its knees. Shh. Remember the plan. We attack this patrol, and hopefully they will call in a tank for backup. Ah! Let's go. Patrol 118 to central. We've been ambushed by terrorists and need reinforcements. Let's hope they send a tank. Hear that? They've sent destroyers. Move! We're not gonna last unless we take out those destroyers. We have to get behind them. Let's go. Roll it slow so it gets through. I know that. Nice job. You screwed me up. Thanks. I've never seen a destroyer taken out that way before. We all have to adapt. There's our tank. Split up. Let's move. Good work. Now, let's get this thing up and running again. What are you waiting for? Give me a second. Do you know what you're doing? Yeah, I know what I'm doing. You boys having a problem? No. No problem. Why? Well, come on. We need to get moving. Hey, who put you in charge? All right. Get out of the tank, hotshot. This needs a woman's touch. Fine. Be my guest. We need to get to that power generator before they realize this tank's gone missing. We're running out of time. I was gonna do that. Uh-huh. Sure. Couldn't have done it better myself. Now, that's the truth. I'll draw their fire. Good luck. Good luck. I'll cover you. We're almost in position. Ready when you are, Steela. A sniper. Get her. Roger, roger. Look. We have reinforcements. Hey, you're not a droid. Get down from there. Fire the gun. The gun is recharging. You're all clear. Looks like all that training is paying off. My lord, without power, the droids will be massacred. This loss will work for us. There's been a power outage. I've lost contact with command. Switch to infrared. Aah! - It's the rebels. - Fight for Onderon! They're destroying the droids! - Free Onderon! - Freedom! Fight for freedom! Get the droids! Freedom! Freedom! For freedom! For Onderon! - Yeah! - Yes! For freedom! For Onderon! Show those droids what we're worth. We must celebrate. With pleasure. Come here, you handsome senator. Steela is a born leader. And quite courageous, I hear. Ahsoka, remember what I told you about staying focused. I can't help it, Master. I understand. You do? I do. But try to remember, always put purpose ahead of your feelings. This latest development will surely get Count Dooku's attention. He will respond harshly. They will stop at nothing to find you. You must adapt and continue to confront them in order to liberate Onderon. We will. And we shall win. In that, I have no doubt. Now you must rally the people. You will need their support. Your ability to influence them will also determine your capacity to represent them not only on the battlefield but off of it against your enemies, even within your own ranks. Your commitment will inspire others. Your conviction will lead to victory. After tonight's efforts, the people will be ready to follow. You will need a leader for them to rally behind. They are waging a very public war. Every trespass is an embarrassment. Your forces cannot manage a small band of terrorists? My lord, your droids have become ineffective against the mounting rebel attacks. I thought I could trust you to rule Onderon. I find this report most disappointing. It seems that the rebels are far more organized than they were in the past. The attack against the power generators proves that. Perhaps it's time you send me better reinforcements than the droids I have. I will grant you this request and not only send you better droids but a better general. This is Kalani. I assure you he will succeed where you have failed. We need to build on our momentum and continue our attacks to keep them off balance. We have to assure the people first. If we keep disrupting their lives, we risk alienating them. We have to gain their trust. I agree with both of you. We can balance both. We also need to recruit others to join us. Onderon is ours. We will remind everyone and keep reminding them until we get it back. - Onderon is ours! - Onderon is ours! - Free Onderon! - Onderon! For Freedom! All in favor of Steela as our leader, raise your hand. Okay. Looks like it's been decided. You're the leader. Saw. Let him go. He just needs to blow off some steam. He'll be back. I can't. Why? He's my brother.   \n                "}, "Evil Plans": {"episode": "s03e08", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA failure in planning is a plan for failure. Evil plans!

Tiny, tiny. - Right away. - Sir? That won't do at all. This is a social gathering for the communal taking of sustenance. Your effort evokes the terror of younglings fleeing a flesh-eating monster. okay then. The garnish! Artoo. I asked you to oversee one thing, and you allow this? Threepio, is there a problem? I'm sorry, my lady, but it appears the dessert is missing its jogan fruit. So go get one. I could not possibly leave now. - Threepio - Fine. Send artoo, then. I'm afraid that may not be the most appropriate idea. It was r2-d2 who put us in this predicament, Quite inadvertently, I'm sure. Please handle this. Okay, threepio, look. - I'm sending you on a mission. - A mission? Yes. Artoo is going along with you. This should be more than enough credits. - If you don't get swindled. - Swindled? Me? Yes, you. Go there. Come back. Don't get lost, and don't get distracted. Of course, master anakin. Come along, artoo. Lost! Distracted! I cannot imagine where master anakin gets these ideas. You are the one who gets distracted. You most certainly do. You wander off like a drunken nuna. I have half a mind to recalibrate your focusing capacitors. There they are. The gold one is the target. Now get down there and do your job. At your service, mr. Bane. Here we are. Now, listen and learn. Excuse me, fine sir, but do you by any chance have jogan fruit? So I have jogan? Can a jedi use the force? I shall take that as a yes. How much would four cost? How much ya got, my friend? Artoo, make sure you watch our credits. My grandpa always told me, \"don't watch your credits. Watch your health.\" So while I was watching my health, Someone stole my credits. My grandpa. A cautionary tale indeed. Might I please purchase four jogan? Your lucky day. Only ones left on the planet. Four credits. Four? That seems fair. Each. I don't need you to tell me what galactic robbery is, But what choice do we have? Very well. We will take them. I meant 32. You said four each. Four times four is 16. You know how it is. Hard times. Very well. You drive a hard bargain. They're leaving. Todo, move into position. I have them marked. As if you could have done any better. Anyway, we still have eight credits left. Which is all you need to revitalize the you inside. Excuse me, but were you speaking to us? No, I'm talking to the you you used to be, that droid fresh off the assembly line, Once so nimble before joints squeaked and wiring frayed. You remember that sparkling fellow? I'm afraid that was a long time ago. - And my friend and I - Could use a makeover, Could you? Well, no. Our master was most insistent that we should not deviate from our task, so this is no time for self-indulgence. Come along, artoo. I said come along, artoo. He's right. You should hear me out. We have no time for this, artoo. but a trip to a maintenance bar would take no time at all. A maintenance bar for droids? after all, why should organics be the only ones who get pampered? They should not. That is why right across the street there is an oasis of pleasure designed to put you back in touch with the original assembly-line you. R2-D2, where are you going?

Yes. I'm never gonna hear the end of this one. Threepio, where were you? You almost missed The whole party. We encountered some complications, sir. What kind of complications? Actually, I have no recollection of my day. I cannot really explain where I have been. Thank you. One, two, three, four. You're gonna have to do better than that, because if padme's dinner is a disaster, then you're not the only one she's gonna be mad at. Anakin, stop worrying. The cake is right here.

An impenetrable defense. Separatist ships blocking the resource rich planet of Christophsis. Trapping Senator Bail Organa and his relief effort. Desperate to aid the estimate Senator, A Republic task force, Under the command of jedi knight Anakin Skywalker, Must break the impass. But time runs short for the Senator. And the good citizens of Christophsis. Separatist forces have overrun our position. And we are out of food, water and munitions. Our situation is desperate. Senator Organa? Senator Organa ! General, another cruiser has been hit. Master Kenobi better get here soon. Or this is gonna be one short rescue mission The command ship is barring down on us. Pull all our shields. Incoming fire. This isn't gonna be easy. Fire all forward canons. Cut off those Republic supply ships. Separate them from their escort cruisers. I smell fear. And it smells good. General. One of the supply ships has been hit. Overfire all reactors. We're gonna blow right past this guy. Whoever he is. General, a republic cruiser is coming out of the hyperspace behind us. Obi-Wan. Looks like General Skywalker's already engaged the enemy. That's nothing out of the ordinary, especially since i gave my direct order not to. The Republic ship is not breaking off its attack. Hold the line. Intensify forward deflectors. Anakin, i want you to withdraw. Withdraw ? I brought a new toy that might give us an advantage. With respect, General, now it might not be a bad time to regroup. Tell the transports to fall back to Obi-Wan's position. We'll cover their retreat as they escape behind the moon. I don't like this. I hope Obi-Wan knows what he's doing. They are escaping. - Should we go after them ? - No! Our orders are to blockade, not chase. I have won this round. Recycle the shields, And let the canons reset to a full charge. Rodger, roger. And the enemy will soon return. And when they do, we shall be ready. Well. Here I am. - Tell me about this new weapon. - You're looking at it. I'm looking at what ? Two steps forward and you'd actually be kissing it. It's a stealth ship. That's some trick. Let's the Separatists think so. So I assume scanners can't detect it. As far as we know, but this is the first real field test. That's encouraging. I figured you'd be up to the challenge. So, I can move in undetected and take them out from behind. That's pretty small ship to destroy a whole fleet. - Are there more ? - No. This is the prototype. And you won't be on the offensive. I need you to run a mercy mission down to the planet surface. The ship can carry enough supplies for Senator Organa's headquarters. Oh, I 'm still the delivery boy? We don't need the whole fleet. I can do this myself. Anakin, slow down and do what I tell you. It's more important to save lives than destroy ships. I need you to continue the mercy mission. Impossible. It can't be him. - Tell General Skywalker to hold this departure. - Yes, Sir. Thank you for waiting, Sir. I'm sorry to hold you up. No apologies, Admiral. What have you got ? Something about this morning's engagement struck me as familiar. - So, I I did a bit of research. - And? I believe the opposing commander is none other than Admiral Trench. If I remember my military history, Wasn't he vaporized at the battle of Malastar Arrows? That's what i thought too. But the tactics employed, The efficiency of the droids maneuvers and then there's this. The last time i saw that symbol, Let's just say I lost a lot of good men that day. What do I need to know ? I have seen his work first hand. A corporate fleet was blockading Malastar, a fleet led by Trench. That's why I recognized the tactics. He tore our ships apart. We barely escaped with our lives. In the end, the Jedi led task force moved in to settle the matter. Trench's ship was destroyed and we assumed he went down with it. Are you sure it's him? It's possible. Not every captain goes down with their ship. Well. We may be in luck, then, Admiral. My orders are not to engage Trench. Just to deliver supplies to Senator Organa. With all due respect, General, I do not believe we will have a choice in the matter. If it is indeed Trench, he will come for us. Us? Yes. I'm voluntaring my services as consultant, General. Welcome aboard. Hurry up, Lucky, we're leaving. CT1284, Spoke. Reporting for duty, Sir. We lost one of our starling line-up, kid. You ready to step up and take his place? Yes, Sir. Just show me my station. You'll be sitting right across from me. Where I can keep an eye on you. Till you're up to speed. Everyone's on board, we are go. Dispatch, we are powering up and ready to go. Going silent in ten. - System screen. - Power core steady. - Double scanning for - Engage cloaking device. Doesn't look like they can detect us. Yes, but if you get any closer, They may not need scanners to know we're here. Relax, Admiral. Hey, you wanted to command this, right ? I can not calculate why the Republic fleet has not launched another attack. What is their status of the assault on Chistophsis ? Resistance is crumbling, Sir. I would estimate a half rotation before it is over. We need to add some pressure on those who were sent to rescue our enemies on Christophsis. Send the Hyena bombers to hit Senator Organa on the surface. That should draw those cowards out from behind the moon. General, we have incoming bombers with fighters escort. Enemy ships closing 15 000, What's our defensive capability ? Torpedoes and anti-aircraft canons, Sir. We'd have to decloak to use either. Yea, and if they don't know we're here, that'll give our position away pretty quickly. Have they detected us ? Can't tell, Sir. If we are going on the offense, we must do it soon. 5 000. Stay cloaked. Power everything else down. Let it drift. - They're going to hit us ! - 500 They missed us. They don't know we're here. They're heading for Bail Organa in the command center. They're going to bomb it. Sir, we have incoming bombers. Get me General Kenobi. We are under attack by the separatist fleet. They came by air and by ground. We can't hold out any longer, there is little chance of surviving. Help us, General Kenobi. You are our only hope. Get me Anakin. Anakin, I've just spoken to the Senator. They're in dire need of our help. Continue with your mission to the planet surface. I will engage Trench's fleet with the ships I already have. General Kenobi, with all due respect you do not have the resources to engage Trench openly. He wants you to attack. You'll be walking into a trap! He's right, Master. You won't stand a chance. Anakin, I've got enough problems without you becoming one of them. Get those supplies to the refugee camp I'll worry about Trench, just stay on course and-- That tactic won't work. Prep torpedo tubes one through four, fix range on Trench's command ship. Sir? You heard me, Admiral. What are you doing? We need to destroy Trench. And this ship has the best chance to do it now. I want those supplies on the surface, now. Don't worry, I'm on it. Anakin. The Republic fleet is holding position. This is unusual. What can they be planning? Prepare to de-cloack on my command. Prep torpedo tubes one through four, fix range on Trench's command ship. I thought we were on a release mission. You'll learn pretty quick when you serve under General Skywalker you're always on the offensive. Now, get ready to cycle those shields. You realize our torpedoes might not be enough? All I want, is for Trench to think about us instead of the people on the planet below. It's time to introduce ourselves. - Activate the thermal charges. - Release torpedoes safety. Ready to *** power. Shield regeneration on stand-by. Something odd is going on out there. Ready torpedoes. Lock on to primary target. Disengage cloaking device. There! A cloaked ship! Fire! Torpedoes locked and closing. Activate the shields. Foolish republic scum. Your putty torpedoes are no match for my thermal shields. Prepare to fire! All cannons! Well, that did little good. Re-cloaking in 9 - 8 - Fire! Pilot, prep the flares. Too late, General! Launch flares. And cloak. Fire a spread of lasers! Incoming! I see it. Scans are coming up negative. We missed. Yes. But we have learned something. No clone can successfully flight through that many lasers. We are dealing with a Jedi. Patch me into the comm channel. Open frequency. - What you got, Spark? - There's a open communication signal - coming from the enemy. - Better tell the General. Now that they know we are here, what's you plan? I'll think of something, Admiral. In the meantime, I've got Trench right were I wanted it. - Thinking about us. - General there is a transmission on the open frequency - It's the enemy. - Put it through. Hello, ugly. I am Admiral Trench. If you are listening, Jedi you've made a bold move and a grave mistake. I appreciate your decision to face me ship to ship To play this little game. It's been so long since I had a worthy opponent. You have an impressive new vessel. But I warn you I have dealt with its kind before. Your technology will not save you. And your friends on the planet below shall perish. As a result Of your failure. The people of Christophsis and her resources Shall join the separatist alliance Turn back now Retreat while you can. Or I am your doom! He said he's dealt with this kind of ship before. How? I calculate the Jedi will not turn back as you request, Admiral. Of course not. I do not expect him to. He'll attack again. A stealth ship could have passed our blocking easily. This Jedi chose to attack. You are right, Admiral. There are records of Trench's battles  And a few against ships with cloaking devices. - And? - It seems in each case he used tracking torpedoes that hit the ships somehow whether it was cloaked or not. Then he knows a way of detecting us. Tracking torpedoes. - What class ship was he fighting? - Mostly cruiser to cruiser, Nothing as small as your ship. No ship this small usually has a cloaking device. Maybe he's tracking the magnetic signature. Thanks, Obi-Wan. Hold off your attack until we destroy Trench. Might I remind you that this was not your mission? You might. Admiral! Prepare to disengage cloaking device and fire. At your stations! Engineering check. Navigation check. - Guns check. - Torpedoes check. Shield check. Admiral, we are ready and waiting. Your move, general.. Fire! There she is! Recloaking in 5 4 Sir? Four or more Republic torpedoes armed and closing. Lock us unto that ship's magnetic signature. Magnetic signature locked. Arm tracking torpedoes and fire them on my command. But, sir We cannot fire unless we lower our shield. Lower shields andfire! Lower shields General, I really hope you know what you're doing. So do I, Admiral. They are turning around. General, cloaking device is active, But they locked unto our magnetic signature. It took the bait! Turn off the cloaking device. Revert all power to the engines. He has headed right for us. He can't! Raise the shields! We cannot. The shields are still charging. - That's the way, yes! - We did it! I hate to admit it, but Good job, Anakin. We are beginning our attack on the separatist fleet. Have fun. I'll be delivering the supplies to the surface, master. General Skywalker! I have no idea how you did it, but you saved a great many lives today. Good job, kid. Looks like you are now officially part of the crew. Thanks, Commander. Well, looks like we make a pretty good team. I must admit I am a bit surprised at the reckless nature of your tactics. Though I cannot argue, it had results. You'll find I like to do things Differently. From time to time. Indeed.

But there is nothing we can change that has already occurred. Say it aloud before this gathering, as representative for Chancellor Palpatine, that you declare without reservation the Separatist State legitimate. I have something to say about the legitimacy of the Separatists. Why is Lux Bonteri here? What could he possibly have to say? He was not invited. You didn't mention that Lux Bonteri would be here. I didn't know. I stand before you, son of Mina Bonteri, loyal Separatist, a patriot, a friend. It has come to my attention that my mother was murdered by Count Dooku in cold blood. That is a lie! Remove this traitor immediately. I will not be silenced. Stop this! We would ask you to respect that we deal with this matter ourselves. No! Dooku is deceiving you. You will all be betrayed just like my mother. I apologize for such a rude interruption. Please let us continue. We can't just let them take him. He'll be killed. Do what you can, Ahsoka, but be discreet. Those are some rather strong accusations you have levied against me. You know what you did, Dooku. Do I? I've done a lot of things, young man. And choose to remember them in order of importance. The death of your mother seems to have escaped me. I will have my revenge. I think it is time we reacquaint the young senator with his mother.

Bring Bonteri to Coruscant immediately. We'll discuss giving him amnesty. Yes, Master. - I can't go with you, Ahsoka. - What? I told you, I have a plan. Shooting me is not going to be part of it. What are you doing with a gun anyhow? You're not a fighter. I'm no longer a Separatist either. I won't join the Republic. What other options do you have? There is a different way. I understand everything that you've been through. I understand you feel alone. But the Republic will help you. Like they helped my mother? I've already made contact with a group on Carlac who are noble and are allied with my cause. And what cause is that? To kill Dooku. The only one you're going to get killed is yourself. I'm sorry, but I'm taking you to Coruscant. You're plan hasn't exactly been well thought out, Lux. Without me, how did you think you were going to escape those droids? Like this. I'm sorry, Ahsoka. It seems Ahsoka is quite exhausted. She probably should sleep it off. Lux? Where are my lightsabers? Lux! Artoo, take a look around and see if you can find where Lux hid them. I'm going to have a little chat with Mr. Bonteri. Lux! Lux, where are we? And what did you do with my lightsabers? You should've stayed on the ship. Hey, kid. You're late. Death Watch. Did you get us what we need? Yes, I have the information with me. Who's this? I'm his I'm his betrothed. Right. Right. Betrothed? Little skinny, isn't she? She serves her purpose. We leave now. The snow is coming. What have you gotten us into? It's all under control. These are the Death Watch. They're Mandalorian terrorists. - They'll kill us both. Are you coming? Yes. Uh, I should stay with the ship. No. You're coming, too. The boss will see you in there. Don't ruin my plan, okay? Plan? What plan? This is a holotrace device. It can identify the origin of any holo transmission. I knew if I accused Dooku of murder, I would be brought to face him. Well, it worked. And I now know Dooku's exact location. If Death Watch moves quick enough we can destroy him. Is that enough of a plan for you? This is not some idealistic political group! They will take the information and kill you. I knew you wouldn't understand. The Death Watch are murderers! Sworn to destroy Jedi. You don't know what you're doing! This Am I interrupting something? No. Of course not. We were just It's time to talk business. Tell your woman to leave us. Of course. Now, give me what I want. When I know that you will use it correctly. Don't toy with me, boy. You see this scar? It was a parting gift from Count Dooku. If you question my resolve to destroy him again, I will give you one just like it. This device will tell you his location. Good. That was painless, wasn't it? Now, let's celebrate. Repair these droids so we can use them for target practice again. Please reassemble us. We are battle droids no longer. Now we are slaves. Please reassemble us. Try that again and I will You don't want to make them angry. They are far from rational. Believe me, you have no idea. - What's your name? - Tryla. I'm Ahsoka. Where are you from? We were kidnapped from a nearby town. We are a simple people. We trust easily. And we were betrayed. We feast. Prepare the food. Your masters are hungry. Hungry? Careful not to choke on your stupidity. I see your woman has fit in well. Now, how will you fit in? All I want is Dooku dead. Vizsla. Chieftain Pieter, I don't remember summoning you. You have taken our women, stolen our food and threatened us for too long. Brave for you to come here with such bold words. You are no longer welcome here. Well, if our presence here isn't welcome, we'll make ready to leave. And you'll return our people to us? Yes, sunrise tomorrow. You have my word. Very well. We'll be waiting. You see? They're not the butchers you make them out to be. You have kept your word. We are very grateful for your understanding. I am a man of my word. Here is your granddaughter, as promised. - No! - Tryla! Kill them. Kill them all. No! Our village. Run for your lives! Save them, Ahsoka. Save them. Save my people. Why? What are you doing? Never let the weak tell you what to do. Welcome to Death Watch. Now what do we have here? I think we've caught ourselves a Jedi. Drag her back to camp. Thank you, friend. How can we repay you? Rescue your friends. How? I compute. I will prepare the others. Now, Lux Bonteri, this does not look good. This does not look good at all. I asked you to join us in good faith and you bring a Jedi into our camp. She wasn't meant to be here. Please let her go. I'm afraid that's not an option. I believed you had honor, but you're just murderers. No better than Dooku. You call us murderers? And yet it was your own lust for revenge that made you seek us out. I wanted justice for my mother's death. And you shall have it. But the Jedi are no different from Dooku and this one shall pay in part for their crimes against Mandalore. So you see it's not murder at all. It's like you say. It's justice. Ahsoka, now! Thanks, buddy. Stop! The Jedi is mine. Lux, get to the ship. I guess Artoo made some friends. Not bad, Jedi. I didn't miss. Ahsoka! Don't let them escape. That's two I owe you. No one followed us. God job, Artoo. What do you mean the escape pod has been activated? Lux! Artoo, the ship is yours. Lux. Lux, what are you doing? I can't go with you, Ahsoka. You know that. But we can try Try to change things together. We make a pretty good team, don't we? Don't worry. We'll meet again. I promise. Be careful, Lux.   \n                "}, "Bound for Rescue": {"episode": "s05e08", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tPiracy in deep space! Infamous outlaw Hondo Ohnaka attacks a Jedi transport carrying six younglings who just received their lightsaber crystals. So rare are these crystals that Hondo knows he can sell them on the black market for a small fortune. In a desperate attempt to save the younglings, Ahsoka Tano is captured by Hondo and his pirate horde. Now, with a damaged ship, the younglings are stranded and alone. This is the Crucible calling the Republic fleet. Come in please. We need help. This is General Kenobi. We have your transmission. The General Kenobi? The pirate Hondo has attacked and severely damaged our ship and taken our chaperone, Ahsoka Tano. I'm dispatching Commander Cody to bring you back. We shall deal with Hondo on Florrum. Will Ahsoka be all right? Hondo would be even more of a fool than I think he is to hurt her. Once we've picked you up we'll focus on rescuing Ahsoka. But we could help Ahsoka a lot sooner than you can. You've shown great bravery, but these pirates-- It was us who managed to drive them from the ship. You will not jeopardize your safety trying to her heroes, understood? Yes, Master. Their coordinates put them dangerously close to Florrum. I do not want them getting any ideas. You will need to leave quickly, Cody. Sir, enemy fleets coming out of hyperspace. Battle stations. Launch all fighters. Cody, looks like you're staying here for now. Heh, what do you think? I think you've finished your lightsaber. Doesn't mean you know how to use it. Well, if you hurry up with yours, maybe we could find out. I'll finish mine when I'm ready. Seeing as how our rescue party has forgotten us, you'll have plenty of time. They probably just got delayed. Delayed? Ahsoka needs our help, and we're sitting around like children. We are children. I vote we mount a rescue mission. Gungi is with me. Byph? That's three votes for and-- One against. Perfect timing. There's a problem with the ship. What kind of problem? Breaking away from the pirate ship ruptured the entire filtering system. What does that mean? It means she's venting coolant, and if we don't land soon, the engines will explode. We'll have to land and let the system reset. Then it's settled. If we stay out here we'll die. We go to Florrum, let the engines cool, and rescue Ahsoka. A rescue mission? It would be wise if you would let me go. No, it would be unprofitable if I would let you go, and why would I do something as shortsighted as that? If you don't let me go, you will wish you had been born a protocol droid. Sometimes I do anyway. But you are really in no position to make threats, young lady. You look stressed. Are you thirsty? A drink, perhaps? Ah, ah, ah, ah. Sorry, but I do not like to share. Our forces are being overrun. The droids are sending out boarding parties. We must get to the main hangar to repel them. We're being overrun! Push forward! Kenobi. You'll regret that. Florrum. Guess we're in the right place. Artoo, finish reassembling Master Huyang, will you? I hate to see him like this. Ganodi, you stay with the ship. And who put you in charge? We're going to need to make a quick escape, and you're the only one that had flight simulator training at the temple. Oh, seeing as you put it like that. I don't see anything. There's no one. Are we sure we even landed near their base? Well, we couldn't land too close, could we? My scanner's indicating a strong power source. Uh, that way. It must be their base. You have no idea how we're going to get inside and find Ahsoka, do you? I'm working on it. Byph is right. We better get moving. We'll figure out a strategy on the way. You know the Republic won't pay a random for me, and the Separatists can't be trusted. They'll betray you and kill us both. Yes, I know this, my dear. The Separatists are no friends of mine. Don't ask me why, but Dooku holds such a grudge against me since our little \"I held him hostage\" affair. Pah! The truth is, I have my sights set on more nefarious criminals than I, a businessman who will pay handsomely for a Jedi-- a female Jedi at that. You don't scare me, Hondo. Ooh! Oh, by the way. The don't care if you're dead or alive. I mean, I prefer alive. Less messy. But I find my moods so changeable these days. Ooh! General, the fuel barrel! Right. Fall back. Fall back! This is General Kenobi. Abandon ship. Abandon ship! Sir, shouldn't we stay and fight? We can't lose the ship now. Cody, the ship is already lost. We must face it. But you and I are going to give Grievous a little parting gift. A ship? What kind? The side of the ship says, \"Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder.\" They're a traveling carnival act. Faster, you lazy creatures. Faster! Oh, Hondo will be furious if we're late. You hear me? Hey, hey. You, there. What are you doing? I said faster, not stop. Sir. Are we to understand you are on your way to the pirate stronghold? Yes, what's it to you? Who are you? How did you get out here? Sir, our ship crashed and we've been stranded, but our misfortune is to your benefit. Oh, really? And, uh, how is that, my curious friend? We are acrobats! Entertainers. We would love to join your act and travel with you to your next destination. Really? All of you wish to join my act, huh? Right. You would like to come with us when we go to entertain Hondo and his pirate horde? Very much so, yes. Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry. The pirates are an unforgiving audience. I couldn't possibly-- What-- How did you-- Oh, my, my. Artists, true artists! Young man, how many of these tricks can you do? How many do you want? Oh, ho, ho, welcome to the show! General, we have secured the ship. Excellent. Waste no time, and get me every last piece of information from the data banks. General Grievous, you have defeated me and taken control of my ship. Congratulations. However, if you are watching this message, that means I'm boarding an escape pod and shall soon be safely away from the ship which is about to self-destruct. General Grievous, you have defeated me Sir. Ah! Wah! Wait, wait! What are you doing? Uhoh. Uh oh. I'm afraid the younglings are now on their own. Preigo. You'd better know what you're doing, because I don't see Ahsoka. Patience. I, Preigo, your humble servant, have searched far and wide, oh, illustrious plunderer of the universe, and found you a most special entertainment. Good. I would hate to be forced to cut off their heads like I did you last act. You remember those guys. You are a brave man to come before me again. Look. He has Ahsoka's lightsabers. I'll get them. Where is my Jedi? I would hate for her to miss the show which I'm hoping will be better than last time. Excellent. Let the show begin! Ah, yes, of course. May I present the, uh, Animal Instincts. Oh, no. I love a kiddie act. What is this business? I believe he wants you to, uh, be a part of the next stunt. Oh, does he now? Come with us. Which one of you said that? I may not be as young as I once was, but I'm older! Stand right here. Who wants to see Hondo's moves? Talk to me, hey! You guys shouldn't be here. Don't worry. We have a plan. I think. I'm flying! Ah! What the-- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not again. Oh! Ah. Well, that was a good act. It's those bleeding Jedi kids. What? The children are Jedi? Oh! Get to those speeders. We've got to run for it! Those blasted kids have screwed everything up! Hondo's going to kill us. Quick, get to that speeder. Get us out of here! What is going on? Where's my Jedi? Someone stop them! Hurry, Gwarm, get after them! Ah. I know how you feel. You lost your master, and I lost my Jedi. Ugh. How do you feel? Better now. I could pretend to be angry, but you were all very brave. Thank you. We disobeyed orders. Well, I've learned from my Master that sometimes doing the right thing means bending the rules. Ganodi, come in please. Get the ship ready.

As battles rage across the galaxy, more worlds had come to the seductive lure of the Separatists and leave the Republic. On a vital mission of peace, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala journeys to Outer Rim world of Rodia desperate to ensure its loyalty remains to the Republic. Senator Amidala, I just received words that you have ventured through enemy territory into the Outer Rim Senator Farr requested me personally, Chancellor. His planet is in crisis. His people are starving. He's a very old family friend. I could not refuse his plea for help. I understand, but in these dangerous times, you should be accompanied by a clone escort. This is a mission of peace. I put my faith in diplomacy. We can't solve all of our problems by throwing troops at them. Yousa no needing to worry, Chancellor. - As resempative of Nab - Jar Jar, look out! What is happening? May I recommend that only those who are qualified for these delicate peace talks participate in them. I will follow your advice, Chancellor. Thank you. Lookee, lookee, it's a swamp planet just like home. Meesa have to get going. Jar Jar, you would be doing me a great favor by staying with the ship. Meesa knowing meesa be big help with the negotiations. I need you to watch over 3PO. You know how he always gets himself into trouble. Trouble, me? Really. I won't be long. Meesa understands, My Lady. His Excellency, Ah-Twa. I've missed you so much. I was afraid you might not come. We are such a small and humble system. Uncle Ono, you are very important to me. We've been friends since I was a little girl, when you were my father's strongest ally in the Senate. Rodia is very important to the Republic, and of course I'd come to help you. You speak of friendship I have not witnessed of late. Where was the Republic when our supply ships were destroyed by pirates? Where was the Republic as my people starved? We have been stranded out here without any help at all. I know it is not your fault, but my people starve all the same. I'm sure the Republic Senate will approve a relief effort. The vote was postponed, but you will get your food. I am sorry. It is too late, my sweet. The Separatist leader Nute Gunray has promised to support us with a very generous relief effort. He is giving us food, ships, and protection. Nute Gunray cannot be trusted. He will bring war to your system just as he did to mine many years ago. I am afraid I have already done what I must for my people. Viceroy, I should have known. You won't get away this time, Senator. Your friend made a deal with me, and you are part of it. 3PO, come in, 3PO. - Stop her. - Three No one can help you now. I am so sorry, my sweet. I had no choice. There's always a choice. - To live in fear is no life at all. - Take her away. Please, Uncle Ono, don't do this. You have made a wise decision, Senator. I will be there within the hour to bring food for your people and collect my prize. How rude. I'm afraid the local swamp life doesn't have a very high opinion of us. - Whaten dey speaking? - I couldn't possibly repeat it. Theesa swamp dwellers just like meesa. I will convince them of our good fellowship. Do be careful, Jar Jar. I don't think they're quite like your friends on Naboo. Meesa make contact. Oh, dear. I don't think that requires translation. Thisen is a different swamp altogether. Sorry. Oh, my stars. Battle droids. Weesa in trouble now. Stop where you are. Wait for me! Jar Jar, you great webfoot, you're squashing my circuits. Blast 'em. Wait, where are you going? Oh, no. I'll be crushed for sure. - Hang on, Three-so! - It's 3PO. That was close. What are you doing? Get me down at once. It's not too late. Uncle Ono, you can stop this madness. Keep moving, prisoner. Look out, Jar Jar. A crab droid is headed right for you. Headed for meesa? Yes, yousa! No, Jar Jar, go to your left. Behind you. Watch out. I can't bear to watch. Oh, no. Jar Jar's been killed. I knew something like this would happen. What a horrible way to die, and it's all my fault. He was so brave. Now he's gone forever. Meesa okay. Jar Jar, you're alive. Meesa okay, Three-so. Meesa okay. If you've finished messing around, I need help. - Jar Jar, kindly don't do that. - But meesa save-ed you. That's the end of our ship. Typical. Are those chains necessary? Welcome to the separatist way, Senator. Viceroy Gunray's orders. I hope it's worth it to you. Thisa one big mess. Weesa going nowhere. Perhaps we should try to contact the clone troopers. Lookee. Here's a button that's still working. What did you break now? Meesa doing nothing. Thatsa looken like a Jedi robe. Whosa you supos'n this belongs to? I wouldn't know. But our only hope is to hide in this closet until Mistress Padm\u00e9 returns. If those droids attacking us, Padm\u00e9's probably in trouble. My Lady gave us very specific instructions to remain here. Fiddlesticks. We musta hafta try and saving her. Jar Jar Binks, have you gone completely mad? You'll do more harm than good. Good. I shall meet the Viceroy when he lands. What about Senator Amidala's companions? If there are no signs of her friends, they must have fled into the jungle. Yes, this is perfect. I want no sign of trouble. Our people need those supplies. Wait. Meesa eyeball's stuck in the sleeve. - Just look at you. - Something's wrongo here. The battle droids will surely capture you, or worse, me. Not with thisa on. Theysa won't be recognizing me. - You can't be serious. - Co me on, Three-so, - we can do it. - I have a very bad feeling about this. The citizens of Rodia welcome you, Viceroy. Where is Senator Amidala? Awaiting your arrival as promised. Excellent. I do not wish to keep her waiting. Shall we go? We are holding the Senator in the detention tower. I hope it is not too painful for her. Sheesa up in that tower? Weesa got to rescuing her. And how precisely do you propose to do that? Look, a Jedi. We're doomed. - A Jedi? - Jedi? Where's a Jedi? I do believe they mean you. - Meesa not a Jedi. - Kill the Jedi. Don't shoot. We surrender! Forget surrender! Weesa run! - Is he dead? - The Jedi got away. He slipped through this grate and went underwater. Sound the alarm! Find that Jedi! I can see your busy, so I'll just be going now. And take that Republic droid scum to the dismantling center. Dismantling center? Wait, wait. I'm innocent. I'm innocent, I tell you. Let's find that Jedi. Roger, roger. Take me to Senator Amidala at once! There's a bad boogie monster down there, you betcha. Don't be fearing, Padm\u00e9. Meesa coming. Better watch out. There's a Jedi on the loose. You know, you will soon be destroyed. I can't tell you how many times I've seen battle droids sliced in half by a lone Jedi. Quiet you. All right, cut the chatter. I want you troops to go outside and secure the perimeter. You made it. I'm rescued at last. Hurry before the battle droids figure out what's happening. - Quiet in there! - Thank you. Let's get out of here, Master Jedi. Jedi? There's no Jedi in here. Wait, there's no prisoner in here. How did she do that? Where's the alarm button? I am a protocol droid - fluent in over 6 million forms of - Quiet. Mistress Padm\u00e9. Thank The Maker you're safe. Have you - Where's Jar Jar? - I'm afraid he went to rescue you. - What about the Jedi? - There is no Jedi. It appears the battle droids have mistaken Jar Jar for one. That's not good. Hang on, My Lady. This is our chance to capture Viceroy Gunray, but I need you to stay calm. Go back to the ship and call for help. I regret the transmitters on the ship are out of order. What? - The ship has been destroyed. - Battle droids? All right, then find a communications room and send out a distress signal. Hopefully there're some clone ships within range. I'll track down Jar Jar. Viceroy Gunray, when can we expect the supplies to arrive? My people are starving. They haven't arrived yet? I'm sorry. Your request will be taken into consideration after Senator Amidala's execution. Execution? You can't. She's a prisoner of war. We were promised. You are under my protection now, and you will do what I demand of you. Padm\u00e9 was right. I have made a grave mistake joining with the separatists. I know, I know. We must appease Viceroy Gunray so he does not destroy us all. Be on alert for that Jedi. He is our only hope. Bring Senator Amidala before me. She caused a great deal of damage to our droids, and she escaped, sir. - Escaped? - It's the Jedi! Shoot him! Thisa rescuing is hard jobbing. Capture her! Oh, dear. The Jedi has been spotted in the south hall. - Let's move. - Roger, roger. I think that was rather clever. Sir, over there! The Jedi is escaping. Not likely. Freeze. Surrender. Where did she go? What the Senator Amidala. So good to see you at last. Hello? I say, is anyone there? Why is there never an R2 unit when you need one? This is a restricted frequency. Who is this? I am C-3PO, human-cyborg No droids. This code is for military use only. This is a priority message from Senator Amidala on Rodia. - We require immediate assist - Hold it. - Oh, dear. - You're under arrest. So you didn't find the Jedi, then? You got him, boss. Too bad you can't take out that slug monster. Yousa okay, bogey? Yousa save-ed me. Yousa my new palo. Mistress Padm\u00e9, where you able to find Jar Jar? I think Jar Jar's dead, 3PO. Not again. Oh, poor Jar Jar. He was always such a misfit. I want to make sure this time. Don't do this, Viceroy. I beg you, do not kill her. There must be another way. Silence! I say, I think there has been some horrible mistake. I am a protocol droid on a diplomatic Ready. Aim. It's the Jedi! - It's the Je Juh - Jedi. Release the Senator. That Jedi is going to attack. Shoot him! Shoot them all! That Jedi has summoned a monster. We have to get out of here. I made a very good friend. Hold it right there, Viceroy. At last we can finish this. Onaconda, it is about time. Blast that Jedi and shoot her! Uncle Ono, I think it's time to tell the Viceroy about our little secret, how you never meant to leave the Republic and how you truly care what's best for your people. What is she talking about? Sorry, Viceroy, she is right. I am with the Republic, and you are under arrest. You will pay for this treachery. Viceroy, you are going to spend the rest of the war in a cell. Your victory will be fleeting, Senators. Those are Republic warships. The clones have arrived. We got your message, general. What are your orders? My message got through. Take this separatist scum away. Master Bombad, on behalf of the people of Rodia, I thank you. You're either the bravest or the most foolish Jedi I have ever met. I'm just a gungan, and I don't think I'm either. Well, I think you're a little bit of both. Senator Amidala has brought your people's needs to my attention, and I have already sent a convoy of supply ships to your system. Thank you, Chancellor. The capture of Viceroy Gunray is a major victory for the Republic. All of you should be commended for your courage, and from what I hear, especially you representative Binks. Ah, it'sa nothing. Can you ever forgive me, Padm\u00e9? It is the Republic that should be asking your forgiveness, my old friend. Far too often, we forget that our most important allies are not always the most powerful.   \n                "}, "Conspiracy": {"episode": "s06e02", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA flaw in the plan! While in the middle of a heated battle, clone trooper Tup lost his senses and killed a Jedi General. Seeming to have no awareness of his actions, Tup's health began to deteriorate rapidly. Fearing the illness was linked to a Separatist plot, Anakin Skywalker has dispatched Captain Rex and ARC Trooper 5555 to escort Tup back to the cloning facilities on Kamino for an intensive evaluation. You will have to say good-bye to your friend now. Yes, Doctor. General Shaak Ti. Captain Rex. Fives, am I correct? Yes, General. You've served with Tup? Yes. You must come with me. With with all due respect, General, I can't just abandon him now. You must let the doctors do their work. Do not be afraid. Your friend is in quite capable hands. Doctor Nala Se is the Chief Medical Scientist on Kamino. She was one of the primary engineers of all the clones. Now we must take care of you. Me? There's nothing wrong with me, General. I'm perfectly fine. We can't be sure of that until we've completed a full exam. If a virus was the cause of Tup's breakdown, you have more than likely been exposed to the contagion. You haven't entered the advance stages yet, as Tup has, but any information we can gather from you could help to find a cure for Tup. All right, General, if it'll help Tup. Captain Rex, General Skywalker has ordered you back to the war zone. You are to leave immediately. I'm sorry, Fives. I wish I could stay, but duty calls. It's fine, sir. Fighting a virus is a nice change of pace from all those clankers. Take care of yourself and Tup. Let's begin the tests. Administer the stimulant. Remove his mask. What are they doing to Tup? Remain calm. Out of my way! Oh. Please return to the examination table. His reactions are normal. What's going on? General! General! No, no, no. Please return to the examination table. Come on! Remain calm. Please return to the examin His reaction will subside. The patient must be awake for the next round of tests. I am not fond of these hyper tests. Yes, but they do give us all the information we need in a timely fashion. There does not seem to be any sign of infection in the blood. How curious. The subject has tested negative on all accounts. This clone seems to be in perfect health. We must be missing something. Why am I here? Is he conscious? Follow orders. Kill Jedi. Kill Jedi! Are you finished with your tests? For now. Sedate him. Yes, ma'am. Follow orders. Follow orders. Follow orders. It appears this clone has orders to kill a Jedi. Perhaps the Separatists found a way to brainwash him. Look, is Tup going to be all right? Have they found anything out? Please sit down. We are using hyper tests, so we should be getting the results very quickly. We need to complete more procedures on you. Sorry. Why? Ow! Hey! I said I was sorry. You must understand, organic beings are so much harder to analyze than droids. Well? Everything seems normal. Oh, great. Well, that means they can let me out. I am afraid that is not possible. You must remain quarantined until we have pinpointed the exact cause of the other clone's breakdown. We cannot risk any further casualties. Look, I am not a threat, and neither is Tup. Are you certain? Eh. You're just a droid. You don't know about real duty, about what it's like to have a brother. I am sorry. I always wanted to have human feelings, but I do not. Good-bye. Maybe whatever is causing his aggression is psychological. It seems to be an isolated case. The other clone has yet to display any symptoms. I need an answer now. This isn't just a physical manifestation of psychosis. You must have missed something. Might I suggest a second brain scan, an atomic-level brain scan? This is unnecessary. The phase 1 and 2 scans we did are sufficient. He's too weak for a phase 5 atomic-level scan. I calculate the beneficial knowledge we could gain from a phase 5 atomic scan is worth the risk. The only way to discover what has happened to this clone is to terminate him and do a full-scale autopsy on the molecular level. We must be cautious. I do not believe this is a physical ailment, but a mental condition caused by possible Separatist brainwashing. I do not agree. This is a virus of some kind. I am in charge of this examination, and I will decide what is best for my patient. Actually, since the Republic and the Jedi commissioned the clones, it is our responsibility to oversee their care. Every clone and their genetic makeup is property of the Kaminoan government. Now, as a client of ours, I will respect your wishes, but as to the fate of this clone, I will speak to our Prime Minister, Lama Su. And I will advise the Jedi Council on the atomic brain scan and see how they would like to proceed. Very well. Hello. What's going on? CT-5385's condition seems to be deteriorating. Tup. His name is Tup. Tup? What is a Tup? Tup is my friend. He's not a number. Yes, he is. We all have numbers. My number is AZ-345211896246498721347. His number is CT-5385. Wrong. He has a name. No clone uses a number, not anymore. But you are a number. CT-5555. No, I am Fives. Call me Fives. But five is a number. No, not five, Fives. Oh. The difference is minimal. Not to me and not to any clone. It appears there has been a preemptive execution of clone protocol 66. How did this happen? I do not know as of yet. However, I recommend we terminate the clone and do a full autopsy to discover how the inhibitor chip was activated. And what of the Jedi? The Jedi Shaak Ti is proposing an atomic-level brain scan. She has gone to the Jedi Council to seek their approval before proceeding. We must contact Lord Tyranus. I've been expecting your transmission. I have heard of the malfunctioning clone. How widespread is the problem? It seems to be an isolated incident. However, this is a delicate situation. We need to terminate the clone as soon as possible in order to extract and analyze the inhibitor chip that you provided to us. Very good. Terminate the clone immediately. However, send the chip to me for analysis. And what if the Jedi ask for the chip and the results of the autopsy? You must remember the chip is a safeguard against betrayal from rogue Jedi. Master Syfo-Dias was the only Jedi who knew of this. But with his passing, we alone know of this secret, and you must keep it that way. Yes, Lord Tyranus. These Jedi are a curious cult. Too spiritual for my taste. I will terminate the clone immediately. The Kaminoans have suggested that we terminate the clone and do a rigorous molecular autopsy to discover the virus. I believe this solution is ill-advised. My belief is that Tup has been brainwashed by the Separatists using some new process we do not yet understand. Brainwashing? How could that be possible? General Skywalker reported Tup missing on Ringo Vinda, but after five rotations, he turned up again. That event preceded this episode. Perhaps he was compromised at that point. We must find the truth behind this situation, or we could find many more clones turned against us. I would like to implement a level five atomic brain scan to see if his thought processes are still functioning normally. And what do the Kaminoans think of that? They feel Tup is so weak, the level five atomic brain scan will damage his neural tissue and possibly kill him. Their approach would be to terminate him, thus leaving the brain fully intact for the autopsy. Bring clone trooper Tup back to the Jedi Temple. Yes. Examine him with the Force we shall, and unravel this mystery we will. Yes, Master. I'll bring him back immediately. No. There's too much procedure and protocol here. Tup is a soldier, he risks his life every day, and I know he would risk it now if it meant finding a cure for what's wrong with him. I recommended an atomic brain scan, but that request has thus far been denied. Then we have to get the results of that brain scan ourselves. But that is against protocol. Think about it. It's your duty to save the patient, right? That is correct. And you recommended this atomic brain scan as the best way to save the patient, right? That is correct. So, by not performing this scan, you're letting the patient die, willingly. Impossible. That is against my programming. That's not the way it looks to me. I cannot perform the atomic brain scan without disobeying orders. Check your programming. I thought saving the patient at all costs was fundamentally your highest order. You are correct. Right. Then let's get to it. Quickly. Okay. Let's get to work. The scan is almost complete. Everything appears to be normal. Wait a second. What? What is it? It appears this clone has developed a tumor. Is that even possible? I have never witnessed anything like this in your kind. Then what is it? I cannot be sure without a biopsy. You're gonna take it out of him? What was that? Do you think anybody heard that? The probability that somebody heard that is high, yes. It came from this room. Hello, Doctor. What do you think you're doing? I was only following protocol. Save the patient. Doctor, I have found something unusual in this scan. It appears to be a tumor. Perhaps you should take a look. You performed a second scan without my authorization? As I stated, I was following my programming. Then you are like this clone defective. You will be put on report for deactivation. But the tumor this tumor seems to be blocking neuro-impulses from communicating within the brain. We should scan the rest of the clones to see if this is a problem with their base genetic model or a mutation with the current models. There is no tumor. Your scan is incorrect. But this clone clearly has a virus that remains undetected, but I will find the cause once he's terminated. Now leave. I can't believe it. They're going to kill him. In a case like this, it is the logical course of action. No, no. We were not created to be disposed of this way. Perhaps you were. CT-5385 will be terminated so that others like him could survive. There aren't others like him! Tup doesn't have to die. You found a tumor. I'm sure that's the cause of all this. It's the only thing that makes sense. But how can we proceed? Do your biopsy. I'm sure what you find will prove Tup does not have to die. But Nala Se does not believe We're not going to Nala Se with whatever you find. We'll go to the General, to Shaak Ti. She helped me once as a cadet. I know she values the life of a clone. But we will be disobeying direct orders. Yep, for the second time today. Can you hack into the medical center's mainframe? I do possess that ability, yes. All right. Well, here's what you need to do. It will be a painless death. Soon, all our questions will be answered. You may proceed. Hurry. You got it? Are you in? Got it. Intruder alert. Intruder alert. All nonessential personnel report to a safe room for lockdown. Master Jedi. Status report? Scanners have picked up an intruder in section C-6, but we have no visual confirmation. It could be the enemy looking for our patient. I'm on my way. Please report to a secure room. Ha! Good work, AZ. You better get started before they figure out it's a false alarm. Right away. You might want to turn away for this part. I want a report. It appears to be a false alarm, triggered from the medical bay. Medical bay? It's Fives. Come on. Is it done? It is now. What have you done? We've saved my friend's life. This tumor is the cause of his illness. Give me that! You can't be trusted. Stand down, trooper. General! I have evidence. It's right here. I'm free. The mission Free Tup? The mission Free. The mission. What is he saying? Brother, what mission? You you know the one. The the mission, the one in our dreams that never ends. The one in our dreams Oh, brother. This is the end. Forget the mission. Oh, the nightmare. I'm free. No. No. I thought I saved him. Sir, the clone CT-5385 has died. Such a tragedy. I recommend we do further tests on this tumor at the Jedi Temple to see if it is the cause of the problem. Or even better, have the tumor sent to the Grand Republic Medical Facility here on Coruscant. - The Jedi Council requested the clone. - I think the Chancellor is correct. The Grand Medical Facility is state-of-the-art. If we are to find an answer to this puzzle, we will find it there. - We are in agreement, then? - Yes, sir.   \n                "}, "Senate Murders": {"episode": "s02e15", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tSearching for the truth is easy. Accepting the truth is hard. War on many fronts! While battles are fought by Clones in the field. A different war is waged on the Galactic Senate. As heavy loses add up a group of senators lead by Halle Burtoni of Comino propose an escalation of troop production Senator Padme Amidala, recognizing that more troops will only prolong the fighting. Works tirelessly with her allies to introduce a bill to cut military spending and stop the creation of more clone troopers. Yes of course Senator. Thank you for telling me yourself. I completely understand. Did we loose someone else's vote? Senator Stank is worried about Republic opinion. But he wants us to know how very sorry he is. Sorry doesn't get us votes. We will get votes, when in your speech, you will convince people to stand up for what they know is right. I hope you're right, Uncle. You have been doing an amazing job, rallying votes to our side. Choose cool Senator Farr. Perhaps, I am the most influential man on Rodia, Lolo. But after all the mistakes I've made, peace is what matters to me now. Senator Amidala, they're ready for your speech now. It's time. We will see you in the chamber, Senator Amidala. Good luck, Padme. It is quite exciting. It isn't exactly the word I would use. I think terrifying is more appropriate. Pay her no mind Senator Organa Even as a girl, Padme down played her strengths helps to maintain the element of surprise. I learned it from you. See you inside Senators. The creation of more warriors will not end this war the final cost alone will bankrupt and cripple the Republic. By adding more clones to the conflict, we're only escalating the destruction, not winning the war. Which is why we must vote for this resolution to promote more diplomacy, and to bring an end to this killing, and hatred. That was quite a moment, my dear. Thank you, Senator Deechi. Oh, it wasn't a compliment. You shouldn't make speeches like that. It's unpatriotic. The only thing I find unpatriotic is your war mongering. Truly, you have turned the tide. My dear, you were brilliant. Thank you. But perhaps, we should wait to we actually win the vote before we make a victory speech. What a novel idea. Imagine that. Amadala's actually making sense for once in her life. Senator Burtoni. This is a private conversation. Private conversation or separatist conspiracy? How dare you? We're not pro separatist. We want to end the war. Committing more troops to the front lines will not allow diplomacy to resume diplomacy failed the Republic long ago. Senators, please. Senator Burtoni, the Kaminoans might have bartered their creation of the clones into a seat in the Galactic Senate. But this is not give you free reign. Thank you for visiting, Senator. We would like to continue our meeting now if you don't mind. Enjoy your moment in the spot light Senators. This war will not end soon. Well, we must be doing something right if we've rattled Senator Burtoni. What matters is that we've made great strides in our fight against this bill. I know you've done a wonderful job leading the effort I'm just trying to do what's right. I only wish I'd tried doing that a long time ago. You're doing it now. To victory and an end to this war. To victories. My heart, I can't breathe. Uncle? What is it? Ono! It's his heart! Please! Someone get help! And we are all aware that Ono Condo was a flawed man. He knew better than anyone of his own mistakes. But he never compromised his principals. And what he did, he did for his people. Their needs always came first. Senator, if you need anything. What we need is to get his resolution passed. He was my mentor. I don't know how to carry on without him guiding me. I know. No one could ever take his place. Excuse me. Chancellor Palpatine has summoned both of you to his chambers. What's happened? I'm afraid my friends that Lieutenant Divo here has some questions about Senator Farr. Do you know of anyone who how to put this hated Senator Farr? Enough to kill him? What? I'll need to find out who wanted to hurt Senator Farr Actually kill him would be more accurate. What with him being dead. No one wanted him dead Everyone loved him Well, that's obviously not true or I wouldn't be here, and he would. Lieutenant, even Ono's political enemies respected him we need time to deal with this situation Time, time, there's no time. A murderers on the lose and it's my job to find him. Ahem what makes you think it was murder poison of course the politician's preferred method found a chemical in his blood stream, killed him right away. It's an obvious case. Politicians always have something to hide. And it always come back to haunt them. Am I right? Look who I am asking a room full of politicians so, one of Farr's secrets must have resurfaced Ono had no secrets that's not it perhaps someone was upset about the Clone troop bill currently on the floor. It's very controversial thank you senator Amadala, is it? But I already have my theory and I'll follow my hunch if you don't mind. After all I am the inspector. You are the senator. So I'll handle the inspecting and you can stick to the 'senating'. Good day. Murder. It's inconceivable. Who would wish Ono Conda harm? What if it's the BIM. What if we're all being targeted. Speculation gets us no where there is work to do, we should double our efforts on the vote it'll be even harder with Ono gone. - No, no, we should delay the vote. - but, why? No one will give the vote their full attention until they know what's happened to Ono. Well, maybe I can put a motion on the floor. I don't think anyone will object given the circumstances. Good. And we'll have time to conduct our own investigation. Detective Diva specifically asked us not to interfere. Well he didn't exactly inspire confidence, did he? He didn't know Ono. We did. We'll have a far easier time looking into this than detective Divo will. Running around could disrupt our coalition. Yet you still seem determined to see this through. Indeed I am. And I don't supposed you'd considering bringing - Captain Tyfo along with you? - No. I'd rather do this quietly. Then perhaps sentator Agama, you should accmopany her. I think that's an excellent idea. I don't need a guardian. Of course not my dear. Think of it as precautionary. Don't worry, I won't get yin your way. Very well, I don't have any objections. And I know exactly where to start. You're suggesting one of us killed Ono Conda Farr. - How delightful. - I don't find any of this amusing. - Neither do I. - Every time Ono opened his befuddled mouth, it gave us another quote to use in our fund-raising. Why would we kill our best source of income. You both opposed Ono's ideas in the senate. With enough at stake. Maybe you decided to silence his voice, for good. Ono conda and I, were often at odds, but I respected him. - I respected him greatly. - For the record, I had no respect for Ono Conda what so ever. Ono had a secret meeting at the docks on the direct Major, the night before he died. And you just happened to know about this meeting how? Oh, I was having Ono followed. Just because I respected Ono, doesn't mean I wasn't trying to get dirt on him. Of course. The point is a clandestined off the books meeting under cover of darkness. Perhaps that location holds some clue. Fine, I will go look. But whatever we find, I'll have more questions for both of you. Have I said that I think we're very far out of our element here? Yes, ***, I believed you've mentioned once or twice. You're using this investigation to bury your grief, might not be the best way to I'm not. Then why can't you just leave it to Lieutenant Divo? Padme! Watch out! Senator Amadala, is it possible you might be going deaf? Lieutenant? Because when I said I didn't want you to interfere with my investigation. I can only assume you didn't hear me. I had some information about a lead here at the docks. Which you naturally brought to me straight away so I could investigate only no wait.. you did exactly the opposite of that. There are rules, senator. My friend was murdered. I don't care about rules. Don't care about rules? My dear, without rules there's only chaos. Everyone must care about rules. We know that. But now you've alerted the killer that you're on to him. And my investigation is that much harder. Do you have any idea how many reports I'll have to file now. We alerted the killer. Yes, that is what I'm saying. What if we were sent here on purpose. To the docks? Yes! What if this was all a setup. What if Dechee sent us here just so he could kill us. If we hurry we might still be able to catch Dechee before he leaves the senate. Agreed! But wait, I'm still investigating. This is still an active crime scene, you can't Oh, fine. Senator Dechee, I'm sure you're surprised to see me, after what you. Oh! he's dead. He's been stabbed. This is definitely going to require another report. The killer is obviously targeting the leadership. You must stay here under my protection. Why? so the keeler can take us all out at once? Oh, that's preposterous. Even if the killer did get through my security, it's very unlikely that all of you would end up dead. We are far to easy a target sitting here. I am leaving. No you can't leave Lolo. I think in this instance, the Inspector is right. Out of my way. Who else knew you were going to the docks. Just Senator Bertoni. She was the only other one in the room with us. Bertoni, eh? Sir, Senator Bertoni is not here. Ah! Looks like that long necked Kaminonan has flown the coop. It's been a difficult time. You've handled yourself well. I had to try. Ono believed if you see injustice, you can't wait for someone else to fix it. You must stand up and get involved. He did. Help, I have been attacked. She's over there. She tried to kill me. What happened? Senator Bertoni. She jumped me. She's in the east wing corridor. Hurry! Guards go. You're insane. I didn't kill anyone. Last thing I remember, I was walking to my office. Then I woke up here. Senator Lolo has a very different story. She says you attacked her. Attacked her? Lolo? If I ever attack someone I hope it will be someone mildly important. Someone like Senator Farr? Ono was a harmless bug. I wouldn't bother killing him. And Dechee was my ally. I've been thinking about how you were in Senator Amadala's office right before Farr died. So what? And I've been thinking about how you were in Dechee's office to hear about the meeting at the docks. A meeting I think Farr has with you. It wasn't me. You have no proof. No? I have this. I ordered an extensive forensic report on Farr as soon as he died. The poison which killed Farr only affected Rodian blood. And it was developed by Kamonian scientists. But that's I didn't kill him. You're Kamanoain. You had access to the poison. That's motive, means, and opportunity. Guards! But the scan must be wrong. If the poison was in all our drinks. Lolo would have died too. What? She's Rodian. She'd have been poisoned too. Unless she didn't drink. But you drank, right Lolo? Lolo, you didn't drink. Did you? You're right, I should have pretended to drink. Alright, You're coming with me, for insurance. Why did you kill Ono? He brought war to my planet. No, he made a mistake, Lolo. Which everyone seemed to forget, including you. I didn't. Did you honestly think he had the moral right to lead us? After he betrayed us? He was sorry! He was weak! We needed someone of strength to stand against this war. I tried to scare him at the docks. But he wouldn't go away, so I removed him. And then I heard Dechee heard about the meeting. He had to go too. Halt! Put down your weapon. With the final votes tallied. Let it be known that the motion to stop the the creation of more clone troops has failed. And the continued manufacturing of clone troopers shall proceed as scheduled After all that. We lost. I know this decision was most unexpected. I myself don't support it, but, democracy must stand. Of course, you were right chancellor. Actually, given recent events perhaps it is for the best. How can we justify fortifying our security here in the senate. If we don't also provide reenforcement on the front lines. You see, the victory of the clone army, for now, is the only thing that can lead us to peace.

Republic forces struggle to take Umbara, a hostile planet completely enshrouded in darkness. Jedi General Pong Krell and Captain Rex lead a battalion against a constant attack by a brutal enemy. Krell's aggressive and reckless strategies backfire, killing many clones. Despite the Jedi General's dangerous tactics, Captain Rex's squad successfully captures a critical airbase. This further fuels the mistrust of Krell's leadership, dividing his men. The insurgents have stepped up their attacks, sir. They want their base back. We cannot let our guard down for a moment. Have all Umbaran security re-configured and locked down. Interrogate the prisoners if you have to, but I want this base under our complete control and I don't want excuses. Sir, there's a transmission from General Kenobi. I'll take it in the tower. Hey, how's it coming? Tricky piece of hardware. Krell's got Jesse stacking ordnance. I'm still waiting for Krell to thank us for handing this base over to him. Where is he? General Kenobi, do you read me? Congratulations on your capture of the Umbaran airbase, General. It's refreshing to have good news. There will be time for celebration when we've taken that capital. Yes. Well, I'm afraid that's going to be more difficult than anticipated. Their attacks have increased and their long-range missiles are forcing us to retreat from our positions. I was hoping we cut off their arms shipments and supplies when we took this airbase. It seems they're receiving new arms shipments directly from a supply ship orbiting General Kenobi? We've been having difficulty transmitting They must be jamming our signals. Can't we destroy the supply ship? We're trying, but with little success. Their fleet outnumbers ours and the extra ships we were promised have not yet arrived. We'll just have to take that capital regardless of the missiles. My battalion will meet you at the rendezvous coordinates. We cannot expect I'm trying to get him back, sir. Don't bother. The enemy is jamming our transmissions. We are on our own. Have those containers searched and all weapons prepped and loaded. Have the battalion ready to move out in 12 hours. We're advancing on the capital. Sir, shall I try to get a message to General Kenobi? Shouldn't we coordinate our attack, especially in light of the recent threat? General Kenobi has his hands full, same as us. We need to throw everything we have at them, now! We'd be marching into a blast zone, sir. Blasted insurgents. I realize you haven't agreed with all my strategies, Captain. But you are smart enough and loyal enough to obey my orders. Now, prep those troops! Those missiles have 100 megaton yield. We won't even make it to the delta. What can I do? I've tried to reason with him. Those are the orders. Great. Another suicide mission. The capital is too well armed. Why does it seem like he has it out for clones? I think you're all overreacting. Obviously, General Krell knows what he's doing. Do you really think he doesn't care if he loses men? I'm not saying that. But I do think his desire for victory has blinded him to the fact that there are lives at stake. I've never seen a general with these kinds of casualties. He's out of control! He's not acting like the other Jedi. He has no respect for us. Listen, I don't agree with him either, but I don't have a better plan. What about using these starfighters to destroy the supply ship? Our fleet has been trying. The Umbarans have it as protected as the capital. But we've got their access codes and their own hardware. You were able to crack it? Mmm-hmm. We can sneak right past their blockade, get where our ships can't. If we take out that supply ship, then we cut off arms to the capital. Sir, with all due respect, might I suggest another option to help us secure the capital? What would that be, Captain? My men have cracked the Umbaran codes. With the starfighters, we can sneak past the supply ship's defenses. We take it out, we cut off the arms to the capital. And who do you propose would fly these starfighters? Are your troops now pilots? My men may not be pilots, sir, but they are able to learn and adapt quickly. A few of them have already demonstrated that. I'm afraid I can't afford to waste any clones on frivolous adventures. We're going to need everyone to take the capital. Sir, incoming. Sector delta. Long-range missiles. The assault on the capital will continue as planned. So that's it? We just march into those missiles? Oh, there's another option. We go ahead with our plan, and suffer the consequences. You would be court-martialed. If it were up to me, and we had the time and the training, I would say, \"Do it.\" But it's out of my hands and the truth is, you are no pilots. Come on. If Hardcase can fly one of these things, we all can. Yeah, he wasn't really flying. More like avoiding crashing. We'll be blasted out of the sky before we get anywhere. Not if we're in their fighters. No one's gonna be shooting at us. Here comes Dogma. Uh What's going on? Er Nothing. This is about more than just following orders. It is. It is about honor. Where is the honor in marching blindly to our deaths? It is not our call. We are part of something larger. We're not independent of one another. I'm sorry. I cannot just follow orders when I know they're wrong. Especially when lives are at stake. You will if you support the system we fight for. I do support it. I do! But I am not just another number! None of us are! Fives, where are you going? To round up some pilots. All right. Okay, there. Try that out. It should be a little easier. I got it. Whoa! Hardcase, what are you doing? If I knew, I wouldn't be doing it! Look out! Great. This can't get much worse. Sir, there appears to be a disturbance in Hangar 9-4. Trooper, what's going on down there? Hey, hey, I got this. Report, Trooper. Er Yes, sir. Everything's fine in the hangar, sir. Nothing's out of control down here. Then why have the alarms been triggered? It'sjust a drill, a safety drill, sir. Safety check occurs at 0600. Who authorized this drill? Uh We are decrypting the alien hardware, sir. Standard operating procedure. That didn't work. Who is this? What's your CT number? Trooper, identify yourself! Okay. How about this? No, no, no, no, no. That's gonna leave a mark. I'm going down there. Got it. I got it. It's easy. Just level your hands. What, are you crazy? You could've gotten us killed. Not to mention ruining our hopes of flying this mission! It's a malfunction, no harm done. Explain this. Now. Sir, we were decrypting the enemy craft when what appears to be an enemy booby trap went off. A booby trap? Yes, sir. The fighter went haywire and had I not been able to get control of it, and aim the missile at the doors, something worse might've happened. Is this true? Yes, sir. That is what happened, no doubt. Well, Captain Rex, looks like I was correct. The Umbaran fighters are dangerous and not fit for flight. But, sir, we now know how they work. We just need practice! Lock down these fighters. I don't want anything else exploding. Nice work. Now we know how to fly them, and we won't be able to get near them. Oh, come on. That won't stop us. It's just procedure. We can sneak in and be out before Krell knows anything. I thought the plan was to destroy the enemy ship with the fighters, not blow up our own hangar. Look, I agree we should go through with this. So, are you two volunteering to be my pilots or what? I'm in regardless of the consequences. Flying these fighters beats blindly walking into a bunch of missiles, so, I'm in. We just need a plan. Already got one. General Skywalker blew up a droid control ship when he was just a kid. And he told me the trick was hitting the main reactor from the inside. Oh. Well, that won't be so tough. I want a full perimeter sweep. Be on high alert. Fives, what are you doing out here? You should be in the barracks. I found my pilots. We're going after that supply ship. Are you out of your mind? It's a suicide mission, not to mention against orders. It's the right thing to do. We have to try. It sounds like you intend to go through with it. If you're going to try to stop us, we need to know. I can't help you when you get caught. I understand, sir. Hey. Hey, Tup. Wake up! What? I'm trying to sleep. Where are they? - Who? - You know. Don't tell me they're going to disobey orders. Well, I didn't say that. You know we have to tell the General. No. No, no, no, you can't. We have to tell him. If we know what they're up to, and we keep our mouths shut, then we'll be complicit in their insubordination. Do you really want to be court-martialed? Look, sir! These things are trickier than I imagined. I hope this is a good idea. Well, it's better than Krell's plan. I'm only doing this because I don't like him. That's reason enough. I'm just doing it for fun. Whoa! What the Try to fly steady. We're going in! I'm really not liking this. Easy, Hardcase. Don't get an itchy trigger finger. Looks like they think we're Umbaran, all right. There's the supply ship! Follow me! Let's do this. Captain, my flight officer reports the launch of three starfighters. I thought I ordered those ships locked down. Sorry for the confusion, sir. I authorized the recon of the delta in preparation for your attack on the capital. You took it under your own authority to launch such a reconnaissance? Oh, yes, sir. I'm sure the report will make your strategy more effective. I want that report as soon as they are back. Hey, where are you two going? I asked you a question, troopers. We are going to speak with the General, sir. Regarding what? A personal matter. Why don't you tell me, and I'll report it to the General? On second thoughts, sir, it's not important. Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay. Break time is over. Get back to work. Hey! Clones? Intruders! Uh Sir, there are clones in the main hangar. Impossible. The probability of that is 10,003 to 1. Why do they have to go and do that? Uh, sir, we have confirmed that there are three commandeered starfighters heading toward the main reactor. Strengthen our defenses. Reactor core locked, prepare missiles. Fire missiles! Activate ray shields. Roger, roger. Ray shields. Hit the deck! This may have been a bad idea after all. Intruder alert! Our shields are sure taking a beating. We can't turn back now! Cover me! Hardcase! Get back on your ship! Trust me! I've got a plan! This is for the 501 st! Don't wait for me! Hardcase! No! You've disobeyed enough orders today, sir. Follow this one. Get out of here! If I know Hardcase, we'd better leave. Live to fight another day, boys. Live to fight another day. Come on. Come on! They did it. Where's Hardcase? He didn't make it. We couldn't have done it without him. General Krell would like to see them in the tower. You want to see them, sir? Indeed. It seems they have accomplished a very brave act. Unfortunately, they've also committed a serious crime by directly disobeying my order. With all due respect, sir, the order to attack the cargo vessel was mine. If there's a punishment to be given, it should be directed toward me. I'm their commanding officer. General, sir, Captain Rex is attempting to take the blame for actions that were clearly mine. Fives! I request that his admission of guilt be denied and full blame placed upon me. Oh, do you? You willfully countermand my direct order, and now you have the audacity to request who should bear the punishment of your insurrection? Let me be clear about the punishment for the treason committed by ARC trooper and CT-5597. They will be court-martialed, they will be found guilty. And they will be executed! Make no mistake.

I have good news and bad news, Colonel. The bad news is, scans are picking up giant ice formations, commonly called comets, heading straight for us. What? Wha-- What in the world is the good news? At least you have a good excuse if your mission is a failure. Get out of my-- Quick, drop us out of hyperspace. Whoa! Look out! Whoa! The shuttle's power system has been knocked out. I can see that. He says he can fix it. And swinging right. Auxiliary power has been restored, but it is not enough to get us moving. We need the primary motivators reestablished now. Forget that. We need the engines to come on. That's what I'm saying. Uh-oh. They just got bigger. Come on, you lousy mechs. Uh, Colonel, we are headed for that comet. Brace yourself! The engines are back online! Ah! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! We have lost the stabilizers and primary control of the engines. We are going to have to put her down on that planet. What planet is it? Is it Separatist-controlled? Who cares? I care. We can't jeopardize the mission. I think we are past that point, sir. We're going down! Ugh. Oh. I think I ruptured my gizzard. Well, this is a fine mess you mechs got us into. Look at this. All the database says is, \"Abafar: Information on planet void.\" Don't be absurd. We can't just go rushing off like fools into this--this void. We need to stay put, consider all the facts, and then I'll, uh--I'll draw up a reconnaissance plan, and we can-- hey, hey! Where are you going, soldier? He says we have to finish our mission. Hey! Where did you get that? That is classified material. I will not stand for insubordination. Do not worry, Colonel. I can lead the mission from here and return the module. Maybe they'll give me a promotion. Over my dead body. Beezee, pop your top. I will not let you droids commandeer my mission. Ugh, so hot. Ugh, I can't believe I came this close to completing my first mission only to get lost in this detestable desert. Look on the bright side, Colonel. At least it is a sunny day. What sun? I don't see any sun. It's just hot and oppressive. Wait a minute. There's no sun. How do we know which direction we're going? You set your directional guidance to \"straight\"? That's all we're going on, some rudimentary programming directive in a lousy astromech? Yes, I know you're designed for navigation, but that requires map coordinates and environmental input-- something we are sorely lacking here. All right, we can't rely on technology. We have to rely on my training, something you droids don't have. How do you know, Colonel? Because droids don't get training. You get programmed. clang! That's your weakness. So how is your training going to lead us out of this void? Well, uh, my, uh, training as an officer tells me to use all available resources to, uh-- to stay alive until help comes. So your officer training-- how exactly did you learn that? It was drilled into me by my superiors. Then you were programmed. Just like us. What? No, I am not like you droids in any way. I can think outside my program-- I mean, my training. And I can make decisions based on a complex analysis of a situation, which is why I insist we return to the ship. Wait a minute. Why can't I find our tracks? There are not any. What? I noticed it earlier. This surface leaves no trace of us. You noticed it earlier? Why in the world didn't you say anything? I did not think we would want to go backwards when forwards seems to be the only way out of this void. Why are you thinking? I don't want you to think. Thinking is my job. I am the commanding officer. You are just a pilot. Oh, that hurt. Ugh. I have been thinking, Colonel. I told you not to do that. My programming keeps me focused on the task at hand, which means I do not have to worry about my health. I just have to worry about the mission. Don't even go there. So I think-- - Don't do that! When you die, I should lead D-Squad. Stop! You are what's killing me! I can't believe I am forced to justify my existence with a droid! Ugh! I'm at the end! I can feel it! All I ask is that you just let me die with dignity! Is that possible? What? Our ship? You--you stupid lucky droids. You have just taken us in a circle. Wait a minute. Is this really our ship? How long have we been gone? Ugh. No, it is not our ship. No, no, no! No, no, no! Artoo is right. This is what happens when you stay at the ship. Why is this happening to me? Maybe he is going to jump and put himself out of his misery. Well, I vote for myself as the new leader of this mission. You cannot vote for Artoo. He is just a mech. He cannot lead a squadron. Help! There has to be something out there! Show me a sign. A glimmer of hope! I do not know who he is talking to. Maybe whoever programmed him. There! I see something. Ooh, a village! What are you waiting for? We're saved! What exactly do you see, Colonel? I don't know. Hard to say. An outpost. Maybe a cantina. Whatever it is, they can help us. I do not see anything either, Artoo. He should have jumped. No. We're going in circles again. I agree. We cannot trust his training anymore. But I cannot trust your programming either, especially if you will not vote for me to be the new leader. Where are you going now? Hey, that is not true. I am more than just a pilot! We need a new plan, Colonel. I just realized: what if I'm dead? Ooh, what if I died in that shuttle crash and now--now I'm stuck here in limbo? Yes. I should have gone with the mechs. Think about it. Life. Life is a void. We search and search for answers, but there are none. Hope is just an illusion, WAC. Death is the only certainty. Giving up is not in my programming. I am surprised that it is in yours, Colonel. Maybe-- maybe you're right. I was taught to find a rational solution to every problem. But this void-- this proves that that's not always possible. Maybe I need to change how I see things, and that will change my programming, my training. You know what? You are more than just a pilot, WAC. I knew it! I knew it! All right, all right, calm down, soldier. Whoa! Whoa! This is our way out of the void! You have lost your mind, Colonel! No! This is our only hope! We've got to stop following my training or your programming and follow the birds' instincts! Grab hold! Like this? Whoa! Look. I can see a town from here. You can see that, right? I sure can. How did you know, Colonel, that these creatures would get us out of the void? You've got your programming. I've got my training. But these creatures, they have their instinct. They know how to survive out here. If you say so. I don't believe it. Those mechs beat us here. Stupid lucky droids. Just like you said, Colonel. Tell you what, WAC. Why don't you get the squad ready to roll? I've got a second chance to complete this mission, and I intend to take advantage of it. After I rehydrate myself. That'll be all, Corporal. Corporal? Yes, sir. The squad will be ready to roll. Attention! Front and center, soldiers! I want us ready to roll pronto, pronto! That is Corporal WAC to you, soldier. And I will not tolerate insubordination!   \n                "}, "Rookies": {"episode": "s01e05", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe.Clone.Wars. Seasone 1 Eps 5 Clone forces rally. As the war escalates in the Outerrim, the Jedi knights are spread thinly across the galaxy. Many new clones are rushed into service to support their Jedi generals. Unfortunately, because of the relentless demands of battle, many young clones must join the struggle before their intensive training has been completed. These clones, manning of a whole network of tracking stations, are all that stands between the Republic and invasion. This is the deck officer checking in. Nothing going on. As usual. You're listening to the grand army of the Republic broadcast. The voice of the Outerrim. This next one goes out to the med-jumpers of the 224th. \"Smugging it out on Membom.\" Keep your heads down and your seals tight, boys. Yes! Who's next? Fives? Shouldn't you watching your scopes, Hevy? Let's take a look. Well, you know? All clear. Just like the last thousand times I looked at it. Personally, I like that it's so quiet out here. I can catch up on the rig manuals. Echo, what is wrong with you? We should be out on the front lines, blasting droids. Leave him alone. They kept him in his girl's chart too long. Yeah. You may not realize it yet, Fives, but you landed on the most boring post in the Outerrim. And one of the most important. Attention! Sergeant on deck! At ease! Even though you're all new here, I shouldn't have to remind you that this quadrant is key to the Outerrim. If the droids get past this station, they can surprise-attack the facilities where we were born on our home world of Kamino. There are some officers on the way, so I want everything squared away for inspection. - Understood? - Sir, yes, sir! Still here, Anakin. When was the last time you slept? I'll sleep after we find general Grievous. Clone intelligence spotted him in the Balmorra system. That was weeks ago. Since then, he vanished. Well, unlike you, maybe he's getting some much-need rest. Excuse me, general. Incoming transmission from commander Cody. General Kenobi, General Skywalker. Cody. How goes the inspections? The tracking station in Pastil is fully operational. Captain Rex and I are proceeding to the outpost in the Rishi system. Good. Report back once you've arrived. Copy that. Cody out. Good man, that Cody. Don't worry, Anakin. If general Grievous comes anywhere near this quadrant, we'll know about it. - Sir, incoming meteor shower. - Raise the shield. You wanted excitement, Hevy. Right. Meteor shower. What the - Get these doors open. - Roger, roger. CT-327, report in. - Sentry, do you copy? - Interference from the meteors? - I don't see him down there, sarge. - You two, go find him. Droids! Sound the alarm! They've disabled the beacon. Get a message to the fleet! We have to warn Sarge! That should slow those buckets down. - This way. Hurry! - No, we can There's too many. The outpost is secure, general. We shut down the alarm and turned on the all-clear signal. Excellent. Keep that signal alive. I don't want the Republic to find out we're coming. General, our spy on Kamino is making contact. All the preparations for your invasion are in order. Good. Our fleet is approaching the system. We are almost at the rendezvous point. Very good, my Lord. I will await your arrival. The destruction of Kamino will stop their production of clones for good. Rishi outpost, this is commander Cody. Do you copy? Rishi outpost, please respond. Open, open Open comlink channel. Rishi outpost, come in. Rishi outpost, come in. Sorry, commander. We're, experiencing technical difficulties. This is the inspection team. Inspection? Negative, negative. We, do not require an inspection. Everything is fine here. Thank you. We'll be the judge of that. Prepare for our arrival. Roger, roger. Something's not right here. Well, good luck. I'm putting you in charge of this one. What do we do without the sarge? - The reg manual says the next - Wait. Wait. - Did you hear that? - Yeah, what is that? It doesn't sound like droids. Don't forget about those giant eels. I've never seen Cutup! What the hell was that? That was an eel. Now, that's why we have the regulation not to go outside. Let's move before it comes back. Poor Cutup. Look! It's commander Cody. It's the inspection team. This is not good. I don't see the deck officer anywhere. These boys are sloppy. There should always be an officer on duty. We have to warn them. Get on the comlink. I have a bad feeling about this. Welcome to Rishi, Commander. As you can see, the outpost is operating at peak efficiency. Thank you for visiting, and have a safe trip back. We need to inspect the base just the same. There is no need. Everything is fine and fully operational. It's no good. Their comlinks are on a different scramble set. I'll signal them with this flare. Take us to the Sergeant in command. Roger, roger. A droid attack flare? Rex! What the heck are you doing? Relax. Just as I thought. Looks like one of those new commando droids. That flare must have come from the survivors. Ambush! Those clankers have tough armor. We're cut off. Off the platform! Copy that. No sign of them. They must have been pulverized. Resume defensive posts. Well, that sure complicates things, commander. - No worse than that time on Tibrin. - We had Jedi with us on Tibrin. They helped. Hands above your head. Take your sun bonnets off. - Sir? - Take 'em off! Now! Nice shot. The name's Rex. But you'll call me Captain or sir. Sir, yes, sir! I'm Commander Cody, your new boss. My designation is trooper 27-5555, sir. We call him Fives. I'm Hevy. This is Echo. Where's your Sergeant? Dead, sir. We're all that's left. Looks like we got ourselves a batch of shinies, Commander. - Shinies, sir? - That's right. Your armor, it's shiny and new, just like you. Sir, me and my batchers are trained and ready. We'll take back our post, shiny or not. There's hope for you yet, rookie. Commander Cody, do you copy? Captain Rex, please respond. They should have checked in from the Rishi station hours ago. It appears your captain follows orders as well as you do. Perhaps Cody is boring Rex with standard procedures and protocol. we need to work on our own boring procedures and figure out a strategy to find Grievous. Right. Admiral, let me know if you hear from Rex. Look sharp, rookies. As long as those tweezers occupy this post, our home planet of Kamino is at risk. - But there's so many of them. - Doesn't matter, kid. We have to retake this base, so we will retake this base. How do you propose we get through those blast doors, Rex, old boy? I have a few ideas. What is that? Unit 2-6, is that you? Roger, roger. You sound strange. Is something wrong with your vocabulator? - Roger, roger. - Take off your helmet. Let me see your faceplate. Roger, roger. This is never gonna work. - Clones! - Roger, roger. Right. Let's move. - Permission to take point, sir? - I'm always first, kid. - Fives! - He's okay. Focus on the battle. I got one! - Sorry, Echo. I jumped that one. - Like hell you did. Get to the window. It looks like we have more visitors. It looks like a Separatist fleet. That's why they commandeered the outpost. They're mounting a full-scale invasion. We have to warn command. The Republic base is still transmitting the all-clear signal, but for some reason, our commando droids are not responding. That base cannot be allowed to alert the Jedi that we're coming. Send down reinforcements to investigate. Those clankers sabotaged our transmitter, and hard-wired the all-clear signal. It'll take time to repair. - We don't have time. - Look. Well, buddy, you always said you wanted to be on the front lines. We can't protect the outpost long against that army of clankers. Then we'll destroy the outpost instead. But, sir, our mission is to defend this facility at all costs. We have to warn the Republic about the invasion. They'll take notice when the all-clear signal stops. That's right. When they stop receiving our beacon, they'll get the message something's wrong. We'll need every thermal detonator in the inventory. It'll take more than a few detonators to destroy this outpost. We can use the LT. This moon freezes for over half the year. We use Liquid Tibanna as fuel to heat the base. - Liquid Tibanna: highly explosive. - Good. Bring the tanks here and prime the detonators. All right, listen up. There's only one target of interest in this sector: Kamino. It's the closest thing we clones have to a home. Today we fight for more than the Republic. Today we fight for all our brothers back home. - Understood? - Sir, yes, sir! I think we can even the odds a bit, Commander, especially since they don't know we're here. This one here is mine. Big gun doesn't make a big man. Reinforcements reporting. Open up. Didn't say please. Clones! Get 'em! We could use a Jedi about now. Captain Rex, come in. Commander Cody, are you there? General, there's still no response. How about the all-clear signal? Is the base still transmitting? Yes, sir. If something were wrong, Cody would contact us. What is the status of the base? We've run into some difficulties. There seem to be a few clones left, sir. Then wipe them out. We can't let a few puny clones stop us. Fall back to the op center. Move! - Rex, time's wasting. - Almost ready. The handset isn't linked up with the detonator. - Hevy. - Yes, sir. - This detonator isn't working. - I'll take care of it. It'll be fixed in no time. You guys get out of here. Just make it fast. Those droids are getting close. There. That should fix it. This isn't good. There's got to be another way. The base is ours again, sir. - The clones are fleeing. - Cowards. Secure the area. Hevy, hit the - Where's Hevy? - I'm on it, sir. Hevy, get out of there. The remote isn't working. I have to detonate it manually. - Hold on there. - Blast him! We've got to get up there. Back to the maintenance pipe. - Let's move. It's no use. - I know what I have to do. I don't like your tone, rookie. Soldier, come in. Are you there? Soldier, come in! Respond! Hevy, come in. Come in, Hevy! Do we take prisoners? I don't. Hevy always did hate that place. The all-clear signal has been disabled? The Rishi base has stopped transmitting. - Grievous. - Sound the invasion alarm. Let's get the fleet under way. I didn't tell them to blow up the station. But isn't it good that the base is destroyed? Idiot! The Republic fleet. We're outgunned. Get us out of here. We've got those tinnies on the run. Thanks to Hevy. Gunships. On behalf of the Republic, we thank you for your valiant service, and we honor your comrade's sacrifice. Your new unit is lucky to have you. I'd be proud to fight beside you anytime, anywhere. Congratulations. You're not shinies anymore. With all due respect, sir, we failed our mission. We don't deserve this honor. No, if it weren't for you, the Republic wouldn't have learned of the Separatists' invasion until it was too late. You showed me something today. You're exactly the kind of men I need in the 501st. Sir, yes, sir! - You look troubled. - I lost R2 in the field. Well, R2 units are a dime a dozen. - I didn't wipe R2's memory. - What? He's still programmed with our tactics and base locations? Find that droid, Anakin. Our necks might very well depend on it.

Commissioned to protect the strategic world of Bothawui, Anakin Skywalker and his weary battle group are all that stands between the system and domination by the droid army. Among our most recent losses was the battle group at Falleen. The Separatist fleet commanded by General Grievous is headed your way. Seems like that coward always knows where and when to attack us. You're heavily outnumbered, Anakin. I advise retreat. If we run, the Separatists will take control of this sector. I can't let them do that. And that is your problem. Master Kenobi is right. We should regroup. We don't stand a chance against Ahsoka. Suicide is not the Jedi way, Master. You should listen to your Padawan. As you listened to yours, my old Master? No, we are going to stay and fight. And I think I know how to beat Grievous at his own game. Our spies were right, General. The Jedi have positioned a fleet beyond the planetary rings. Move our ships through the asteroid field to engage them. Through the field, sir? If we attack from above, they will have the advantage. So we will go through the rocks. That didn't sound good. All power to the forward shields. What if they attack us from behind? They can't. The asteroids will protect us. Gold Squadron, tighten formation. Slow approach. Let's draw them in. Yes, sir. Don't worry, R2. Grievous is falling right into our trap. Resolute command to Gold Leader. We are standing by. Enemy closing to zone six. Patience, Ahsoka. Zone four. Zone three. General, we have a clear shot at their cruisers. Good. Good! They're right on top of us. Should we commence firing? Wait. Wait. Concentrate fire on the closest Republic cruiser. Roger, roger. We're outgunned. We're not gonna last a mynock minute out here. Hang on, Ahsoka. We've got em' right where we want em'. Watch your stabilizer, Gold Six! It's no good. Incoming's too heavy. Gold Squadron, take evasive action. Sir, yes, sir. Breaking off. No, R2, we're not retreating. Good thing you gave us that extra power. Let's finish them off! Ahsoka, they're in position. Unveil our little surprise. Right away, Master. Rex, old boy, it's time you joined the party. With pleasure, sir. General, we've been outflanked. All units, fire at will. Impossible! Forward cannon, let em' have it. This is too easy. Get us out of here! Uh, where are we supposed to go? Uh, General? Well, I guess I'm in charge now. Grievous! Let's finish this. All batteries, target that command bucket. He's powering up his hyperdrive, R2. Hang on. More speed, R2. See what you can do about that, buddy. I got a bad feeling about this. What happened? You owe Rexster your skin, Skyguy. Just doing my job, sir. It was your plan that won the day. Grievous is awol, but his fleet of tinnies is nothing but spare parts. Good work, both of you. Where is R2? I'm sorry, Master. He is gone. Congratulations, Anakin. Your resourcefulness always amazes me. Thank you, Master. You look troubled. I lost R2 in the field. Well, R2 units are a dime a dozen. I'm sure you'll find a suitable replacement. I could take a squad out there, track him down. Anakin. It's only a droid. You know attachment is not acceptable for a Jedi. It's not just that, Master. Uh, how do I put this? I didn't wipe R2's memory. What? He's still programmed with our tactics and base locations? If the Separatists get a hold of him What possessed you not to erase that droid's memory? Master Obi-Wan, sometimes R2 having that extra information has come in handy. Well, then find that droid, Anakin. Our necks might very well depend on it. Right away, Master. You ready to go, Snips? Master, they just delivered your replacement astromech droid. This is R3-S6. I've heard that the new R3s are far faster in thinking skills and more powerful than the old R2 units. And best of all, Master, he is gold. A gold droid for Gold Leader of Gold Squadron. You can't replace R2. Don't worry, Goldie. You'll get to know him later. Come on. There's my ship. R2 is gone. He must have escaped. He's got to be around here somewhere. R2 isn't on the scanners. But there is a ship out there. [ Vulture's Claw ] Looks like a Trandoshan scavenger, probably combing the battlefield for salvage. The historical texts say Archive texts can only teach you a part of the picture, my young Padawan. You'll learn a lot more through some hands-on experience. Ugh! What's that smell? You'll get used to it. Hey, we'd like to buy a droid. You sellin'? We're looking for an R2 unit. You happen to pick up any recently? An \"R\" series? No, no, not for a long time. \"Pookums\" here really has her heart set on another R2. She lost the last one. Pookums? Oh, brother. Nice R3 unit. Trade for a C-14? Not on your life, lizardo. Now let's see how much I have here. I tell you what. I may have an R2 unit buried somewhere in the hold. Help yourself. But be careful. There are many, um, unique items down here. Master? These must be the unique items we were warned about. These assassin droids can be very unpredictable. They're switched off. They don't look so tough to me. Nothing looks tough to you. Take my word for it: they're deadly. R3, access the computer and find the inventory manifest. R2's gotta be around here somewhere. Did you hear that? Hear what? That sounded like R2. How can you tell the difference? It came from down here. R3, get this open. We don't need the lights on! No, Goldie. The hatch. Never mind. I'll do it myself. Master! Goldie, shut these droids down! I'm afraid R3 is a little slow on the uptake. Back at you, piston head. You were right about the hands-on experience, gramps. Much better than the archives. Good job, but you missed one. As for you, Stubby, you'd make a poor excuse for a light switch. I'm sure he did his best. His best to get us killed? R2 would have never made that mistake. R3 can't even get the door open. A little late, Stubby. If you didn't have a lightsaber, you'd be a dead man. Where's my droid? Master, what are you doing? R2's not here. Let's get out of here. I told you there were no R2 droids down here. Look at this mess you made! You owe me, Jedi. You'll be sorry you ever came aboard my ship, Jedi. I'm about to make your life miserable. What is it? I'm en route to the rendezvous point, General. I've got the merchandise you were looking for. It must be valuable. A Jedi came looking for it. Maybe it is worth more than we negotiated. Don't push me, slime. You bring that R2 unit to me as fast as you can get here Or else Ah, yes, of course, General. Just kidding. We have to assume that R2 was destroyed in the explosion that claimed your ship. Yes, Master. Our intelligence has confirmed that Grievous' spies have been intercepting our transmissions. He must have some sort of secret listening post out there somewhere. That would explain how he's been able to ambush our fleets. Split up your squadrons, Anakin. Find that base and destroy it. It's as good as done, Master Kenobi. May the Force be with you both. I'll sweep the outer corridor while the rest of your ships focus on the center. Are you sure you want to go it alone? I'm sure. More than one fighter will just draw too much attention. Yes, sir. Master, you'll need a droid to help you navigate. I think Stubby is defective. Give him another chance, Master. This is the perfect time for you and him to, you know, bond. All right. Come on, Stubby. May the Force be with you, Master. Removed your restraing bolt, have you? What were you up to? R3, have you verified those coordinates on the search grid? Okay, let's see what we can find. Activate long-range scanners. No, not the tracking beacon! Shut it down, R3. Shut it down. That's Master Skywalker's tracking beacon. What's he doing? Rex, get a hold of as many men as you can. Right away, sir! There's our Jedi tracking beacon. Skywalker, now you have fallen into my trap. Why do I have to do everything? Let's hope Grievous didn't hear that. Yeah, he heard it. Time to leave. Plot a course out of here and prep the hyperdrive engines. What are you doing? I said \"prep them\" not \"drop them\". Where's R2 when I need him? Launch everything we have. Sir, it's only one fighter. He can't escape. Everything! I know, I know! Missiles. I hate missiles. We're going on the offensive, R3. Get ready to cut the engines. Will you just do what I tell you? Hit the stabilizers, R3. Hey, that was clever. Silence! Move the cruisers into attack position! All right, R3. Let's get turned around before those fighters catch up to us. You know, if this ship blows up, you go with it. What do you mean the laser guns won't fire? Cargo bay doors open. You better get inside. I'd love to, but R3's having a problem with the engines. Destroy those ships! Don't let them get away! Let's give him some cover, boys. Yes, sir! Steady. Almost there. I'm inside. Now let's get out of here, Ahsoka. Power it up, Rex. We're going right between those tin cans. Hit it, Rex. Uh They got away, Sir. Hey, Goldie! What did you think of your first adventure? I'll tell you what I think. I think I'm lucky to be alive. Great, now you hurt his feelings. His feelings? What about R2? He's still out there.

Just the good ones. The hyperdrive's been activated. - Shut it down. - I can't. - General Secura, what's going on? - We're going into hyperspace. - Detach! Detach! - They'll take us with them. Evasive maneuvers. Plot every course along their last known trajectory. We need to finish this battle and find them. I need you with commander Bly up on the bridge right now. I should stay. Commander Bly doesn't need my help. Anakin does. You can help Anakin by getting this ship to safety. - General Secura, we have a problem. - What is it, commander? In our haste to escape, the navicomputer's coordinates were inputted incorrectly. And, we're headed right for a star. It's no use. The navigation computer is completely fried. Shut down all power circuits to reset the coordinates. That will cut off Anakin's life support. I don't like it either, but it's a risk we're going to have to take. We're switching off primary power units. Cutting it awfully close. Ready to shut off auxiliary power. On three. One, two, three. We're out of hyperspace. Resume all power. Switch the power back on. What are you waiting for? Hurry. Hurry. We're not going to crash into the star, but we're going to hit that planet. Everyone out! Well, we made it. And master Skywalker is still alive. I'm just glad he wasn't awake to see that landing. He would have been proud. I've certainly perfected the art of demolishing ships and almost getting my master killed. Anakin doesn't have much time. We have to find help tonight. You and Bly go south. Rex and I will stay here with Anakin. No, Ahsoka. In order to get help quickly, we must work together. I can't leave him. Master, I know if I was hurt, he'd never leave me behind. I know this is hard, Ahsoka, but Anakin has to stay behind, and we have to go now. There is nothing more we can do for him. We must do all we can to get off this planet. As a Jedi, it is your duty to do what is best for the group. General Secura, look. We're not the only ones here on this planet. There has to be some kind of something here. If you don't mind me asking, general, where exactly are we going? To go find the people who live on this planet. Where are we going to find them? We have no idea where they are. It seems to me that the people we're looking for live near giant trees. Very perceptive, padawan. Be strong, master, just a little bit longer. Rex will watch over you. - It is time to go. - Don't worry, kid. I'll take good care of him. Captain Rex, keep your locator on. We should be back by daybreak with whoever or whatever lives on this planet. Got it, general Secura. Hey, kid, good luck. Come on, guys. Let's move out. I can still sense your worry for Anakin, your attachment to him. It's just I get so confused sometimes. It's forbidden for Jedi to form attachments, yet we are supposed to be compassionate. It is nothing to be ashamed of, Ahsoka. I went through the same process when I was your age with my own master. Really? You? He was like a father to me. I realized that for the greater good, I had to let him go. Don't lose a thousand lives just to save one. Maybe. But that doesn't mean that I can't try to save his life. I don't see any signs of life. Watch out! No wonder it's deserted. It's a death trap. You'd have to be crazy to want to dodge those on a daily basis. It looks like someone or something intelligent enough to figure out a use for the pods has dragged them away. All we have to do is follow the trail. Let's go. General? Are you all right? Be Behind you. What the Watch your left! Cameron's dead. So are Lucky and Flesh. We have to keep moving. Pod central. We made it. Hello? What have you come here for? We are peacekeepers. We are Jedi from the galactic Republic. Our ship crashed a few miles away, and one of us is very badly injured. We need your help. Violence breeds violence. Jedi are no peacekeepers. We're fighting for freedom. And freedom and peace require fear and death? We colonized this system to find solace from your wretched war. We came here to find peace. You must leave. You will only destroy what small amount of peace is left in the galaxy. You will only bring the destruction of us. Regardless of the clone wars and our part in them, we still need your help. I'm afraid I must do what's best for my people. We cannot help you. Please. Can you at least give us some medical supplies? My friend is dying. I cannot ignore a plea for help. I will send my son Wag Too to help your friend. He is a healer. But only one Jedi may go with him. The other must stay as insurance. We wouldn't want a surprise attack on our village or the kidnapping of our only healer. Bly and I will stay. Padawan, go and help your master. The clone and his blaster cannot stay. - He will go with the young one. - I can handle it. I don't need help. Don't worry. Be mindful of your surroundings, padawan. Those creatures are still out there. Got it. We won't be long. Here. It will restore your energy. Thank you. I am sure you are aware that the Jedi did not initiate the clone wars. Our only intention was to end it and restore peace to our galaxy. What difference does it make who started the war and who only wants to end it? No side is free of fault. It takes two to fight. But isn't liberty worth fighting for? But is it worth killing for? Fighting for something doesn't necessarily mean you have to destroy everything in your path. Only when you lay your arms down and pursue a course of nonviolence can you make this claim to me that the Jedi are peacekeepers. General, you need to maintain your rest. I can't rest. Rex, they're coming. I can hear them. We must fight. No, don't. Fine. Good work, little guy. Master! Good to see you, snips. This is Wag Too. He's a healer. - He can make you well again. - Don't you worry. I can fix you right up. Snips? The oil from the pods will aid in the healing process. Don't worry. You'll be well in no-time. You were right all along, master Secura. About what? If I had stayed with Anakin, we probably wouldn't have found this village in time to save him. At least this whole ordeal is over now. We still have to find a way off this planet. Well, I'm sure admiral Yularen and the Republic fleet are looking for us. It shouldn't take them too long to get here. Every Jedi knows you cannot save someone who doesn't want to be saved. Droids inbound! We're stranded on an uncharted world, and the locals refuse to fight. Your presence here endangers us. But young Skywalker will not give up on them. He just might be good enough to save them anyway. We are about to find out.   \n                "}, "Liberty of Ryloth": {"episode": "s01e21", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tStar.Wars.The.Clone.Wars.S01E21.HDTV.XviD-SC-SDH Republic victory is at hand. Clone troopers, under the command of the Jedi, have successfully invaded the Separatist-occupied world of Ryloth. Anakin Skywalker battles the enemies in the skies, while Obi-Wan Kenobi frees villages from the grip of vile Separatist leader Wat Tambor. Now Jedi General Mace Windu leads the attack on enemy lines in the final offensive to liberate the capital city of Lessu. Take cover. - We have stopped the enemy advance. - Give me those. Good. Now order our cannon to target their rear units. We'll box them in and blast them to pieces. We're pinned down! Commander, bring out the lightning squad. I want lightning up here now! Get the injured back. I'm gonna clear the road. - Sir, the enemy is advancing again. - Let me see. Find some cover. Move it! Let's go! He's all yours, General. We'll lead the way, Commander. Forward! Now that Jedi is leading the attack. Concentrate all your fire on those walkers! Should we run? It would be better if we just surrendered. How many men did we lose? of 3 walkers. The good news is General Kenobi's broken their lines. We have a clear path straight to the capital now. This battle was costly. We're gonna need help to take the city. The Republic is advancing faster than I expected. I calculate they will reach the main gates by morning. - I recommend we prepare our retreat. - I will not retreat. That Jedi does not have the troops to take this city. Bring our units inside the walls and secure the bridge. What's your progress, Skywalker? My fighters have secured control of the space around Ryloth. We have the Separatist cruisers on the run. Very good, General Skywalker. Master Kenobi has taken the Jixuan desert, so the southern hemisphere is ours. Then it's almost over. Not yet. The key position is the capital of Lessu. Our spies are certain the Separatist leader Wat Tambor - has his command center there. - When taken the city we have, - capture Tambor we must. - It's not going to be easy, Master. Tambor has chosen his stronghold well. This plasma bridge is the only way in or out. I'm afraid a siege could drag on indefinitely. My people have suffered so much already. A plan you have to take the bridge, Master Windu? With our forces stretched so thinly, I'm gonna enlist the help of the freedom fighters led by Cham Syndulla. His fight against the droids made him a symbol of freedom for the people. Cham Syndulla was a radical before the war. He is very unpredictable. He can't be trusted. I know Syndulla seeks to gain power. We were political rivals. I'll leave the politics to you, Senator. I'm gonna do whatever I can to help these people. Perhaps we could send you Republic reinforcements instead. There are no reinforcements available, Chancellor. We can't win without Syndulla's help. What makes you think the rebels are this way, General? What is it, sir? The resistance fighters ride creatures native to this region. And these tracks are fresh. Which means they can't be that far. Isn't this the spot where they were massacred? Looks like it was a quite of a fight. Wonder who put up these gravestones. Is that them? Your tactical droid has informed me of the pitiful job you have done protecting our investment on Ryloth. That droid exaggerates. I have not lost yet. You're no match for Master Windu. Do not become greedy, Emir Tambor. Take what valuables you can and destroy everything else. Everything? We can put this defeat to political use. The charred ruins of Ryloth will demonstrate to the galaxy the cost of a Republic victory. As you wish. Keep on the lookout for that lost patrol. Did you hear that? I don't see anything. - Why didn't we take them out, sir? - I have a feeling the rebels will do it for us. - Look out! It's an ambush! - Help! It's the resistance! I was wondering when you'd find me, Master Jedi. General Syndulla, - I've come for your help. - What makes you think you'll get it? Emir Tambor, our bombers are nearly ready for launch. And now I will ready your ship for evacuation. I am not yet ready to leave. In any case, we have a schedule to keep. The ship will be ready. - Some hideout you have here. - It has advantages. We saw the graves of many of your people in that battlefield as well. Together, we can prevent that from happening again. Do you know why we were massacred, Master Jedi? When the droids swept over Ryloth, the Republic was unable to help us. We were forced to surrender, and we came here unarmed. The Separatists brought tanks to exterminate us. Come here, boy. Come on. Don't be afraid. See, there's nothing to be afraid of here. He says his blurrg may be ill-tempered, but she's much faster than your riding machines. I don't know about that. What is this, a scratch? Gobi, get better. I need you. We have little food or drink, but it is our tradition to share what we do have with our guests. Target every Twi'lek village in range, - the inhabited ones first. - Of course. Our scouts reported in from the village up ahead. The enemy's already pulled out. Women and children are all that's left. See if we can spare some rations. They'll be hungry. Sir, enemy ships are entering our sector. - Damage report! - There's no tactical damage, sir. It didn't hit us. They bombed the village. Make contact with General Windu. I hope you don't mind this. A little distraction goes far to ease the burden of the war on my men. You have provided well for your men, all your people. So why won't you help me free them from this occupation? I don't trust senator Ta, his plans for our world after the war. The Republic will help you rebuild. - We won't abandon you. - Your troops will stay for security? For a while, to keep the peace. Another armed occupation is not a free Ryloth. How long before I am fighting you, Master Jedi? What is it? The droids have begun a firebombing campaign. Several villages in our sector have been destroyed, sir. Make the arrangements. I will speak to senator Ta. Is this all of it? We are still awaiting two transports from our southern base. - Should we depart without them? - No. I will have every valuable on this rock before I leave. Emir Tambor, why haven't you evacuated? Our exit strategy is taking more time to implement. I want you out of the city before the Republic arrives. Once Master Windu has invaded the capital, you will bomb it from afar. - Am I understood? - Yes, count Dooku. You will not do anything until I give the order. We have our orders, Emir. Senator Ta, so glad you could join us from comfortable Coruscant. Our people have survived with only me. I knew you would try to turn this into a campaign to take power. Need I remind you that it is I who leads our people in the senate? And it is I who leads our people here and now. There will be nothing left to lead if you two refuse to work together. - General Windu, do you copy? - I hear you, Skywalker. My fighters are taking out the bombers as fast as they can, but there are just too many. I doubt we can stop them all. I suggest you get the people away from the cities. You must destroy those bombers, Skywalker. - Then meet me at the capitol. - I'll do what I can. What can the Separatists hope to gain from burning our homes? Nothing. Wat Tambor spoils for others what he cannot possess. Then we must act quickly. Senator, your people are hesitant to join us because they're worried there'll be another military occupation. The people have my promise that the clone army will leave once Ryloth is free of those droids. What assurance can you give Senator Ta you will not try to assume power? I only want to see my people free, Master Jedi. I give my word. I believe in democracy. Then we are together in this. Men of Ryloth, the time has come to free ourselves! Keep moving. Try and keep up, clone. Tambor is still there. How are we going to attack with my people so close? Your people will never be in danger if our walkers can cross the bridge into the city. The key is getting control of that bridge. Perhaps there is your way. My spies tell me those transports carry treasure. You think we can use them to get across the bridge? It is risky. They are usually scanned while crossing. When I get control of the bridge, you must start the attack. They're in. Let's go. Commander, I'll need you to create a diversion. Get the rest of Lightning squadron ready. Yes, sir. My men are ready. It is time to leave. The Republic walkers are holding at 1,200 meters. Sir, the last shipments of treasure are approaching. Just in time. Activate the bridge and get them across immediately. Initiating plasma projectors. All right, hold it there. Let's go. The boss wants this done. This one's all clear. Here they come. Wait! I'm picking up an anomaly in there. Stay alert. Trooper, prepare to fire. Open the cargo hatch. - Oh, no! - You're under arrest. You have the r We're under attack! Deactivate the bridge! Well. Too bad for them. Run for it! They're turning the bridge off! I'll hold them off. Get that bridge back up. Sir, yes, sir! Charge! Save it. Bridge is up, sir. You take these droids. I'll go find Wat Tambor. My ship! I'm afraid Emir Tambor refused to retreat in time. That is Unfortunate. Order our bombers to destroy the capitol immediately. Surrender. General Windu, perhaps we can come to a compromise. Not when I hold all the cards. It appears a surrender is unnecessary. We will all perish for the glory of the Separatist alliance. - That was close, Master. - Isn't it always, snips? What are your terms for surrender? They're unconditional. Agreed. I thank you, Master Jedi. Today, all of Ryloth thanks you. You're earned your freedom, General, all of you.   \n                "}, "Overlords": {"episode": "s03e15", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t  Mysterious message! A transmission has been intercepted far beyond the outer rim, deep in the crelythiumn system. Why the call has been made and from where cannot be established. But buried in the message is a jedi distress code that has not been used in over 2,000 years. Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and his padawan ahsoka are sent to investigate. Fearing a separatist trap, they are to meet with a heavily armed jedi cruiser. Rex Rex, do you read me? We're at the rendezvous point awaiting your arrival. Where are you? Sir, we are at the rendezvous point and there's no sign of you on our scanners. Oh, come on. That's impossible. Something's wrong. We're at the exact coordinates where the distress signal originated, but there's nothing here. Rex is at the exact same coordinates and he's not here. This is getting interesting. Unable to find you. Where are you, sir? Something's blocking the signal. ] Not good. Everything's dead, even the life support. Hmm, this is really strange. There. See? Nothing to be concerned about after all. Then what's that? It's pulling us towards it. Everyone, strap yourselves in. Looks as though we're going for a ride. I must have blacked out. Then who landed the shuttle? Not me. Mm Where are we? Some kind of organic mass. All of our readings indicate that it's bigger than an asteroid. But at least the atmosphere is breathable. Well, this is getting more unusual by the minute. I can't even lock down where in the galaxy we are Or if we are even in our own galaxy. Well, the ship's systems seem ne but for whatever reason, nothing's working. Hey! I saw something. A reflection, up on the hill. I don't see anything. Are you the one? What the What? Did you hear that? I didn't hear anything. Are you the one? Hello. Who are you? I am daughter. Are you the one? Uh The one what? I will take you to him. Him, who? Did you bring us here? Only he can help you. There is little time. Follow me. We must have shelter by nightfall. And we thought the planet was strange. How about this one? We'll be fine as long as we stay together. Have you noticed the seasons seem to change with the time of day? Yeah. And there are no animals. And you sense it? Mm-hmm, since we arrived. The force is very strong. An intersection unlike anything I've ever felt before. Be wary. Excuse me. Who are you taking us to? The father, of course. Of course. And what exactly are you? We are the ones who guard the power. We are the middle, the beginning, and the end. Glad she cleared that up for us. Hey! Look out! Thank you. You're welcome. It is forbidden for you to touch me. Sorry. I was just saving your life. That was my brother's work. You are in great danger. Wait for me. Do not leave this place. Hey! Wait. Anakin, are you there? Are you all right? But our friend here has run off! Go back to the ship and try sending another distress call. I'll follow her and find out how to get off this rock. And if this is a trap? Then I'm not gonna wait around to find out. Anakin, stop! Wait for us to find another way around and meet you. Anakin? So reckless and impatient. He'll find her. Yes, and what else? Storm's coming. The ship's gone. Yes, I see that. It was here, no question. And look. Everything's dying. Did you lose something? You didn't do as you were asked. And what was that? My sister said to wait! Did she now? Well, we were unfortunately separated. We'd like our ship back if you don't mind. Not Yet. Is it true that he is the chosen one? What do you know of such things? What is about to happen shall occur whether you like it or not. You are sith. Sith? Yes And no. The storms here are quite lethal. If you want to live, I suggest you find shelter. What in the universe was that? I'm not quite sure. Quick. There's a cave over there. Whoever I'm looking for is in that monastery. Welcome, my friend. What is it that you want from me? To learn the truth about who you really are, one that maybe you have known all along, one you must believe in order to fulfill your destiny. Enough with the riddles, old man. Tell me what's going on here. As you can see, there is nowhere else to go. It is late. You will be my guest tonight. Obi-Wan, have you done as I asked? Have you trained the boy? Master qui-gon. How are you here? I am here because you are here. No, I don't understand. What is this place? Unlike any other, a conduit through which the entire force of the universe flows. Are we in danger? This planet is both an amplifier and a magnet. Three are here who seek Skywalker. They, like me, believe him to be the chosen one. You were right. The force within him is stronger than any known jedi. I have trained him as well as I could, but he is still willful and balance eludes him. If he is the chosen one, he will discover it here. And if not? Then you must realize with his power, this is a very dangerous place for him to be. Wake up, my son. I must tell you a secret. Who's there? Who's there, I said. It is me, ani, your mother. What kind of black arts is this? You're dead. Nothing ever really dies, my son. I have a secret to tell you. Then tell me. Everything you have done, everything you have learned has led you here. Whatever you are, my mother is Is dead. And you blame yourself. Your jedi training has served you well, ani, but you are more than a jedi. Tell me, where is your pain, so I might take it away. I was too late to save you. I failed as a jedi and I failed you. How so? I tasted only vengeance when I slaughtered so many to avenge your death. It is time you realized that your guilt does not define you, my son. You define your guilt. The only love I feel in my heart is haunted by what would happen should I let go. Then it is not love. It is a prison. But I I have a wife. You've met her. She's everything to me. She is not your destiny. But I love her. No! She is a poisoner! What are you? Your fate! Are you happy, child? Your master, does he treat you well? What concern of it is yours? I am your future, your potential. This is a trick. There is a wildness to you, young one. Seeds of the dark side planted by your master. Do you feel it? No. He is like no other jedi. Passionate, impulsive, but I trust him with my life. There are many contradictions in you And in him. Be warned, you may never see your future if you remain his student. Leave this planet! Ahsoka. I had a vision. I think Anakin may be in trouble. Cannot sleep? To strike an unarmed man is hardly the jedi way. You're a sith lord! You have a very simple view of the universe. I am neither sith nor jedi. I am much more And so are you. I see through your spells and visions, old man. Tell me what is going on here. Some call us force-wielders. The jedi have never spoken of this. Mm. Few still know of our existence. In that room, my mother came to me, but it was not her. It was something else. Ah. My son, I suspect. We can take many forms. The shapes we embody are merely a reflection of the life force around us. You carry a great sadness in your heart. My children and I can manipulate the force like no other, therefore, it was necessary to withdraw from the temporal world and live here as anchorites. As a sanctuary? And a prison. You cannot imagine what pain it is to have such love for your children and realize that they could tear the very fabric of our universe. I don't understand. It is only here that I can control them A family in balance. The light and the dark. Day with night. Destruction replaced by creation. Then why reveal yourselves to us? There are some who would like to exploit our power. The sith are but one. Too much dark or light would be the undoing of life as you understand it. When news reached me that the chosen one had been found, I needed to see for myself. The chosen one is a myth. Is it? I should very much like to know. Why don't we find out together? Pass one test, and I shall know the truth. Then you and your friends may leave. The longer we stay here, the stranger this place gets. It appears the planet is renewing herself. What about master Skywalker? Anakin will not be easy to deceive. It is time to face your guilt and know the truth. Roar! Whatever he wants, don't do it, master! Let them go. I will not play your games. Oh, but I think you will. I have ordered my children to kill your friends. The question is, which one will you choose to save: Your masr or your apprentice? You must now release the guilt and free yourself by choosing. No! Their powers are too strong for us, Anakin. Save ahsoka. Let them go. Only you can make my children release them. Anakin, the planet is the force. Use it. You will let them go!   Down! On your knees! And now you see who you truly are. Only the chosen one could tame both my children. I have taken your test. Now fulfill your promise and let us go. Ah, but first you must understand the truth. Now all of you, leave us. Do not trust him. You think? I said leave us. Do you feel your destiny? You must see it now. I am dying, and you must replace me. Replace you? I can't stay here. But this is yours. It has been foretold. The chosen one will remain to keep my children in balance. No. I cannot force you to do this. The choice must be yours. But leave and your selfishness shall haunt you and the galaxy.

On a secret mission for the Republic, Colonel Gascon and his intrepid droid squad successfully steal an encryption module from a Separatist ship. During their escape, our heroes crash on the Outer Rim planet of Abafar and find themselves stranded in the strange wasteland called The Void. Now, after surviving against all odds, our heroes must find a way home and deliver the encryption module to crack the Separatist code and stop an enemy attack. I have never been to Tatooine, but if this place reminds you of it, Artoo, remind me never to go there. Don't be absurd, Qutee. These people aren't dangerous. Most of these people are probably hiding from someone or something. That's the way it is on these Outer Rim armpits. Nobody's here by choice, which goes double for me. I hope you have a plan to get us off this armpit, Colonel. Of course I do, Corporal. All we need is a communications uplink and some fuel. Thank you for the reminder, Ceefor, but I'm well aware our shuttle's lost in The Void. I'm talking about fuel for me. You droids can putter along on battery power but I need food to survive. My power cells are running low too, and an oil bath would be nice. All this dust is wreaking havoc on my joints. Forget it, Beezee. We're not on vacation here. Artoo, is the encryption module safe? Nothing short of death or dismemberment will stop Colonel Meebur Gascon from delivering that module to Coruscant. Well, I'll be. A diner. A place of eating. I'm saved. Artoo, you and the other 'mechs scout the perimeter. Find out if there are any unfriendlies around. Corporal, you and I will refuel in this fine establishment. Good day. I am Colonel Gascon of the Grand Army of the Republic. And I am here on very important business. I don't have much time, so if you'll be so kind as to fix me your daily special and let my droid recharge. No droids. Fine. Wait for me outside, Corporal. We don't serve your type either. What type are you referring to? Conduit worms. I beg your pardon. I am a Zilkan. You'll be begging for your life if you don't beat it. Beat it. Uh-oh. Ah! Oh, ah! This is an outrage. That monstrosity will rue the day he denied me a meal. I would not push it, Colonel. That monstrosity might make a meal out of you. I don't care. I'm famished. I think I can help. Your meal awaits you, sir. You short-circuiting hydrospanner, that's no meal. That is garbage. What is the difference? It is edible, is it not? Agh! Oh, uh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. Look, I could get you some food, but normally people come in the front door. But there's no problem. You do know that you're eating garbage, right? You're a clone. Excuse me? Uh, I-- I wouldn't know about that. My--my name's Gregor. Uh, wait, what's a clone? You are a clone. Are you working undercover? I don't know what you're talking about. Listen to me, soldier, whatever your assignment is, it can't be more important than mine. It is his first real mission. He is just a map reader. Don't listen to that ignoramus. You are a clone and a soldier in the Republic Army, and I order you to take me to your ship. We need to get back to Coruscant immediately. Uh, look, friend, I was just trying to help. I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way. I do not think that soldier believes you are a colonel, uh, Colonel. Gregor! Get back to work. Uh, excuse me. I got to go. I don't want to lose my job. But I'm still hungry. Well, what's the scouting report? Separatist droids? Hmm, well, that complicates matters. So, uh, boss, you know, I was just wondering No, you can't have a raise, Gregor. Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't want a raise, sir. I-I just wanted to know, what's a clone? Someone told me I was a clone today. They insisted. Heh. A clone? Clones fight battles across the galaxy. They are brave soldiers. Does that sound like you? You're a dishwasher, Gregor. Forget about clones or anything like that. You have good life here, a simple life. More than you had when Borkus found you. I know, sir. And I appreciate everything that you've done. Believe me. But I thought maybe you could-- could you tell me, how did I get here? Where did you find me? Enough questions. Go home. Sleep. Come back tomorrow. Do your job. And I don't ever want to hear that word \"clone\" again, understand? I cannot help noticing that we are already on our third plan. Smart battle strategy requires flexibility and improvisation, something droids are not known for. Artoo is right. Droids are not known for being flexible, because we are programmed to be right the first time. Well, answer me this, Corporal, if the Jedi Council thought one of you droids were better prepared to lead this mission, then why did they put me in charge? 'Cause you were the only one who could fit inside Beezee. No, it is because my power of deduction told me that if there are Separatist droids on Abafar, then there must be a landing zone nearby where there will be no doubt a shuttle to take us home. That, Corporal, is why I am in charge. Now, we are going to waltz down there, undetected, just like we did on the dreadnought, and commandeer that shuttle without incident. The 'mechs have a point, Colonel. After what we did on the dreadnought, those battle droids probably have our identities scanned. We will have to fight our way onto the shuttle this time. Hmm, you droids may have a point. But there's no way in Malachor that I'm going to lead this pitiful squad on an assault of that landing zone. What is the plan now, Colonel? We're going to wait until our clone gets off work, then enlist his help, whether he wants to or not. Captain Rex reporting for duty. Agh! What? I I don't understand. That's me? No, that's Captain Rex. He's a clone in the Republic Army, just like you, Gregor. I can't believe it. Okay, slow down. Slow down. So you're telling me that there are more of these clones? Millions. A whole army's worth. Uh-huh. And they all look exactly like me? No, those clones are warriors, professional soldiers created by the Republic, trained to fight, and die if necessary, in our war against the Separatists. They're not dishwashers living in some vermin-infested hovel. Look, I'm lucky to live in this place. Mr. Borkus says my salary doesn't even cover the rent, so he pays the difference for me. Don't you get it, Gregor? You're his slave. We need to figure out who you really are, how you got here. Are you sure you don't remember anything? Well, all I remember is waking up on a transport. Somehow we crashed on Abafar. And, well, Mr. Borkus says I have amnesia. Hmm. Every clone has an identifying code on their wrist. Your military records will be in the database. Scan him, Artoo. Impressive. Gregor, your designation is CC-5576-39. You were a captain and part of an elite squad. A clone commando. Your file says you were reported missing in action during the Battle of Sarrish. Sarrish? Sarrish. Wait. What was the Battle of Sarrish? It was one of the Republic's most devastating losses. Sarrish. Yes. Yes, I remember now. So many soldiers were dying. Dodo you remember how you escaped Sarrish? No. I just remember seeing all those bodies. Bodies everywhere. I knew I had to get help. But that's where the memory stops. Well, soldier, there's nothing you can do about that battle now, but you can help us. Our mission depends on it. Uh, Colonel, Gregor said to give him five minutes, but it has been six. What if he does not accept your offer to join us? Then I'll go back in there and personally knock some sense into him. That won't be necessary. Whoa! I figured at least looking like a soldier might bring back some more memories, until we recover my equipment anyway. I overheard you guys talking. I think I know where my armor is. Let's go check out the diner. Step it up, soldiers. This isn't a party. We do not have all night. Looking for this? My uniform. My equipment. All this time you knew who I was and didn't tell me. Why? I don't care who you were. You are dishwasher now. And you owe me for saving you from your crash. Your life is mine, Gregor. You didn't save me. You turned me into a slave. I've worked in this dump taking orders from you when I could have been fighting for the Republic. I want my life back. You want your freedom, Gregor? Take your gun from me. Show me you are a soldier. You see? You are no soldier. You are a dishwasher. Why, you no-good droids. Let go of me. Agh! Oh. Agh! Take your things, Gregor. We're getting out of here. Don't leave, Gregor. It's a big galaxy out there, bigger than you know. Stay here, where your life is simple. Simple isn't good enough anymore. Not for this clone. Ha! You will never get off Abafar, you and your little Republic friends, not after your Jedi cruiser blows up. What are you talking about? Why do you think the Separatists bother coming here? They are mining our Rhydonium to load on the shuttle and destroy your ride home. You will see. You will all be stuck here begging Borkus for a job in his diner. Okay, let's see what we're up against. Gregor. Wait. There. There's a cruiser up there. And that shuttle, I think-- Yes, it's being loaded up with Rhydonium canisters. Huh. I guess Mr. Borkus was actually telling the truthfor once. What exactly is Rhydonium? It's a fuel. Mostly been mined out on Abafar. It's volatile and dangerous. Yes, we do have a new mission: Stop the Separatists from blowing up that cruiser. I'll cover you and clear the way, Colonel. You all head straight to the shuttle. I'll take care of those clankers. Hmm, sounds like a good plan. You soldiers ready to get dangerous? I'll meet you at the shuttle, sir. Let's roll. Hey! You need authorization to enter this area. Agh! Get them! Agh! Good job, Gregor. Look, he's up there! Just keep moving. It is all under control. I'm beginning to remember how much I hate these guys. Hey, I don't recognize those astromechs. Blast them! They are on to us. Colonel, can you hear me? Save yourselves! Okay. Whoa! Agh! Whoa-oh-oh. Did everybody make it? No, Beezee and the colonel are still out there. Get the shuttle ready to roll. Agh! Colonel, you all right? I'll never make it back alive. Yes, you will, sir. This is what I was born to do. Now, go before it's too late. It's been an honor serving with you, Colonel. Artoo's right. We can swing back around and pick you up. Don't worry about me. You made me remember who I am. I'll make my way home. I promise. Now go! Where is Gregor? Where is Gregor? He's doing what a soldier does: sacrificing himself for the lives of others. You will be remembered, Captain Gregor. We will take your heroic story back to the Republic, and we will watch for your return.   \n                "}, "Corruption": {"episode": "s03e05", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe challenge of hope is to overcome corruption. Desperate times on Mandalore! Having won neutrality for the Mandalorian system, Duchess Satine now finds herself an outsider with little aid to her people. Supplies are impossible to come by, except on the black market. As a result, the Duchess faces a world consumed by greed. Hoping to alleviate some of the tensions rising on the capital city of Sundari, Satine has called upon her friend Padm\u00c3\u00a9 Amidala to make a diplomatic visit. Senator. Duchess, it's good to see you. Thank you for coming, padme. I know our decision to stay neutral has caused distress in the senate. But for many here, the fallout from your war has been too much. If your government has trade concerns, we can talk. Many systems have been affected. I assure you not everyone in the Republic has neglected Mandalore, and there are those of us who would still vote, to give you any help you require. The help we need now is opening trade routes so we may get supplies more freely. We are making progress in the senate. Forgive me, padme. I did not bring you here to discuss politics. I had hoped to show you the new mandalore. Not the typical mandalorian welcome. Senator organa teased you'd have a royal court waiting. I just wanted to greet you myself, before the others. Now, this is a mandalorian Welcome. We are a people of tradition. Hurry up. Get that stuff unloaded quickly. Here comes the customs official. Nice day here on Mandalore. It is. Let's try not to ruin it. I don't get your meaning. I think you do. Your arrival isn't listed here on my schedule. So what exactly are you unloading on my dock? Must be a clerical oversight. I'm sure it won't happen again. Normally there would be five times as many officers out here. They're off at the parade. Some big shot just arrived On mandalore. You're lucky. Oh, luck has nothing to do with it. Well, just in case, deal with me directly in the future. Got it? as you wish. Esteemed colleagues, leaders of mandalore, friends, I'm afraid our neutrality has caused our people to suffer. The war between the separatists and the republic rages across Our galaxy. It has caused trade routes to be closed to mandalore And has forced us to turn to a black market filled with corruption. We know what is happening, Almec. - What will be done about it? - Mandalore should not need, to pay smugglers to feed its people. It's not that we want to deal with smugglers. We have no alternative. I'm sure you and the trade Federation make a profit whether our business is legitimate or not. - I resent that! - ladies and gentlemen, please, order. Please. prime minister almec seems a bit overwhelmed. Your services as a negotiator, please, be my guest. Perhaps they will listen to a new voice. Ruling council, may I speak? Senator amidala. The floor is yours. I hear your worries, your frustration, But the longer you argue, the more your people suffer. You are right. New trade routes are essential to survival, but the black market is no substitute for legitimate and legal trade. - What would you propose, Senator? -  The republic can provide Security. The republic's own dealings with the black market - far surpass mandalore's. - I agree. To come here, a member of the Republic senate, and lecture to us about corruption. The corporate alliance controls everything. Silence! I told senator amidala that Mandalore was not part of the War, yet here I find a battle in my own palace. I call this meeting adjourned. We will reconvene and allow cooler heads to prevail. Come on, you worms. Get those barrels inside. What is this stuff? This stuff is slabin, A diluting agent. If we add it, we can make twice as much tea at twice the profit. Isn't it toxic? Only if the dosage is wrong, so get your mixture right. Tell me, padme, how do you feel about the republic's war with the separatists? It's so complicated. As you know, in the senate, the chancellor says it's going very well but my sources say otherwise. and how does that make you feel? there are times I wish I could follow mandalore's lead, neutrality, and not just in the war. But the politics as well? The contamination of greed reaches deep and far within the republic, corporations, trade guilds, Too many senators serving their own interests. There are still those of us who work to overcome the corruption and, believe it to be possible. Enough of this dreary talk. A new hospital has opened. Tomorrow you and I shall visit, see true good at work. It will do us good. Orderly, what's going on here? I have no idea, madam. Dr. Zaz is handling the Outbreak. He's inside. What is happening here? Duchess, I'm sorry no one has come to speak to you. - These children have been Poisoned. - How? We don't know. I'm afraid. We've gotten reports from across the planet. Have you identified a cause? The children here all came from the same school. We're testing their food. If we find something, perhaps we can create an antidote. But it will take some time. Which they may not have. What if it's not a poison? - It must be death watch. - I'm not so sure. In the past, the death watch attacks have only been directed at myself and the administration, not the children. They are terrorists. Perhaps the senator's visit has inspired them. Terrorists? Our minds should be on the sick children that are dying in the streets. What are you going to do to save them? I must speak to the ruling council about this matter. I refuse to believe that Death Watch has anything to do with this. I agree. His concern for the children was practically none. All he thinks about is politics. Well, we can't just sit here and do nothing. My thoughts exactly. Thank you all for coming. I suppose you're wondering why I asked you here. As my personal guards, you are the only ones I can trust to investigate this matter. We have little time. That is why I have asked for your help. Padme? Each of you will be getting a special comlink and datapad, Means of direct communication, and location you should investigate. This must be a closed-loop affair. Hundreds of children have been poisoned. they are our children, and they need our help. This is a mandalorian matter, And we must find out who dares poison our children. Thank you. Thank you all. - So where do we start? - The schools. Thank you for allowing us to inspect the school, superintendent. My pleasure, duchess. We've cleared the food here. None of it is tainted. What about what they ate yesterday? the menu of food is pretty regular here. We would've caught something with our tests. What about their drinks, Doctor? No, they drink fresh water. It's impossible for it to be tainted. Not the water. What about the bottled drinks? Those are not part of the school's menu. They are allowed through an outside vendor. Excuse me, child. I must borrow your drink. How could this have happened? It's not your fault. I appreciate that. However, for an outbreak of this size to occur, I'm afraid it's a sign of a much, much deeper seeded - corruption than I had imagined. - Duchess, we found something. This tea contains a high level of slabin. I didn't know slabin was lethal. it usually isn't, but mixed with the tea, and at this concentration, I'm certain it's the cause of the children's Illness. The school must have an import log, correct? Yes. I believe so. So we should be able to find out where the tea came from. Well, then let's get to the docks. Everything's here, satine. Everything except the records for the tea shipments. It looks like the school's import log has been erased. There's no record of an outside vendor. superintendent, hold it right there! I'm actually on my way to the hospital. I have to go. Stop him! Tell me what's going on here, Or else my guards will not be as - Satine - Padme, please. Where did you get the tea? Please, I never meant to harm anyone. I just-- I needed to cut costs. The school's budget was too low. The school has received sufficient government funding. Look, they offered me a great deal. I could keep some money for myself too, but I didn't know that the drinks were poison. All this because you were greedy? I am not the only one making money off this operation. There are others more guilty than I am. Was death watch involved? Death Watch? I don't know. I dealt with a middleman, an importer. His name's Siddiq. He works for a shipping company not too far from here. Tell us where. Sure, I bribed the school official. What's the problem? What you've done is illegal. Beyond these stars, there's a war going on. As long as my company imports goods, most people turn a blind eye to anything else. We are not most people, Mr. Siddiq. my corporate contracts protect me, Duchess, So I'll play your little game. Look, I'm sorry there are sick children. I truly am. But I'm just a messenger. Where do yoget the tea? From mooga. The commerce guild controls it. Here, I have nothing to hide. Here we are. Shipping schedules from mooga. Right there, the highlighted ones. And a customs official reports these to the government? As far as I know. Are these all for the ones bringing in the tea? No, I'd have to narrow that down. Okay, okay. No problem. There you go. Look, they're actually bringing in a shipment tonight. You want to know which dock? I must say, when I came to visit, hadn't pictured us in such an informal setting. Yes, well, from what master Kenobi tells me, During your tenure as queen, you became quite familiar with such excursions. one can only survive the rigors of courtly formalities for so long. We are of the same mind. Duchess, there's a shipment arriving. The smugglers. - We'll soon find out. - Shall I call in more security? No, let's wait and see what transpires. Look, a customs official. Welcome back, gentlemen. I'm here for myInspection. Certainly. How can they operate with such impunity? I need to find out how far up the chain of command this corruption goes. I'm sorry, duchess, but what you're saying, It's impossible. impossible? We witnessed it with our own eyes. Bribery of a customs official at the shipping docks? I'm afraid not. The docks are a highly secure area, free of dangerous criminals. but not free of corruption. The most dangerous weapon in the galaxy is money, captain. Smuggling does not take place on my watch. And what about when you're not watching? I'm always watching, senator. and were you watching as children were dying? Who was watching then? - Duchess, with all due respect - No, captain. If you want my respect, you will arrest these criminals and stop stalling. Stalling? Why else would you not be down there, with a patrol unit making arrests, unless you're involved? All right. We'll see what's going on. Satine, what are those guards doing here? - Did you order them here? Duchess, I've been with you the whole time. Guards, let us into this warehouse. We're under strict orders not to let anyone in. Do you know who this is? I command you, open these doors. Arrest them! Hold it right there. Impressive shooting for a senator. Captain, I want you to burn down this warehouse. Excuse me? - But there's evidence-- - Burn it down, or I'll consider you a part of this conspiracy, captain. You heard her, men. Burn the warehouse. It wasn't death watch, Prime minister. It was a group of black market Smugglers. They were diluting the drink with slabin. What they didn't count on was, the process would make the drinks poisonous. And what about the sick children? I ordered shipments of the antidote for all the schools and hospitals. I'm glad this is over. No, I'm afraid it's not over. The corruption we witnessed is intolerable. Payoffs, police unwilling to comply, my government fooled How does this happen? I'm sorry. I'm setting up a committee to look into it. Children nearly died because our government cannot be counted on. I assure you this will not go unpunished. I'm counting on you, Almec. I'm troubled, padme. You heard prime minster almec say he'll investigate. His heart is in the right place, but this corruption - You must have hope, satine. - Hope will only go so far. The very people conducting this investigation might be corrupt. Perhaps a jedi working undercover at the academy could be of service to us And in more ways than one, For if we lose our young, Mandalore will indeed be lost. I will speak With master yoda. Don't lose hope, my friend. - Senator. - Duchess.   \n                "}, "Brothers": {"episode": "s04e21", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA darkness awakes! Count Dooku's bitter betrayal of his former apprentice, Asajj Ventress, resulted in the creation of a new menace in the galaxy, Savage Opress. Caught in a deadly game of revenge between Ventress and Dooku, Savage barely escaped the carnage. Beaten and alone he returned to Mother Talzin, his creator, who gave him a new quest to pursue his long-lost brother. I can sense him, Grievous. That creature, Savage Opress, is growing stronger and stronger as each day passes. You consider him a threat? He is a threat to all of us! Even the Jedi! With the Nightsisters eradicated, there is no one left to control him. Something is rising, something sinister. He's choking her. - Hey! - Let her go! He's choking her. Hurry up! Call the authorities! Mother Talzin, this dust, it's a clue. Yes, Savage, you are getting closer and closer. Soon you and your brother will be reunited. I must make the necessary preparations. So he hands me a blaster about a fourth the size Cheers. Why so tense? - I'm not sure. I thought I sensed someone from my past. Who is this someone? A monster. Huh. Hey! What are you doing here? Get outta here! I'm about to take off! The cargo you just dropped off, what planet did it come from? The junk fields on planet Lotho Minor! - Take me there. - Okay! Okay!

Tensions run high on the ocean world of Mon Calamari where two separate peoples, the aggressive squid-like Quarren, and their peaceful neighbor, the Mon Calamari, struggle to maintain a fragile coexistence. Adding to this strife, the king of the Mon Calamari has been found mysteriously murdered, leaving his young son Prince Lee-Char to guide his people alone. But the Quarren race will not accept the new ruler as their king. Senator Amidala and her Jedi bodyguard have arrived to help resolve the matter and to avoid plunging the planet into civil war. You've all prospered under our rule! It's time for a change! The prince's rule has been preordained! Down with this monarchy! We'll defend our right for a Mon Cala king! - We want a Quarren king! - Down with the Mon Cala! Power to the Quarren! I am dedicated to serving the Quarren as well as my own people, the Mon Calamari. Silence! You haven't earned the right to speak at this gathering! You have no say in the matter, Ambassador, you are only here as an observer for the Separatists. Do not forget I am here at the request of the Quarren because you, Captain, demanded the presence of the Republic. Such a disgrace, I'll give you a lesson in manners. Prince Lee-Char will bring the planet to ruin! The boy has neither the experience nor the knowledge to lead. Please, you're here to find a compromise. What can the Republic do to help keep the peace? This is a matter between the Quarren and the Mon Cala. Yeah, who asked you? - The Republic has no place here! - Down with the Republic! We refuse to support the coronation of another Mon Cala king. I'm sorry. Ambassador? It is my opinion the Quarren have no further business here. Come on, Captain Ackbar, we have to contact Master Yoda. Your father was my trusted friend. I am sorry for your loss. This civil war, is it inevitable? Sadly so, Master Yoda. The Separatist ambassador came here to stir up the Quarren and that's exactly what he did. It's only a matter of time before the Quarren withdraw from the Republic. I suspect behind this, Count Dooku is. The Mon Calamari system is still part of the Republic. This planet must not fall into Separatist hands. I'll dispatch Master Fisto and your Padawan, Tano, along with a company of clones, they'll be at your side by day's end. In the meantime, Captain, assemble the Mon Cala troops and prepare for a Quarren assault. The troops are being assembled, Senator. Let's hope we don't need them, Captain. I'm entrusting the safety of Prince Lee-Char to your hands. You must remain at his side at all times as his personal bodyguard. Senator, if the boy is to We are on the verge of a civil war, Captain. And that boy is the Supreme Commander of Mon Cala's military. It's up to you to see that he remains safe and that he can handle the job. With due respect, Senator, the prince is not ready to lead an army. He needs training. You have your orders, Captain. You are right, Captain, I am not trained to lead an army. Come on, Your Highness, we have a war to win. The army has assembled, Count Dooku. Well done, Tamson. What about the Quarren leader? The Quarren leader is on board 100%. He will deliver the planet into your hands just as you said he would. Very good, Commander, in the end, control of this planet will be in your hands. Proceed as planned. In this time of crisis, our king has something to say. I know many of you agree with the Quarren, that I am too young to rule. But I assure you I will use all my strength and all my abilities to lead us through this challenge. We are a great people, and I will do all I can to negotiate peace without bloodshed. I do not believe the Quarren will attack. Attack! - It's an attack! - Take cover. - The prince! The prince is here! - He's joining the battle. Captain! What are your orders, Your Highness? Stay where you are and hold the line. If I may suggest, Captain, we should take the prince to a safer place until the Republic reinforcements arrive. That's impossible. That is a decision only the prince can make. He is our leader. This is horrible. Your Highness, this is not a wise decision. And you know it. Forget your tradition. This is war! Majesty? I have to stay here with my people. Press your attack, Captain. Soldiers of Mon Calamari, this is your home. Do not let it fall! I need to get some troops behind those Separatist droids. Come on, I know a shortcut. - We should come out right behind them. - Good plan. Look out! What do we do now? Well, we got to come up with another plan. Any ideas? Our only choice now is to wait for the Jedi reinforcements. Blue Leader, standing by. Red Leader, standing by. All squadrons are in position, General Fisto. You may deploy when ready. Commencing deployment now. Three, two, one, mark. Reinforcements! Finally! Anakin, I'm going to look for Senator Tills. Hopefully she's still alive. Be careful. Look out! Stay down and don't move.

You got it, Master. - Grab on! - Good idea. Get us out of here! - Hang on! - I am! I am! I'm slipping! Look out! They're coming right at us! I'm letting go! Look out! Behind you! As long as we're in the tube we're safe. Look! The prince! Hurry! They are returning to their ships. We seem to have won this round. We are lucky to have survived the first assault. They could've easily overrun us with their droids. The droids are taking up position in the coral. Probably amassing for another assault. Why would they hide in the coral? NOSSOR Rl: Your aqua-droids are no match for the Mon Calamari. What makes you think these secret weapons you've brought from your home world will fare any better? They are half-machine, half-monster. We call them Hydroid Medusas. They are invincible. - Prince Lee-Char! - Senator Tills, I'm glad to see you're safe. You must prepare to dictate terms for a Quarren surrender. - Surrender? - Not so fast, Senator. I know the Quarren, they won't surrender. We may have won the first battle, Your Highness, but it won't be the last. It's only a matter of time before they launch another assault. I sense the real battle is about to begin. We have no defense against those. This isn't going to be easy. All troops, battle stations! Do not fire until the prince gives the command. Steady, steady. Not yet. Now, Your Highness! Attack! Ahsoka, find a way out of here! Prince, where's somewhere safe? We can't retreat, not now. We've got to be brave. There's a time to attack and a time to retreat, and now is not the time to be brave. The safest place is in the caves. I agree, Your Highness, follow me. Anakin! Go! I'll hold them off. Come on. Keep going! Don't stop! Search the area for survivors. Secure the perimeter. What took your squids so long? I didn't think you and your Separatist droids would need backup. Your reputation is a little exaggerated. Exaggeration is a weapon of war. It's what helped deliver the enemy into your hands. Then let's be thankful this is our day, a victorious day that Disobey a command from Count Dooku again and I will kill you where you stand. Thanks to you, Padawan Tano, and to these brave soldiers. I wish I could've done more for my people. Maybe then we would've been spared all of this, the illusion that I could actually lead in my father's place. Your father would be proud of you. Proud? We lost! Today, you learned the hardest lesson a commander can learn, how to live to fight another day.   \n                "}, "Mercy Mission": {"episode": "s04e05", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tGlobal crisis! The Mid Rim planet ofAleen is devastated by catastrophic earthquakes. As the people struggle, the future of the survivors rests on their ability to rekindle a way of life from the rubble of the past. A Jedi transport, on a mission to block Separatist annexation of the Qiilura system, is waylaid to provide desperately needed humanitarian relief to the people on the surface ofAleen. Commander Wolffe, we've been waiting for your report. We've located clusters of life forms on the planet's surface, Senator. There are thousands of survivors. That is good news. The Aleena will be very glad to see you. Yes, well, my orders are to get them on the path to rebuilding and move on. General Plo needs reinforcements as soon as possible. Your orders stand. With hope leave them, but return to the war you must. Yes, sir. We'll start landing procedures immediately. Huh, really? Must you be so rough? What, you think this is rough? Wait till we get to the surface. Traipsing through a natural disaster zone is not my kind of diversion, Artoo. You may be game for adventure. I certainly am not. - Oh! - Suck it up, Shiney. That will leave a mark. Great, it's gonna be another one of those planets. Okay. Who packed the translator droid? Hello. Hello. I'm here, Commander. Oh, hello. My, a local custom, I suppose. Interesting. - Ah, did you get that? - Certainly, I did. Commander Wolffe, you have the honor of meeting King Manchucho. His message, simply put is, \"Welcome to our disaster. Glad you could come.\" They will save us and feed our stomachs. The Gods below will know peace once more. They are expressing gratitude, Commander, and the chant is a rather flowery way of asking, \"What's for dinner?\" Oh, oh. Commander, we're experiencing some settling from the original event. It's to be expected. An aftershock, everyone. No, no. Please remain calm. I repeat. Well. Yes, yes. Yes, thank you. It wasn't actually me, but thank you anyway. Trooper squads, scan for unstable ground. Mark unsafe areas. Let's get these cans unloaded. Access and repair of their mainframe computers is job one. The R2-unit has uploaded the Republic's reboot manuals with instructions on how to make the equipment we're leaving operational. They are asking if we would \"Make peace in the ground.\" We're good, but not that good. - Sinker! - Commander. Take your team, the R2-unit and a couple of Aleena to the mainframe station. Let's get them back online. On it, sir. All right, little fellas, let's go. Looks like the rubble is blocking the entry. I got this. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Boost, you want what's left of the place crashing down on our heads? You worry too much. I could've done that! After you, little guy. Run metrics on structural degradation, will you? Did you find anything? All right, let's get the download started. Another quake? Coming here was a bad idea. I'm beginning to agree with you. We've marked out areas for a temporary hospital and a communal kitchen here. The Aleena feel great shame. He is saying, first, peace must be restored. We must go inside Under Inside. He says no to the kitchen. This is a relief mission. Indeed. Perhaps, they do not allow eating in public. Do I need this? Here's how it is. My orders are to deliver supplies and reestablish power and communication systems. Report back to the transport the moment that R2-unit has completed the download. Tell them we'll be out of their hair in no time. Splendid. A firm hand. Well done, Commander, if I may say. Well done. Download in progress, Commander. Excellent. Report back to the staging area. We need all hands on deck. The droid can finish up. On our way, sir. All right, Artoo, stay here and monitor the download and get back to the ship as soon as possible. Watch your step, Shiney. Impossible clones. Hello. What have we here? Something to show us? I see no reason why not, time permitting, of course. Rather impatient creatures, aren't they? A little diplomacy goes a long way. Of course you wouldn't understand. But there is no harm in humoring them. Yes, yes, yes, we're coming. We're coming. Artoo, keep your sensor on them, just in case. Oh, my! Oh, yes, I see. A sacred treasure indeed, to be excavated and examined at a later stage with the proper equipment. Better to stay at a safe distance, thank you. I have a bad feeling about this. Artoo! Artoo, is that you? I suppose that could have been worse. Oh, my! Now, it is. There must be some way out of here. Setting foot on this planet was a mistake in the first place. We belong on Senator Amidala's balcony, watching Coruscant's glorious moons rise above the City of Spires What was that? Wait, no. Shut Shut it off. Daylight. We're saved. I knew I would find a way out. Look, little guy, we're doing everything we can. Has anyone seen the translator droid? Okay. That's fine with me. Whatever. Did you see that? It's an ambush. We're under attack. Get these bugs off. Get off! Artoo, help! Okay. Stop! Stop! Okay, that's quite enough. Sometimes, Artoo, you go too far. Why have you come? I believe this tree is talking to us. You do not belong. I heartily agree. Being here is a terrible mistake. Go! Leave us to rest! We will be happily on our way if you would just point us in the right direction. Why have the surface dwellers destroyed the peace? To be accurate, the quakes did that. The ground shakes to keep out their foul air, which poisons and destroys us. The quakes have caused many to die, that is why we have come to help. How? However we can. There is not much time. Find what you were sent here to do. Ask Orphne. She will know. Yes, yes, yes, on our way to see Orphne directly. Artoo, let's get out of here. My ocular sensors seem to be malfunctioning. Certainly, I remember. He said the surface dwellers destroyed the peace. I don't know. Look, let's find this Orphne. It seems she has all the answers. Oh, my Pardon me, madam. Oh I can't eat you. Well, that's a relief. If you are Orphne, we have come to ask How to get back? Well, yes. We have lost our way. There is a covenant between the Aleena of old and our subterranean world. We survive because the ground keeps us apart. But you are apart. No. The divide was breached when they attacked our most sacred site. Attacked? Without going through the natural filtering process, the surface air is deadly to us. We caused the quakes that followed. But so many on the surface have died. We are not destroyers by nature, but we must do what is in our power to seal the breach. We can seal the breach, just tell us where it is. We can help. If you have come to help us, you will help. If you are meant to return to the surface, you will find your way. What? But this is a dead end. You can't keep us here. This is an outrage. Your destiny is your own. Perhaps it is through your desire to survive that your greater purpose will be revealed. You can run, but cannot walk. You have a mouth, but cannot talk. You have a head, but never weep. You have a bed, but never sleep. Ask yourself, who are you? Wait. Wait, Orphne! Don't go! Artoo, we're doomed. I don't know. What was the breach that she spoke of? What was broken? Artoo, hurry, replay Orphne's message. Yes, riddle. I know it's a riddle. That's what we're trying to figure out, what the riddle means. Just play it back, would you? You can run, but cannot walk. You have a mouth, but cannot talk. You have a head, but never weep. You have a bed, but never sleep. Run, but cannot walk. Yes. Have a mouth, but cannot talk. Hmm. Don't worry, Artoo, I'll figure it out very soon. Riddles are my specialty. Let's see. Cannot walk. A mouth, but cannot talk. What? Fire? It isn't fire. Let me think. Soil? Of course it's not soil! What are you going on about? I nearly had it. Water? Artoo, will you stop your mumbling and let me think. What are you doing now? This is no time to clean up. All this water. I detest getting wet! Water. Water. A river. A river! Artoo, it's a river! That's it, I have figured it out. It is a river. River is the magic word. Look, it's working! Oh, quick, Artoo, quick. This might be our ticket out of here. You've figured it out? How could you Artoo, we've made it! We're saved! Oh, my! The vapors! Look, Artoo. Do you see? That is why the Aleena cannot seal the breach, the air below the ground is deadly to them, but it has no effect on us. I understand, Artoo. I finally understand! They are waiting for us to help them. They need us. We must do what we should have done in the first place. We must block the hole which leads to the underworld using that seal. That is the breach that Orphne spoke of. Go, Artoo! You can do it! What do you mean I have to help? No, you are right, Artoo. Oh, oh, oh! You are welcome. I knew we would be able to help. Hey, Shiney! You two finished with those repairs on the computer system? My good sir, you may not realize it, but we have been on quite an adventure. Really? Quite an adventure, huh? Get a load of this one. One? Which one? What What do you Just come on, the Commander's been looking for you. You are most welcome, Your Majesty. Just doing our job in the service of the Republic. No, Artoo, I will tell the story. No one understands you, anyway. It's only proper. I am the one who solved the riddle, I should be the one to relay the story. I will, of course, report on your individual heroics. Do you think Senator Amidala will hold As soon as we rendezvous with Master Gallia, we're off-loading those two. I couldn't agree more, sir. Himself shall attend. Dare to dream, Artoo.

Republic forces are locked in heated combat with the droid armada on a massive space station that encircles an entire planet. Anakin Skywalker valiantly leads his men against the onslaught, which has lasted several rotations with neither side gaining any ground. Aided by the twin sister Jedi Masters Tiplee and Tiplar, the Republic now mounts a desperate offensive to break the deadlock. Push forward! Stay to my left. Fives! Watch out! Thanks, brother. I owe you one. You owe me a lot more than one. Tighten our flank! Shields up!  Yes, sir! Don't get too comfortable. This battle hasn't been won yet. Master Skywalker, we must get to the command post. Admiral Trench has sent for reinforcements. We must take this post before they arrive. It's time for phase two. We're at this position. Tiplar, you'll take your men down this passageway. Tiplee, you'll move along here. They'll have to divide their forces to counter us. And when they do, Rex and I will press through the middle. If we time it right, we'll all converge on this spot at the same time, and the droids won't know what hit them. If we're making a run, we'll need backup. My men are severely depleted. Fives, you and Tup take ten of your best men - and support Master Tiplar. - We're on it, sir. - Hey, you all right? - Yeah. - I I just - Come on. This is a textbook battle. We've run through this a million times before in training. Yeah, I know. I just I don't feel like myself. What do you mean? - Follow me. - Jedi. Tup, what's the matter with you? Uh, nothing. I'm fine. Come on, brother. Don't want to be left behind. Increase our defenses. We must hold them here. Don't fall back! Push forward! Tup, hey, this is not the time to freeze up. Pull it together. We're almost to the finish line. Come on! Jedi. Good soldiers follow orders. - Hey, Tup! - On your right! Tup, no! Sister! Hold your position! Destroyers! We've lost our momentum. Fall back! Fives, I don't know what's going on, but you are responsible for Tup now. Get him back to base. I want answers. The Jedi have withdrawn their forces. Contact Count Dooku immediately. I have something he'll be very interested in. Count Dooku, the Republic forces are in full retreat. But this is not why you have contacted me, is it? No, Count. In truth, the Republic had pushed my droids to the breaking point when they suddenly turned and fell back. It seemed that at the height of the conflict, a clone turned on his Jedi General and executed her. Intentionally? I saw it with my own eyes. I have studied clones and fought against them in many battles. This action is unlike anything I have witnessed in their behavior as soldiers. So there is a traitor in their midst. It's rare, but such things have been reported in the past. Not a traitor. This was different, it seemed. Yes, Admiral? It seemed as if the clone could not help himself, as if he was entranced. Thank you, Admiral. I will take this under advisement. Why? Why would he do this? I'm about to find out. How's he doing, Rex? I'm not sure, General. It seems like he just snapped. - Tup, can you hear me? - Yes, Captain. - What happened? - What do you mean? Do you have any idea what you've done? Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. - What is he talking about? - I have no idea. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers follow orders. Kill the Jedi. Ah! We have to get him back to the medical bay before he hurts anyone else. My lord, I have received a report that leads me to conclude we may have encountered a grave complication with one of our assets. Assets? Yes, sir. A clone trooper has executed one of the Jedi generals. And you believe this is indicative of our programming? I do, my lord. But I cannot be certain. It is pertinent we ascertain if this is an isolated event, a failure in this particular clone's programming. Otherwise, my plans may be ruined. Seize the clone immediately. Yes, my master. Fives, what's happening to me? - You don't remember? - No. - You murdered General Tiplar. - What? No. That's not possible. I would never I could never - Tup, you did. - I don't I don't understand. How could this happen? What's happening to me, Fives? Ah! Ah! No! No! What do you think happened? - Did you check all of his scans? - Well, all of his scans are clear. As far as I can tell, this is a combat-related stress. It seems he's had some sort of breakdown. Kix, you should know better. We were designed to withstand any stress. I agree. We've been through a lot together. He doesn't seem to remember what happened. It's like he's sick or drugged. Well, it could be a virus, a toxin. I can't be certain. Let's talk outside. You mean the enemy could've made him do this? It's a possibility. There have been rumors that Separatists have been trying to develop an anti-clone virus biological warfare. Listen, we aren't equipped for this type of situation. He'll have to be taken back to Kamino. Only then will you have your answer. Wait, wait! Tup, it's gonna be fine, I promise. They'll fix you up real good. We'll be having a drink together in no time, eh? Good soldiers follow orders. Good soldiers - You are a good soldier, Tup. - It's time to go now. - Be careful. - Yes, General. We are tracking clean. Calculating hyperspace jump in five, four Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. Scanners indicate incoming craft. Abort jump! Mayday! Mayday! The enemy has cut us off. They must've circled around behind us. We're being overwhelmed. Can't let 'em in here. Hold that line. Here they come! Blast 'em! General Skywalker, you're nearing the coordinates where we lost contact with the shuttle.  We can see it now. It doesn't look good. Look like some buzz droids got on the hull and opened it right up. Hmm. Strategically, this attack doesn't make any sense. Unless they were after something specific. - Tup! - I'm going over there. We're coming with you. Over here. This is Tup's gurney. The restraints have been cut. The clankers took Tup? Why? They must be responsible for whatever's happening to him. It's possible. All I know is, they went to great lengths to capture him, and that means something. We have got to get him back. Don't worry. We'll find a way. We have captured the clone, Count. Good work, Admiral. Send him to me immediately. And under all circumstances, keep him alive. Yes, sir. Get him on the next shuttle out of here. - But the Republic blockade - See to it personally, Commander. It will be just three of us going in. The shuttle will drop us off just short of the main hangar. Then we space-walk from there. Are you picking anything up on Tup's locator? I've got a faint signal, but it's hard to track. - It's moving. - Then we'd better hurry. I've got a better signal. Tup is heading this way. They're moving him to the hangar. - Are your scopes Jedi-issue, sir? - Stay focused, Fives. - There he is, sir. - We'll have to work fast.  There must be a hundred droids in that hangar, not to mention the starfighters. This is stretching it even for you, sir. Rex, you're beginning to sound like Obi-Wan. You got a better idea? Look, I don't doubt you could pull it off, but I'm just not sure Fives and I would be around to see it happen. - I've got an idea. - Well, let's hear it. Quickly! Grappling gun. Good thinking. - Get ready to hold on. - That's why he's the ARC trooper. - Is there a problem? - We were experiencing some drag, but the sensors are stabilized now. You were experiencing drag in the vacuum of space? Yeah, strange. But it is gone now. Scrap 'em! Hey, now we're experiencing turbul What's going on? What do you know about this clone? I am programmed to resist intimidation. Fine. - How's he doing? - Not well. Not well at all. I think he's dying, sir. We have to get him to Kamino. I'll want a full report from Kamino. If Tup is the victim of some Separatist plot, we have no idea of how widespread it already is. Permission to come with you, sir. He's my best friend. - You may need help. - But everything must be done by the book. Understood, sir. You're to stay by his side at all times. - I don't want any more slipups. - Yes, sir. - Good. - Let's go.  Medical frigate 517, you are cleared for departure. Good luck, boys.   \n                "}, "Fugitive": {"episode": "s06e03", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t Cause of death unknown! Kaminoan Doctor Nala Se was unable to find the cause of an illness in clone trooper Tup. In a desperate attempt to save his friend's life, Fives located and removed a tumor from Tup's brain with the help of Medical droid AZI-3. Immediately following the procedure, Tup died, and Fives was placed under arrest. Now the tumor is the only hope to finding answers for Tup's mysterious illness. General, what did the Chancellor say? Supreme Chancellor Palpatine wants the tumor and all of the intel gathered sent to the Grand Republic Medical Facility on Coruscant. So then I'll be going to Coruscant as well? You were not a part of the Chancellor's request. I'm sorry, Fives, but this is a matter best left to the medical professionals. There is still so much we do not know. Perhaps we would know more if this clone had not taken matters into his own hands. Listen! I was trying to save my friend! And yet perhaps by removing this tumor, it was you who killed him. What do you care? You were going to kill him anyway and dissect him too. He's a soldier. He deserves better! Stand down, Fives! Doctor, there is no proof of your claim. I want this specimen and all the data prepared for transit to the Jedi Temple. The Chancellor said the tumor and data was to be sent directly to the Medical Facility on Coruscant, not the Jedi Temple. And it will get there, but after the Jedi have run an analysis on it first. I protest. I must personally deliver the tumor to the Chancellor as ordered. You can protest all you want. My word is final. You have one more physical to pass. If you are cleared, you will be sent back to the 501st. Thank you, General. It will be good to put this entire incident behind you, trooper. I agree. AZI-3. Hello, ARC trooper Fives. I regret that we were unable to heal your friend. Yeah, me too. Are you going to be reprogrammed as well? No, AZI, I'm going back to the front. That is not what I heard. I heard your mind was going to be wiped and that you would reassigned here and placed on sanitation detail. We can still be friends, assuming we both remember each other after our memories have been erased. Let's go, CT-5555. No! Look what you did! I cannot believe what you did. I am not getting my mind erased, and neither are you. Let's get out of here! Are we escaping? Oh-oh-oh! Why are we here? I knew it. Nala Se switched the cases. She's trying to hide something. Oh, the tumor? So we are going to continue our research? Yeah, the research. That's it. Now, come on! Whoa! I'm sorry, sir. All ships are locked down during the emergency. Oh, what about that one? Hey! There they are! Sorry, brother. I want him brought in alive. Have that ship tracked. Yes, ma'am. Can you float? I am buoyant and have several survival modes. Ah, survival, eh? Autopilot engaged. Navigation and orbit set. Wait. What are you doing? I thought we were escaping. Nope, this is a diversion. I need them to chase this pod while we go back and investigate the cause of Tup's death. Any more questions, doctor? Actually, yes, now that you mention it AZI! AZI! Now what? We're going back to figure out why Tup died. I can get us there much faster. Oh! You're just full of surprises, aren't you? This is one of my various survival modes. I am equipped to Droids. A \"thank you\" would have been nice. Lord Tyranus, you summoned me? Prime Minister Lama Su tells me there has been a complication. What has happened to the inhibitor chip? It was stolen by a renegade clone. What does this clone know? Nothing as of yet. He is just a soldier after all, however he was a friend to the clone which malfunctioned. This behavior is unsettling. First the malfunctioning clone, and now a renegade. Are you certain these soldiers will live up to your design in the end? I am certain. The malfunction to the inhibitor chip is an aberration. And how do you explain the renegade? I'm afraid the Jedi have inspired creative thinking in some of the clones. That is the cause of this type of divergent behavior. Will this interfere with protocol 66? No, I am certain of that. Find the renegade clone immediately, and make sure you recover the chip. The true nature of the inhibitor chip must not be discovered by the Jedi. Yes, Lord Tyranus. What Oh. Once we're inside, I need you to get me a change of clothes, AZI. Trooper, I think I saw the renegade clone head into the storage room. All right, let's check it out. I think he was over there. We need to get the tumor analyzed. Follow me. This is the Genetic Records Hall. It contains data on the original DNA of every being we have ever cloned. We will compare the tumor's DNA versus that of Jango Fett, the original donor. If any tumor like this has been noted before, we will find it. The tumor, please. Nothing. What? The sample doesn't match anything found in the Jango Fett genotype. Furthermore, it is not even completely organic. It is foreign to the body. Someone implanted it there. An implant? You mean this isn't an accident? Someone did this to Tup? Precisely. There have been no unauthorized ships leaving Kamino, General. I sense we are looking in the wrong place. We have a report from the Genetic Records Hall. Explain. Someone is accessing the Jango Fett genotype. It's them. Evacuate that room quietly. Is there another way out of here, besides the door we came in? Yes, there are emergency access hatches in every major room in case of flooding. Good. Let's get moving. There! It's no good. They've sealed it from the inside. Station your men at every access point back into the main hallway system. Yes, ma'am. Did you get all the information you needed? Mostly. We know that the tumor is a foreign material and was implanted for an unknown reason. However, there is still so much we do not know about it. For example, at what stage was it introduced to clone Tup? And why? What is this thing? Why would someone put it in Tup? I believe this is an organic chip built out of cells. But what's it for? I do not know. Ah, thanks. I need to find out if what was in Tup's head is in mine. We have already done a scan and But it was missed in Tup, and it could have been missed in me too. You have to take it out. We cannot be 100% sure if the chip is even there. I know it's there. It is a dangerous surgery. Look, you got it out of Tup. You can get it out of me. He died after I removed the chip. Maybe it is connected. You may die too. It's a chance I have to take. I trust you. All right, I will do it. Let us go to a sterile facility. Hold still. This will not hurt a bit. Ah! You do you know what you're doing, right? Why, yes. I have been programmed to perform over 100 All right, all right. Let's do this. You will only be unconscious for a few minutes. There's no sign of them, General. They must have escaped by now. Escape was never their intention. They're investigating, searching. Their appearance in the Genetics labs proves this, but what are they searching for? Well? Was it was it there? Yes. Identical in structure. However, it appears that the one I found in your friend had malfunctioned, while yours is perfectly intact. Are you sure his breakdown wasisolated? There is no way of knowing that. And now that we have removed your chip, we do not know what will happen to you. So then I could snap too? Possibly. But when we removed the chip from Tup, he I am afraid you may die as well. I need to know if more clones than just Tup and I have these and when we were implanted with them. My analysis suggests implantation took place at the earliest stage of development, most likely when you and Tup were only embryos. Then we have to start there. Oh, great. Try to act normal. Normal?  Doo-da-la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  Hello! How was that? Was that normal? For you, AZI, yeah. We will start with the earliest stage of development. Nothing. I will now try a stage three embryo. There it is! Ah. Try another. Based on this data, I can calculate how many in this tree are altered. I can't believe it. They all have one. Don't move. Why are you doing this? I know what you've done. What is it that you think I have done? How do you explain this? That is a structural inhibitor chip, which is supposed to prevent you from being aggressive, like your source, Jango Fett. Jedi Master Syfo-Dias instructed us to implant them during your growth cycle. The Jedi? The Jedi had this done to us? It is not uncommon to have inhibitors placed in a clone. I have analyzed this one, and apparently it has failed. Up until this point, there has never been a problem. Well, you have got a big problem now. Don't move! Drop your weapon. Master Jedi, I know what's going on. I have the evidence. The Jedi instructed that inhibitor chips be implanted in us at birth, but Tup's malfunctioned. That's what made him lose control. Where is the evidence? I have it right here. As you can see, the chip taken from clone trooper Tup is black and rotting, indicating a malfunction of some sort. What caused the malfunction? It doesn't matter. The fact is, Tup's chip malfunctioned, and it drove him insane. These chips have to be removed, otherwise the entire Republic Army could be compromised. There is no proof of that. This is an isolated incident. Besides, when you removed trooper Tup's chip, he died. Well, that's not going to happen to the rest of us. And how do you know that? Because I removed mine. Here is clone trooper Fives' chip. As you can see, there is no sign of malfunction in either him or the chip. By removing your chip, you are a threat. Master Jedi, we must terminate this trooper immediately. I am not a piece of hardware! I'm a living being! You were created in our laboratories. You are Kaminoan property! Correction: technically, he is property of the Republic. That does not change the fact that he is a danger and must be terminated. I believe that's for me to decide. Fives, you are coming with me to Coruscant. I think it's time you told your story to the Chancellor. Master Jedi, I beg you to reconsider! The Chancellor wanted all the data on Tup to be sent to Coruscant. We're sending the data, the tumor, and Fives along with it. Then I am going with you. As you wish, Doctor. Thank you for believing in me, General. It is not a matter of belief, Fives. It is simply the right thing to do. It looks like you got what you wanted. Thanks to you. I'll see you on the other side. The other side of what? Ah, droids.   \n                "}, "Cloak of Darkness": {"episode": "s01e09", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe.Clone.Wars. Seasone 1 Episode 9 Viceroy Gunray captured! Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala has scored a victory against the Separatist alliance on the remote world of Rodia, securing the arrest of diabolical confederate leader Nute Gunray. The Jedi council has dispatched Master Luminara Unduli and Anakin Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka to escort the Viceroy to Coruscant under heavy guard. Once there, he will face trial for his many war crimes. Captain, have you made contact with the cruiser? Yes, General. We'll patch you through now. Jedi cruiser Tranquility, this is General Luminara Unduli requesting permission to land. You are clear, General. - We await your prisoner's arrival. - Thank you, Captain Argyus. I look forward to delivering him to you. I am a man of great wealth, and I can be very generous to my allies. That is a very tempting offer, Viceroy. In the meantime, I have a gift for you. Finally. It's been such a boring trip. This is an outrageous miscarriage of justice. - I demand my litigator. - Keep moving. Greetings, General. We have the brig all ready for this traitor. Very good, Captain. Commander Gree, let's get under way. Right away, sir. Let's move. Senate commandos? How does a money-grubbing worm like Gunray rate all this security? He doesn't look that dangerous. Don't let your overconfidence give Gunray another advantage, Ahsoka. Even now, his allies may be conspiring against us. Gunray's capture could be a serious threat to us, my friend. The Viceroy will not last long under Jedi interrogation. I have already put a plan into action, My Lord. My best agent, Asajj Ventress, will infiltrate the Jedi ship and either free Gunray or silence him. Ventress? You are putting a great deal of faith in an operative who has failed us in the past. She is a gifted Assassin. You have my word she will complete her mission to the letter. Very well. You may proceed. Master. There is no margin for error this time, child. You must prove yourself worthy of being my apprentice. I am worthy, as you shall see. How goes the interrogation? - Has the Viceroy cracked? - Not yet. Neimoidians are a slippery lot, but the Jedi will wear him down. Your thoughts betray you, Viceroy. I can sense your concern, the fear that you will lose the wealth and the power that the war has given you. I have no idea what you're talking about. You hide a great many things: the names of your secret allies, the locations of their bases. I am an innocent pawn in all of this. If you're merely a pawn, then who are you protecting? No one. I know nothing. Liar! Liar! I'm tired of all this whing. Tell us what we want to know right now, or I will gut you like a rokarian dirt fish. Padawan, terror is not a weapon the Jedi use. I wasn't serious. But the only way he'll talk is if he's scared enough. Perhaps I was too hasty. Let us negotiate. Captain, status report. Droid fighters incoming. They've brought boarding ships. Green company, prepare to repel the enemy. Green leader to Commander Gree, super battle droids have breached our hull. They're headed for the detention level. We need reinforcements. - Commander, I'll need your assistance. - Let's go. You will stay here with Captain Argyus. - Guard the Viceroy. - But As you wish, Master. It appears you are in no position to negotiate after all, Padawan. - Perhaps after my rescue - Rescue? Maybe they're here to make sure you won't talk. All units, there's a bomb Trooper, what have you found? Come in, trooper. Do you copy? Super battle droids are everywhere. Fall back to the detention level. We have to protect the prisoner. See anything? Engine room seems clear. - We'll lock it down. - Good, Captain. The enemy's advancing toward the prison level. We're on our way. You keep watch here, 327. Okay, 327T. You know droids never like to be called by their nicknames. There. Looks like the last of them, General. Yes, Commander, but I sense our troubles are not over. Sounds like your rescue didn't work out after all. I am ready to discuss our bargain again. Padawan Tano, may I have a word? Certainly, Captain. If I leave, you won't go anywhere, will you? I've got the all-clear. The enemy has been repelled. And their attempt to free Gunray has failed? If it isn't the hairless harpy. If it isn't Skywalker's filthy, obnoxious little pet. How nice of you. I'll tell you what. I'll give you a merciful death. The Padawan. Come on. Shoot her! Skywalker's not here to save you now. Good thing I don't need saving. Over here! Open this door, and I'll buy you a planet. Yes, yes, such delicious irony. How do you like your room now, youngling? Halt, assassin. Surrender. What are we waiting for? Thanks. Everything's running haywire: doors, lifts. Communication's down. Propulsion's dead. She's crippled the entire ship. Our attacker has come for Gunray. Stay here and guard him. I'll confront her myself. Master, all due respect, but Ventress is too powerful for any one Jedi to fight alone. Let me help you. I am more than capable of dealing with a lone Assassin armed with undisciplined fighting skills. - But - Stay here and keep a clear head. Luminara Unduli may be a Jedi Master, but she has no idea what that bog witch is capable of, no idea. I can't let her face that lowlife alone. Wouldn't we have a better chance of stopping her if I helped? Sometimes being a good soldier means doing what you think is right. That's why we're superior to droids. Do you think you'll still be able to call on the Force after I've separated your head from your body? Even with my vision clouded, I recognize the fighting style of Count Dooku. Your version is unrefined, amateurish, sloppy. I can't disobey a direct order and leave my post, - can I? - I wouldn't. Don't worry. We've got this under control, Master Jedi. Your friend won't be going anywhere. All I know is, I never risk my own skin if I don't have to. What? - Watch him closely. - You can trust us, Commander. Call us if you need help, sir. Now you fall, as all Jedi must. I know. I know. You told me to stay. Well, as long as you're here. We have to find her. We can't let her get to Gunray. What's that, Captain? Nothing to worry about. What are you doing? No, please don't. Do shut up. Count Dooku is paying me a fortune to deliver your slimyry carcass, so please, try to stay alive. What happened to Padawan Tano? This Assassin, I've never faced an adversary like her. I should have listened to your advice. Master, I never meant to overstep my bounds, but General Unduli, we've been betrayed. Argyus has freed Gunray. I've been a fool. Let's get back there. We'll take her together. Stop. This is your last warning. Don't shoot. I am an innocent pawn. He won't shoot. He doesn't want to damage his prize. - Stand down, Captain. - Come and get me. Why'd you do it, Argyus? A clone like you would never understand. I wanted a life with more than empty servitude. And for that, you'd betray the Republic? Like I told the Padawan, sometimes being a good soldier means doing what you think is right. You and I disagree on what makes a good sol You should have taken my offer when you had the chance, clone. The outer shields are still down. The ship is still in turmoil. We're home free. As successful a rescue as one could hope for, Viceroy. I will be a legend for this. I always had a good feeling about you, Captain. You see, Assassin? Our plan went off without a hitch. Our plan? And I will, of course, make sure your contributions are noted in my report to Count Dooku. I'll tell him myself. Greetings, Viceroy. I always had a good feeling about you, Assassin. I'm sorry that despicable wealth-worm Gunray got away. It's okay, snips. I know you did your best. Master, I Troubling is the treachery of the Senate guard Captain Argyus. Revealed all around us our enemies are. I'm not sure all is lost. Gunray and his accomplices stole a Republic ship to make their getaway. It could be tracked. - Indeed. - A coward Viceroy Gunray is, but powerful allies he has. Swiftly we must move if we are to recapture him. Master Fisto's fleet was near Gunray's position. I've already contacted him to follow the signal. Ahsoka, I'll meet you at the rendezvous point. Yes, Master. Master Luminara, I guess this is good-bye for now. I owe you my life, Ahsoka. Protecting a Jedi Master is the role of the Padawan. And teaching is usually the role of the Master. Master Skywalker should be proud. Farewell. Thank you, Master. Commander, let's get under way. Yes, General. Ahead full.   \n                "}, "Darkness on Umbara": {"episode": "s04e07", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tWar in the Expansion Region! As the Separatists tighten their grip over vital but isolated supply routes, the Republic launches a lightning strike into a remote, ghost nebula, to control the strategic system of Umbara. Republic forces smash through the Separatist blockade in an effort to claim the shadowy world. Masters Krell and Tiin will be supporting my troops in the south, while Anakin's battalion comes in from the north and takes out enemy reinforcements. It is imperative that we conquer the capital city as quickly as possible, and hold it. Our biggest problem is gonna be the local militia. The Umbarans have aligned themselves with the Separatists and are heavily armed. ARC Trooper Fives will be assisting my units on special assignment. Ready to do my part, General Skywalker. - Nice to have you on board. - Just like old times, Rex. Remember, Anakin, Cody and I will be We're counting on you to take out those local fighters, or, I'm afraid, the capital will never surrender. Does my battalion have to do everything? You seem to always volunteer. All right, let's go! There's a lot of surface fire. They ain't got nothing we can't handle, sir. - You hanging in there, Tup? - So far so good, Captain. General Skywalker, I've turned the lights out. Our night vision sensors are having a tough time in this chop. I hope we don't overshoot the landing site. Just get us as close as you can. Time to lock and load! - After them, boys! - All right! - Let's go! - Let's do it! Go, go! Go, go, go! Give it to them! Go, go, go! Take them out! Take them all out! That's the stuff! Incoming! That's it. Give it to them! Let's go, let's go! Go, go! Go, go, go! The planet has a ridge at 23 degrees, north-northwest. Good. We can use it as a staging area. That's it! Take them around the right. Keep moving. We've gotta claim that ridge. The other battalions are counting on us. Let's go! Don't stray too far. The enemy could have the whole place rigged with traps. I can't even see the enemy! That's why they're called the Shadow People, Tup. Everybody, take cover! Go, go, go! Look, it's just a vine. Keep moving, Hardcase. Yeah, I got it all under control. That's not right! Nice work, Fives. - Hardcase, right? - Yeah, that's what they call me. General Kenobi's battalion, sir? They're pushing towards the capital. We'll need to move out as soon as the men are ready. All platoons have reported in, General. - Get some rest. - Thank you, sir. I'm fine. The General's giving you an order, Dogma. Of course, sir! He's wound tight, but he's loyal. He kind of reminds me of you. Maybe, back in the day. - What is that? - Look out! Ambush! They're behind us! The enemy's circled behind us. Everybody, we must defend our backs! Call in an air strike on the enemy positions. Let's hope they're not too busy helping Obi-Wan. There's an opening to our south. I recommend we move all platoons off the ridge in case the air strike overshoots. Good thinking, Rex. Everyone, move out, now! All here, sir. Stay covered. We have to hold the position. Are you sure those bombers are coming? Good old Odd Ball. Always on target. - Glad we got off that ridge. - Yeah. That'll teach them. General Krell's here? Something big must be going on. Master Krell, my thanks for the air support. Indeed, General Skywalker. The locals have proven to be more resourceful than we anticipated. But that's not the reason for your visit? No. The Council has ordered you back to Coruscant, effective immediately. What? Why? I'm afraid a request was made by the Supreme Chancellor, and the Council obliged. That is all they would tell me. Well, I can't just leave my men. I'll be taking over in the interim. Don't worry about a thing, sir. We'll have this city under Republic control by the time you're back. Master Krell, this is Rex, my first in command. You won't find a finer and more loyal trooper anywhere. Good to hear that. I wish you well, Skywalker. Your reputation precedes you, General. It is an honor to be serving you. I find it very interesting, Captain, that you are able to recognize the value of honor, for a clone. Stand at attention when I address you. Your flattery is duly noted, but it will not be rewarded. There's a reason my command is so effective, and it's because I do things by the book, and that includes protocol. Have all platoons ready to move out immediately. That is all. Quicken that pace, battalion. This isn't some training course on Kamino. The new general has a way with words. He's just trying to keep us on schedule. By raising everyone's ire? Either way, he's in charge, and we've got a job to do. Just treat him with respect, and we'll all get along fine. Do you see that? Yeah. Ready your weapons. Anyone else wanna stop and play with the animals? Didn't think so. Now keep moving! Sir, we've been keeping this pace for 12 hours now. The men are getting worn down. We should rest. General Krell, the top of this ridge will make a good place for the men to make camp. The men don't need rest. They need the resolve to complete the task at hand. - But, sir - CT-7567, are you reading me? Excuse me, sir? I asked you a question, CT-7567. Do you understand the need to adhere to my strategy? Sir, the terrain is extremely hostile. Despite the difficulty of the conditions, the battalion is making good time. - These men just need a little break. - Captain, do I need to remind you of this battalion's strategic mission in conquering this planet? Look back. See those platoons? Their mission is to take this city and take it swiftly. Time and rest are luxuries the Republic cannot afford. We are the key to this invasion. The other battalions are counting on our support. If we fail, everyone fails! Do you understand this? Do all of you understand this? Now, move on! Sir, we're ready to bring our forward platoons in for a surgical strike on the city's defenses. - There won't be any need, Captain. - Sir? All platoons will execute a forward assault along the main route to the city. But, sir, General Skywalker's plan was to surprise them with multiple attacks. If we come in from the main route, they're likely to engage us in a full frontal assault. Change of plans, Captain. I'm in command now. With all due respect, General, we don't know what we are up against. It might be wiser to think first. Are you questioning my order? This battalion will take the main road straight to the capital. You will not stop, and you will not turn back, regardless of the resistance you meet. We will attack them with all our troops, not some sneak attack with a few men. That is my order. And you will follow it explicitly. Do I make myself clear, CT-7567? Yes, General. Now, engage! So, why aren't we sticking to the original plan, and probing the city defenses first? We can do this. Let's take them. Yeah, leave it to Hardcase to dive in head first. The General's new plan is reckless. You ever think that maybe the General knows what he is doing? I know you think this is a bad idea. I raised my objection to General Krell's plan, but he didn't agree. So, this is it. What if he's wrong? Then what? This isn't the time for a debate. Right now, we have to stay alert. Eh, it's too quiet out there. Mines! Nobody move! Oz is down. So is Ringo. Can you sweep them? There are more over here. Looks like the whole road's been booby trapped. Everyone, watch your step. We're completely exposed. Hold your ground! You want a piece of this? Uh-oh. I think Hardcase made them mad. We're blown! The Umbarans are advancing. Make them eat heat. They're coming from all directions! We don't have any cover! We need to pull back. Get them to follow us. If we can draw them out, we can see them. If we can see them, we can hit them. All squads, pull back now! This can't be good. Feeble minded clones! Get in there and save their necks. Get ready. Here they come! Stand back. Hit them with everything you got. Where are you going? Get back here! They're pulling back. CT-7567. Do you have a malfunction in your design? You've pulled your forces back from taking the capital city. The enemy now has control of this route. This entire operation has been compromised, because of your failure. General Krell, in case you haven't noticed, Captain Rex just saved this platoon. Surely you won't fail to recognize that. ARC-5555, stand down. Sir. Yes, sir. Sir, if I may address your accusation, I followed your orders. Even in the face of a plan, that was, in my opinion, severely flawed. A plan that cost us men. Not clones! Men! As sure as it is my duty to remain loyal to your command, I also have another duty. To protect those men. You have a spark of tenacity, Captain. I'll give you that. I know that I don't command like the Jedi you're used to serving, certainly not like General Skywalker, but I have my way. It may be difficult, but these are difficult times. And it's proven effective. And I suppose your loyalty to your men is to be commended. They seem to admire this. That's important to an effective commander. All right, Captain Rex, your opinion has been noted. Dismissed. I think he almost complimented you. It's hard to tell. Incoming! Get back! Get back! The Umbarans must have regrouped for a counterattack. Everyone, we must hold this position! You think General Krell still intends on taking the capital using this strategy? I don't know. I'll get back to you on that if we survive this battle.   \n                "}, "The Zillo Beast Strikes Back": {"episode": "s02e19", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA calculated risk. Following a costly victory on the planet Malastare, Chancellor palpatine orders Jedi knights mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker to transport a fearsome Zillo beast captured during the battle back to Coruscant. After seeing that not even a lightsaber could harm the beast, Chancellor palpatine hopes to unlock the secret of its invulnerability to create new armor for the Republic's clone troopers. Tensions run high as the most dangerous life-form in the galaxy touches down on the Republic's most populous planet. Let's go! Move it! Move it! Come on! Come on! I can see him! Stand your ground. Watch it. Watch it. You are clear. You are clear. Copy that. No, no, don't stop. Yes, sir. Your excellency. Such size. Such power. With respect, Chancellor, I believe this creature could pose any number of dangers. Bringing it here to Coruscant is a mistake. Oh, I assure you, I did not make this decision lightly, master Jedi. The sooner we unlock the Zillo beast's secrets, the sooner we can end this terrible war. I hope you're right, Chancellor. I'm turning the Zillo beast over to you, doctor. I trust it will be given good care. The beast is a priceless resource, master Windu. It will be well treated, I assure you. Why would the Chancellor want to bring the beast here? I know that he thinks, by studying it, the knowledge could prove beneficial, but from what you and Anakin reported on Malastare it hardly seems worth the effort. I raised the issue with the Chancellor during the battle of Malastare, without succes. Well, then in that case, perhaps it's time we let someone else try. That's enough. Its scales are remarkably strong and light. If we could examine their composition, we might be able to synthesize them to reinforce our clone armor. And what is stopping you? We need to remove the scales first. It's very difficult, not to mention painful. Would it not be more efficient to simply kill the beast? Kill it? Are you sure? Chancellor, I must protest. Besides being the last of its kind, this creature may be intelligent. I find that hard to believe. It is, after all, just an animal. It didn't seem to like your comment. I applaud your high moral stance, doctor. After all, principle is in short supply these days. However, every passing minute of warfare brings countless deaths, deaths that could be prevented once the beast's secrets are unlocked. If there is any way to hasten that process, it is our moral duty to explore it. I serve at your pleasure, Chancellor. I'm just not sure where to begin. The fact remains that the beast is indestructible. Nothing is truly indestructible, doctor. Wasn't there something in Malastare fuel that affected the beast? It weakened the Zillo, yes, but Excellent. I suggest you start there. Doctor, you need to find a way to kill that beast, or we shall replace you with someone who can. Oh, hello. You're not in trouble again, are you? I am not being rude. Not that it isn't a pleasure, senator, but I thought I was just meeting Obi-Wan here. Master Kenobi explained the problem. I'm here to help. Problem? What problem? The situation with our friend from Malastare. Uh-huh. I see what's going on here. You think I could help influence the Chancellor. The Zillo beast was chained up and brought here against its will. It has no voice to defend itself. Anakin, we have to be that voice. You haven't seen it in action. You have no idea what it's capable of. It's what we're capable of that frightens me. A creature's life, maybe even an entire species, is at stake. Doesn't that at least warrant a discussion? I didn't think you'd feel so strongly about it. All right, let's speak to the Chancellor. But I still don't like this. I should have known secrets do not stay secret for long around here. Isn't that precisely the point of a democracy? Of course, in wartime, some things must be kept secret, even from the people, so as not to aid the enemy. It is unfortunate that the beast must die, senator. But the greater good demands it. How is killing the last of a species, in secret and without debate, good for anyone? Don't you have more pressing issues that require your attention today? No, Mr. speaker, I do not. I sympathize, my dear. Truly, I do. But consider this. A democracy is only as strong as the people who comprise it. At present, the people I am charged with protecting are dying faster than I can count. It is my moral imperative to take action. Anakin, is it not worth the life of one savage beast to give our brave troops the advantage they need to win this war? My role is not to set policy, Chancellor, but I do see both points of view. I'm certain a reasonable solution will present itself. Master Kenobi has taught you well. Chancellor. Excuse me. You are supposed to be helping. Whose side are you on, anyway? Yours, but You must admit the Chancellor makes some good points. Ah, Dr. Boll. I trust you have some progress to report. Yes, Chancellor. I was able to convert the Malastare fuel toxin into a poison gas. I believe it's now strong enough to kill the Zillo beast, if that's still how you wish to proceed. I wish I saw an alternative. However, sadly, I must ask you to proceed with your assignment. I'm sorry. Don't worry. It will all be over soon. Begin procedure. Vital signs are dropping. No, it should have been enough. I don't like the sound of that. If that creature is as powerful as they say, what good are these rifles going to be? Ah, shut up, Kosmos. Take it down. Take it down! Man down! You in the black, let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Everyone, back! Oh, no. Doctor, were you successful? We have a problem, sir. We need time to convert Malastare fuel into more toxin, Chancellor. I suggest you hurry, doctor. Evacuate the staff to the underground shelters. Stay with general Kenobi. I'm on my way. Better hurry, sir. You're missing all the fun. I have no doubt the Jedi To be sure of safety Ah! But I will not stand It's coming this way. Perhaps now would be a good time to evacuate to the lower levels. Yes, we are going now. Desperately needed the tanks are. We're almost at the loading dock, master yoda. Dire the situation has become. Before more lives are lost, act quickly we must. My security staff insisted on adding this emergency escape route. Chancellor, I think we may have enough toxin now. My guards will be with you shortly. Hand the gas over to them immediately. Does it have to be destroyed? The Jedi stun cannons will not eliminate the problem. Our advanced technology simply cannot contain it. I wish we had never brought the beast here. Pardon me, mistress Padme, but I believe something is following us. Evasive action. We're doomed! All tanks acquire solution and prepare to fire on my order. Hold your fire. In the beast's clutches the Chancellor is. Anakin might be with him and senator Amidala. If the beast falls, at risk their lives shall be. I've got an idea, but it's risky. Considering the circumstances, I'll take the risk. I've got a bad feeling about this. Sir, looks like the general's up to something. What is Skywalker doing? It appears to be one of Anakin's improvised plans. How can it be a plan if it's improvised? Not to worry. Just catch them when they fall. A lot of the general's plans involve falling. Distract the beast we shall to give Skywalker more time. I hope you know what you're doing. Here's where the fun begins. Hang on! Catch it! Ani! Ooh! All pilots, fire. Sir, we have to get you out of here. Artoo, get over there! He can't carry both of us. You go, sir. Ah! Oh, no! We aren't having much of an effect. Time to leave it is. Ooh! Oh, no! Let's go. Use the gas bombs. Copy that. Bombs away. It's a tragedy that the Zillo beast paid with its life for our mistakes. I will make certain that sacrifice was not made in vain. Doctor, a word, if you please. Your new orders. What is this? You want me to clone the beast?   \n                "}, "The Gathering": {"episode": "s05e06", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tAs the Clone War scorches its destructive path across the galaxy, it is the Jedi who bring order to the chaos. Though as the war progresses, the number of Jedi have declined, and new younglings are harder to find. When a youngling is located, they are brought to the Jedi Temple and learn quickly that their true family is now the Jedi Order. The trials are hard. Tests must be passed. But none is as important as The Gathering. It is then that a Jedi's path will truly begin. Hurry, younglings. You have proved to be the top of your class. And so now is the time of The Gathering. For a Jedi, there is no greater challenge or honor. What is The Gathering, Padawan Tano? Petro, Ganodi, Byph, Katooni, Zatt, and Gungi, the time has come for you to build your own lightsabers. I knew it. That's so wizard. Whoa! I knew it. Be warned: this is no simple task, and many perils lie ahead of you. Where we are going, there is no place more sacred to the Jedi. Not the most hospitable place. I think that's the point. It's a dead end. Younglings, outstretch your hands and focus the Force. Together, and only together, can we enter. Now hurry. The sun has already risen, and we must begin. Master Yoda. The Force made physical, a Jedi is. Comes great responsibility with that, yes? Protect others, how does a Jedi, hmm? Build your own lightsaber, you shall. But first, harvest your crystal, each one of you must. - See, I told you. - Yoda, wow. - No, I told you. - No, I told you. The heart of the lightsaber, the crystal is. Focuses the Force from the Jedi, it does. If Jedi you are to become, enter the crystal cave, you must. Trust yourself, trust each other, and succeed, you will. Once you have found your crystal, do not remain inside. As daylight ends, the door will freeze over again, and you will be trapped. For how long? For one rotation. There will be nothing anyone can do for you. How will we know which crystal to pick? Only you can know which one is yours. Now, hurry. How do they expect us to find our crystals when the whole place is made up of ice? I don't see the big deal, though. I could easily last a night in here. From my calculations, taking into account the planetary movements in this system, um the sun only rises on Ilum every 19 days. That's a very long night. Well, I don't know about you lot, but enough with the chatter. I'm gonna be the first to get my crystal and get out of here. Petro, wait. Maybe we should stay together. No, thank you. You're on your own. Come on. We need to keep moving. You're right. He is selfish. Ugh! Which way now? We don't have much time, and we have no idea where the crystals are. We need to break into groups. What? No. Are we Jedi or cowards? On the count of three, close your eyes and point to a door, and that's the direction each of us will go. One, two, three. Uh, sorry, Byph. Looks like you're on your own. Byph, your instincts told you to go that way. You have to follow your instincts. You shouldn't be afraid of monsters, Byph. You're a Jedi. That must be a crystal. I don't think this is the right way. We'd better go back. Wait. Up there! Look! Something's flashing. I can't see anything. Why can't you see it? Maybe because it's your crystal. They said only we would know. You'll have to climb. But up there? It's it's just so high. I can't do that. I believe in you. What if I get up there and there's nothing? Well, that's a risk you'll have to take. Hey, you're lucky. I haven't even seen anything resembling my crystal yet. Good luck. A whistling? I can't hear anything. You think it's your crystal? Gungi, no. You'll never make it. You'll freeze to death if you fall in. You need to be patient. See how the sun is setting and moving away from the lake? Just like the door we came through, it's freezing over again. Once the water freezes over, you will have very little time to get your crystal and get out. Now excuse me. I have a crystal to find. And I'm running out of time. Good luck, Gungi. This whole thing is ridiculous. I don't even think there are any crystals. You hear me? You just have us walking in circles until we freeze to death! I'm never gonna find a crystal, never! Whoa! Now what? Looks like I'm the first back with my crystal. That wasn't so hard. And the others? Who knows? I didn't want to gloat, since I found mine so quickly. Show us. A crystal you have found. Water you have brought. But that's impossible. It was my crystal. I was sure of it. Mm. So certain were you. Go back, and closer you must look. But the door is already half closed. Then you better hurry. Oh! You can do this, Katooni. You can do it. That's impossible. It's saying there's crystals everywhere, but I can't see anything. Where? Which way? Ah! You're useless! Stupid, useless, dumb thing. You can't even find a simple small crystal. There's so many. How am I supposed to know which one is mine? It's hopeless, hopeless. Well, that's going to take too long. I I'm not afraid. I can do this. I'm a Jedi. I'm one with the Force, and the Force will guide me. I'm running out of time. Where is it? Come on, Zatt. You're gonna have to trust yourself instead of relying on technology. You can do it. I can feel it. It's close. I can sense it. I can sense it. That must be it. Ah! Oh, great. Oh, no. It's a dead end. Is anyone there? Can you hear me? Great. I have my crystal, but I'll never get out of this place. Well done, Gungi. But two still remain. Ugh! I'm running in circles. Petro! Petro! Katooni? Petro! I'm trapped. Can you help me get out? I I can't. I still haven't found my crystal. Petro, you can't leave me. I I have to go. Petro, no! Petro! Petro! Will they make it, Master? We should help them. Left the cave, you have. Help them, you will not. Come on! Katooni. Katooni! Petro? Petro! There's no time. Put your hand on the ice. Together, we can break it. I knew you'd come back. Come on! The doors are closing. Petro? Go ahead. I think I see something. But it's too late. Trust me. Go. I have my crystal, but Petro is still inside. Give up on your friend, do not. Petro! You made it. How did he break the ice? Only water made solid was the door. Easy to break if you have the will. You-you said we would be trapped. Not by the cave you were but by your mind. Lessons, you have learned. Find courage, you did - Hope, patience Trust, confidence, and selflessness. Yes? Take your crystals back to the temple and keep them safe, young Jedi. - Yes! - So exciting. - Yay! - All right!   \n                "}, "Ambush": {"episode": "s01e01", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tGreat leaders inspire greatness in others. A galaxy, divided by war. Peaceful worlds must choose sides or face the threat of invasion. Republican Seperatist armies vie for the allegiance of neutral planets Desparate to build a Republic supply base in the system of Toydaria, Jedi Master Yoda travels to secret negotiations on a remote neutral moon We are getting no signal from the republic your heighness. I don't see anything. It is not like the Jedi to be late. Greetings, King Katuunko. - Who are you? - I am only a messenger majesty. My master wishes to speak with you. Katuunko, Great king of Toydaria, forgive my intrusion. Count Dooku. I am aware Master Yoda hopes you will allow the Jedi to build a Republic base in your system. in exchange for protection, correct? Your spies serve you well, Count. I ask, How can the Jedi protect you, if they cannot protect themselves? Toydarian Royal Delegation, this is the Republican envoy, please respond. General, the Toydarians beacon is active on the moon, but all our transmissions are being jammed. We caught them by surprise alright! We're losing our shields. Too late it is, sprung is the trap. - I must get you to safety General. - Retreat you must, on the moon below, is my mission. There, I must go. I suppose you and your droid armies can do better? Without a doubt. I sense you are one who respects strength, your heighness. Our droid armies outnumber the Republic clones 100 to 1. Perhaps, But I have heard, That a single Jedi equals 100 battle droids. Quickly now, Reach the planets surface we must. In an escape pod sir? The enemy will fire at anything we launch. Then launch all of them, you will. Master Yoda's powers have been greatly exaggerated. That remains to be seen Count. Indeed But when you decide to join us, my apprentice will contact me. Hang on, almost What a terrible shot. Ah well, It's my programming. That was a close one. General, I think we're out of range. I agree, But, entering another trap we are. Are you sure? A disturbance in the force, there is. My Lord, Master Yoda's warship has fled the system. What further evidence do you require of the Jedi's weakness? This is King Katuunko. Speak. Master Yoda would like to talk with you sir. A pleasure it is, to hear your voice, your heighness. Master Yoda, of the Jedi Council this is. Master Jedi, I though perhaps Count Dooku had, frightened you off. Delayed have I been, but not too far away am I now. Unaware I was, Count Dooku was invited to our meeting. The Count invited himself. He assures me that in this time of war, his droids can offer me greater security than your Jedi. hmmm, a matter of debate that is. Your Majesty might prefer more than words. What do you have in mind? If Yoda is indeed the Jedi warrior you believe he is, let him prove it. Allow me to send my best troops to capture him. If he escapes, join the Republic. But should my droids defeat Yoda, consider an alliance with the Seperatists. I did not request Yoda's presence here to test him in battle. Accept the challenge I do, your heighness. Arrive by nightfall, I will. Master Yoda must be given a fair fight. My dear King Katuunko, I would have it no other way. Beautiful this moon is. Amazing the universe is. There's gotta be a full battalion in there. Probably packin' armor too. We'll have somethin' for 'em. I'm deploying my forces, master. Yoda has made a grave mistake, straying this far from Coruscant. I will see the Jedi gets his \"fair\" fight. Carry only what you need, slow you down it will. Destroy Ventress, your weapons will not. Come lieutenant. Hurry we must. Sir, the rendezvous point is that way. As is our enemy. To reach our goal, a straight path we will not follow. Let's move it boys. Find Master Yoda. Ahh, what does he look like? He'll be the small shriveled green one, with the light saber. Small huh? Don't worry Supreme Leader, we'll take care of him. I think I see them. They're hiding deep in the trees. Fire on Sector 11. At ease be, my friends, within range we are not. Hold it, Hold it. I said hold it! That's far enough! I mean it! Stop I said Stop! - We're too big to fit in there. - No we're not, watch this. - You were right. - Next time listen to orders. Those tanks are too big to follow. See, see? Size is not everything. Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind. Do you have any idea what the General was talkin' about? How should I know? There's no figurin' a Jedi Master. Infantry, advance. Go get 'em boys. Sir, there are two patrols coming in on foot. Now is the time to face the enemy lieutenant. Ambush them we will. We'll flank them from the South. Right, let's move. What was that? Blast him! Look, little green life form. You bucket head, that's the Jedi! He is a little one. Blast him! Split up by squad and spread out. roger roger, roger roger OK clankers, SUCK LASER! - Where's the General? - I don't know, we got separated. Clankers! Fall back, there'r too many of them. He's around here somewhere. Hey, get off of me! Don't move. The Jedi destroyed our advance troops. Master Yoda is living up to my expectations. Commander, have you pinpointed the Jedi's location? Affirmative. The clones gave away their position. Our heavy troops are moving to engage them now. I hope the General reaches the rendezvous point. This should buy him time. - Lieutenant, can you walk? - I think I'm okay. Die Republic dog! What are we gonna do sir? - What's the General doing? - Keep blasting! Hey, what's going on? Get out of the way, all of you! I'm having a serious malfunction! Don't shoot! I'm on your side! - You found us just in time sir. - Left behind, no one will be. Rollers, inbound. Retreat! Cover you, I will. Republic troops are injured, the Jedi is in full retreat Supreme Leader. Good. Pursue them without delay. The contest is not over yet. Master Yoda, I hear you're having trouble with the droid army? Trouble? I know nothing of this trouble. Look forward to our meeting soon I do. The Jedi won't allude me for long. Are you sure we should go in there General? There's no way out. Now rest, we must. We're low on ammo sir. Only 2 grenades, and 1 rocket for the launcher. Against a battalion? Forget it, we've lost. So certain of defeat, are you? With respect General, maybe you should go on. Let us slow 'em down. All around us, is that with which we need to prevail is. Come, sit. Your helmets, remove them. Your faces I wish to see. There's not much to look at here sir. We all share the same face. Deceive you, eyes can. In the force, very different each one of you are. Rys, always focuse on the enemy, are you. For inspiration, look to yourself, and those beside you. Jeck, concerned about weapons you are. Weapons do not win battles. Your mind, powerful it is. Outthink the droids, you can. Thire, rush not into fights, Long is the war, Only by surviving it, will you prevail. Yes. Clones you may be, but the force resides in all life forms. Use it you can, to quiet your mind. Tanks. - Is that the best they can throw at us? - Yeah, but I've only got one shot left. - Greet them I will. - General, you don't plan to take that whole column by yourself? Have you three I do. Outnumbered are they. Know the time to help me, you will. It's the Jedi! Block his escape! Prepare to fire! Supreme Leader, we found the Jedi. Excellent. Where is he? He's just sitting here, in front of our tanks. Shoot him, shoot him now! Quickly! Ready, Aim, Fire! Fire! He's gone under the tank! Oh no! Run for it! But, I, just, got promoted. Doesn't look like the General needs help to me. We've got him in our sights. That's a lot of smoke, for a surrender. Report. What's going on over there? Where is 224? Destroyed, Supreme Leader. The Jedi has overrun our position and I think perhaps all those stories about the Jedi are true. The fight isn't over yet, Majesty. The General's cutting 'em up. We've got trouble. Clankers sent reenforcements. General's too busy with that tank, he won't see 'em coming. I think I know how to deal with them. Yeah! Great shot sir! That's givin' it to the clankers. Learned something today, have you lieutenant? I think we all did General. Come, behind schedule are we. Not polite to be late. You were right, Dooku. One Jedi is not worth 100 battle droids. More like, 1,000. I'm sorry, but I will be joining the Republic. I urge you to reconsider wise king. I promise you won't regret it. Your agent also promised me Yoda would get a fair fight. I will not deal with those who break their words. So be it. Perhaps our negotiations will be more fruitful with your successor. Ventress, kill him! Jedi Master Yoda. I am very pleased to meet you, at last. Share the feeling, I do, King Katoonku. Failed you, Ventress has. Count. I don't fear you Jedi. Strong you are with the dark side young one. but not that strong. Still much to learn you have. Surrendur, you should. In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side. It's a pity I wasn't there in person, my old master. A pity, indeed, my fallen apprentice. Perhaps now, begin negotiations we can. That is not necessary, my friend. You have my faith. Toydaria would be honored to host a Republic base. My people, are at your service. Your Majesty, fail you, we will not.   \n                "}, "A Test of Strength": {"episode": "s05e07", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tAncient Jedi tradition! Six younglings are sent to the secret caverns of Ilum, where they are tested by The Gathering, an ancient Jedi ritual where each youngling must harvest a crystal, around which they will construct their own lightsaber. Along the journey, they underwent great perils, hardest of which was to face themselves. Now, having passed the test, they take their first step into a larger world. I call that move the \"Whirlwind of Destiny.\" Showoff. Can everyone gather around, please? You have all successfully passed The Gathering and harvested your crystals. So when do we start to build our sabers? Place your crystals on the table. Your lesson begins now. May I introduce you to architect and lightsaber designer Huyang? These are them. I swear they get younger every expedition. All have passed The Gathering? Yes, sir. Are you sure? But he's a droid. You expect us to learn from a droid? Who said that? Many years I have been on this ship, teaching many a Jedi before you, and I will continue teaching many a Jedi after you. Call me what you want, but inside my memory banks, I contain a record of every lightsaber ever made and the Jedi who fashioned them. Whoa! Look at that! Which will you choose? A simple grip? The curved approach? One inlaid with the bone of the Cartusion whale, pastillion ore, or black onk? Well? From Battles of Rashfond to the Peacekeeping of Parliock to our very own Clone Wars, the lightsaber is a Jedi's only true ally. But how do they work, hmm? Yes, you have brought me crystals, but they're all useless unless you give them life. Do you know how to awaken the Force within the crystal? No? Then I suggest you listen and learn until you think of a question this droid cannot answer. A Wookiee. Rare you are to the Jedi. Proud your people must be. Unique, just as your lightsaber will be. Hold out your hand, Wookiee. Describe what you see your saber to be. No, no, no, not what you imagine but what you feel in your hand. Concentrate. What will make you strong in battle and humble in retreat? What connects with your Force? Ah, yes, wood. Not a common choice. And only wood from the brylark tree is as strong as metal. Let me see. Where would we find that all the way out here, far from anywhere, deep in space? Let's see what we have. Let me see. Let me Yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ah, I wondered where I put that. Oh, that's not mine. Ah, ah, what do we have here? - Whoa, look at that. - Ooh. - Ooh. - Wow. You can say that again. Wow. It is my job, before you leave this ship, you will have everything you need to build your lightsabers and the knowledge of how to do it. So let us begin. There is much more work to be done. Well, where are they? The Jedi ship is right in front of us, sir. Lose them, and you'll lose more than your head. Our attack must be swift and devastating. They cannot have time to get away. I thought we weren't going to mess with Jedi anymore. These aren't Jedi. My sources say they're just younglings, headed back to the Jedi Temple from a training mission with the most important treasure in the universe-- Kiber crystals, used for making laser swords. The price for just one would make a man rich, and we all know how much I like to be rich, don't we? What's the rush, Petro? With this lightsaber, I'm going to challenge Obi-Wan Kenobi to a duel and kill Grievous. The only person you are going to kill with that, my young friend, is yourself. You have inverted the emitter matrix, which will cause the power grid to backfire. Light this, and all that will be left of you and your lightsaber will be your crystal. Start again, and this time, please follow the diagram. Remember, quiet your mind and concentrate. The design will become clear. Good. Gently. Trust the Force. What was that? I don't know. Hold on. Artoo, what's happened? Where? Oh, no. Ugh, they're aiming for the hyperdrive. Get us out of here! I don't like the sound of that. Stay here. I'll check on the younglings. Excellent shot. Fire the grappling harpoons. Now reel them in, and let's get what we came for. What's happening? We're being boarded. Here? Why? I don't know. Quickly, give me your crystals, and I will hold on to them until we are safe. Younglings! Younglings! Who's attacking the ship? Pirates. Pirates? They'll kill us all. Perhaps we should hide in the ventilation shaft. Follow me. Hiding is for cowards. We should stand and fight. Huh, we're gonna fight, just not the way they expect. Time to go. Is this part of our training? It is now. Shh. Hondo says find the kids and bring 'em to him. Dead or alive? Yes. We must have courage, young Jedi. Ganodi and Zatt, I need you to get to the cockpit, find Artoo, and secure it. The rest of you, take Professor Huyang and seal yourselves inside the hold, and wait for my command. What are you going to do? I'm going to reroute enough power to the engines so that we can break free of the pirate ship's hold on us. Okay? Wh--what about the pirates already on board the ship? Once the docking tube is ruptured, when the ships pull apart, a vacuum will be created, which will suck the pirates off our ship and into space. Will we be sucked into space? No, the cockpit and the hold will be sealed and still have air. Do not--and I mean do not-- engage the pirates. Your only job is to stay hidden. Do you understand? Now go. I smell profit! Nice, juicy, fat, warm profits. Well? We've secured the ship, but she seems deserted. Imbecile! That is the oldest trick in the book. The runts are probably hiding in the ventilation system. Oh. Right. Didn't think of that. Why does that not surprise me? All that matters is you find the younglings and bring me the crystals. If anything gets in the way, kill it. But, boss, they're just kids. They're just kids. When will they learn? In case you lack motivation, remember that on the black market, these crystals are priceless. We can't fit in there. Smoke them out. You heard the boss. I do love me a party. Hold it! Get off him! Easy, there. That's no way to make friends, now, is it? Thanks, buddy. Come on, keep up. The hold is not much further. Something's wrong. Unhand me, brigand! Well, hello, girls and boys. We've been looking forward to meetin' ya. Now, be nice, and hand over your crystals. Over my dead body. That can be arranged. Petro, no. Your emitter matrix is still inverted. So which one of you is first? All bark, no bite. Ah, that's for me. I always wanted one of these. You sure you can handle it? Huh? Everybody get down! Let's go. Hurry, hurry. This way, younglings. You could have killed him. Look, we can keep running, or we can stand and fight and show these pirates we're not afraid. I cannot approve of such action. Besides, I have been damaged and cannot aid you in battle. Petro's right. It's our only choice: fight or be killed. Zatt, come in. I am overriding the emergency power fail-safe and routing energy to the engines. It's working. Any word from the others? Have they reached the hold? - Uh, not yet. - Where are they? I don't know. I didn't hear from them. Great. I know what that means. Set them to the highest level. Get him! Gungi! Here, kiddie kiddies. You can come out now. No one's gonna hurt you. Zatt, close the door to the training room. Katooni, where are you guys? No time to explain. Just close the door. Artoo, close the door! Hey, what's--what's going on? We can't make it. There are too many blocking the hold. Well, children, you have put up quite a fight, but playtime is over. Now, hand over my crystals, and no one gets hurtmuch. Hondo, the Jedi Council will not take kindly to this attack. Ahsoka, how will they know who is responsible if there is no one left to tell the tale? You seem less hospitable than our last meeting. My mood is based on profit, and today I am in the mood for crystals. You want the crystals? Come and get 'em. Oh, easy, now. Hurry, hurry. What about Ahsoka? Trust her. Now, get in there. Oh! How dare you? I've lived on this ship a thousand years and never lost a fight. I'm not about to start today. You know, had I known you were here, I would have simply asked for the crystals directly, and we could have avoided all of this. I don't want to hurt you, Hondo. I know, and I appreciate that. We're all in the hold, but Ahsoka's still out there fighting the pirates. Ahsoka, Ahsoka, come in. They've made it to the hold. Then what are you waiting for? But what about you? Do it! What are you doing? Getting you off my ship. Oh! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, ah! Whoa! We're all clear. Make the jump to hyperspace. Ah, ah, ah! Yes! We did it! They're off the ship. Oh, Professor. Bring him here. I'll fix him. You should have seen Ahsoka. She took them on all by herself. Where is Padawan Tano? Padawan Tano, come in. Ahsoka. Ahsoka! Ahsoka, are you there? You have cost me greatly today, young one. And since you lost me so much profit, I am left with no choice But to turn you into profit. Good night.   \n                "}, "To Catch a Jedi": {"episode": "s05e19", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tAhsoka Tano on the run! After an attack on the Jedi Temple, Anakin Skywalker's young Padawan found herself accused of murdering the person responsible for the bombings. With no choice but to run, she was chased by her master, who begged her to turn herself in. Knowing there is little hope of being cleared of the crimes, Ahsoka decided to find out the truth and prove her innocence on her own. After further investigation, there can be little doubt that the clone officers murdered in the escape were killed by none other than Ahsoka Tano herself. She used a Jedi mind trick to convince the clone to open the door and then proceeded to cut him down along with five other clones along the way. I do not believe that Ahsoka could have fallen so far. The beliefs of the Jedi Council are irrelevant. We deal strictly in facts and evidence, and the evidence points to Padawan Tano being guilty of the attack on the temple and the murder of the Republic officers. This is sedition. Skywalker, was there no way to stop your Padawan before she escaped? No, Master Mundi. The Council believes that Ahsoka may be guilty of the crime, still believe they are wrong, do you, hmm? I believe she didn't kill the clone troopers or the woman who used the nano-droids to blow up the temple. That's why she's running. To prove her innocence. Now she's in the lower depths. With her skills, she will be hard to find. Two teams we will send. Master Skywalker and Master Plo Koon, with clones you will go. I think it would be best if Skywalker stayed here. Having you involved may actually make things worse. Master Windu, with all due respect, she is my Padawan. The reason for you not to go. I think we're being foolish if we take Anakin off this mission. Who knows her better? He's emotionally tied to her. Probably too emotional to do what needs to be done. I'd rather capture Ahsoka and find out the truth then let her run because of a lie. You must prove to us that you will stay focused. Can you? I've already alerted security on the lower levels to be on the lookout for Ahsoka. Go swiftly then, Skywalker, and bring back this lost child before it is too late. Yes, Master. This one just came in. Looks like the Jedi are after one of their own. She's armed and dangerous. Alert all units. You heard him. Barriss, it's Ahsoka. Ahsoka, I'm so glad you're safe. - Safe but on the run. - Where? I can't tell you, but someone is definitely trying to frame me. It's not safe for you to call me using the Jedi communicator. Find another way to contact me. I will. In the meantime, I'll do some digging and see if I can find anything out to help you on my end. Thank you, Barriss. Be safe. Hey, buddy, are you hungry? Yeah. Let's make a trade. What do you want? Your cloak. Passes, please. Passes, please. Passes, please. That's her. The rogue Jedi. All units respond. We have located the rogue Jedi. - Uh. - Whoa. - Ah! - Oh. Get out of the way. Look out! Stop her! I've got her. Ah! Ugh. - Look out. - Ah. - Whoa. - Ah! Dupa-la zuga lu! Sir, look! Stop! Not good. Don't worry, little guy, I'll get us out of this. I'll--I'll think of something. Maybe I can cut a hole in the roof. Ya kumay na. Ya kumay na. Almost there. Kumay na. Almost got it. Kumay na. Kumay na. Kumay na. Huh. I, uh, guess I'm not exactly on my game these days. Thanks, kid. I owe you one. The lower level police claim to have spotted Commander Tano heading to level 1312. All right, let's bring her home. Uh! Well, well, I didn't believe it when I first heard it, but I guess it's true, the Senate has put a bounty on your horned little head. And I'm going to be the one who collects. Ventress, it was you, wasn't it? You were behind all of this, and you framed me! I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do! So what are you now, a bounty hunter? Yes, and someone who knows how to make easy money. You think you're just gonna hand me over? And then what? Get a pat on the shoulder? You're Separatist war criminal and a Sith. They'll have us both in prison before you said your name. I don't have to hand you over to the Jedi. I can hand you over to the bondsman and still get paid. I'm gonna get my money whether you're dead or alive. Heh, good luck. Despite what you hear, I'm still a Jedi. I'm afraid the other Jedi no longer see it that way. I hate to admit it, but you're right. That's why I'm going to need your help. In what star system do you think I would ever help you? A traitorous Jedi tried to blow up the Jedi Temple and has framed me for that and other killings. Mmm, so the Jedi aren't that holy after all. I know Dooku tried to have you killed. I know he betrayed you. What if this is his new apprentice? I've fallen from my path just as you've fallen from yours. We have a lot more in common than you think. What can you offer me that's better than money? If you help me, I'll speak to the Council and the Senate on your behalf. I'll get you a full pardon for your crimes. You have my attention. But I'm going to go where the tide flows. If the tide is flowing against you, don't think I'll forget about the bounty on your head. Fair enough. I suggest we find somewhere else to discuss this. Shine the light over there. Stay where you are! Ventress. Send out the probes. I want them found now! Nice place you have here. Not everyone on Coruscant lives in a luxurious temple on the surface. I guess I'll have to get used to that. Just make the call. Adding another criminal act to your record? I don't want them to be able to trace it. Barriss, it's me. It's so good to see you, Ahsoka. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, if you consider Anakin and a hundred clones on my tail a good space to be in. You were almost captured? Once or twice, yeah. Where are you? I can't say, Barriss. I believe I've found a clue. A clue? How? From where? We don't have much time, Ahsoka. Fine, I'm on level 1312. A holo-booth at the corner of 12th and G. Got it. Three levels up there seems to be an abandoned warehouse where they used to build munitions that Letta visited during the time she was getting access to the nano-droids. How did you find this out? I told you I would do some checking. Ah, thank you, Barriss. Be careful, Ahsoka. Well? I think I have a lead. It doesn't seem like you need my help. That's not true. We need to find an abandoned munitions warehouse on level 1315. We should be able to find some information there. You know the place I'm talking about, don't you? Yes. I can get you there. Listen to me. I don't want to fight. I do. We're taking you in now, Commander. That's not gonna happen, trust me. Now I'm not going to hurt any of you-- we're not going to hurt any of you-- but you're not taking me in. Commander, we are taking you in. Let's play. Take 'em out. Ah! Take her out. Take her out. Ventress, don't. Look out! Ugh! They'll cut us down! Oh! Watch it! Take a shot. Too fast. Arg. Ah, oh. See? Didn't kill one. It's the new me. General Plo Koon, we had Commander Tano, but she escaped with the help of Asajj Ventress. There it is. That's where you're supposed to find this clue. I've done my part of the bargain, which means you're on your own from here. But don't forget, you have to speak on my behalf now. That was the deal. Agreed. Thanks for getting this far, at least. I have to admit, I never saw us doing anything together ever. These are strange times. I thought we decided we were going to part ways. Ugh, ah! Ah! How am I supposed to find a clue when I don't even know what I'm looking for? Uh! Ventress! I see you've had a change of heart. Why bring me here? Answer me, Ventress. Why? Ah! Calling all units. Suspicious activity on level 1315. Ugh. Nano-droids? No, Wolffe, let me explain. Explosives. These are the same types of nano-droids that were used to blow up the Jedi Temple. I can't believe it. Captured she has been? Yes, Master Yoda. Without incident? No, she was subdued by the clones and found in possession of explosive nano-droids. It still doesn't explain Ventress' involvement. We saw her with Ahsoka. I think there's more going on than we know. By Ahsoka or against her? That remains to be seen. We're bringing her back to the temple. Let's just hope we can keep her here.   \n                "}, "Senate Spy": {"episode": "s02e04", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tTreachery in the Senate. The Jedi council suspects that Senator Rush Clovis is secretly taking part in a separatist conspiracy. But to find out what the Senator from Scipio is up to, the council will need a spy of its own. Meanwhile, Jedi Anakin Skywalker has been away from Coruscant on a lengthy tour of duty leading the clone army. Now Anakin returns for a long-awaited reunion with his wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. Master Ani. What a delight to see you. I shall tell mistress That will be all, Threepio. Are you sure, my lady? Now go. Very well. I brought dinner. How did you manage this? I had to hitch a ride on a cargo freighter. What happened to your military transport? It blew up. Anyway, the captain was bringing a shipment to a restaurant here, and he gave me something to bring home. We just have to - What? - You called this \"home.\" What else would I call it? The Naboo ambassador gave me something. I think I still have it here somewhere. - Must be something good. - It is. It'll be perfect. Five blossom bread, my specialty. You have a specialty? I know how to make lots of things. When I was little, I cooked every day. I've been saving it for a special occasion. An evening alone with you? I can't think of an occasion more special. Involved with the Separatists, the Banking Clan is. Discover the truth in this matter, we must. I couldn't agree more, Master Yoda. But if Senator Amidala has already refused to spy on Senator Clovis of the banking delegation, I am not sure how we can change her mind. That is why we asked you to summon young Skywalker. I have been signaling him all night. I don't know where he could be. I wish it could always be just like this. Me too. I have to report to the Jedi Council. Right now? Actually, about seven clicks ago. If I keep delaying, Obi-Wan will send a clone squad out to find me. I've been ducking his signals all night. I understand. I can sense that you're angry. Don't think you can read my mind. You shouldn't take this personally. Duty comes first, especially in wartime. Sorry I'm late. What's going on? We believe Senator Clovis is conspiring with the Separatists. We need to find out what he's planning. Do you want me to interrogate him? Treat Senator Clovis as a criminal, we should not. The slightest misstep could cause a major incident. You feel if we provoke him, we'll never find out what he's up to. Exactly. We need someone who's not a Jedi to get close to him for us, someone he won't suspect. - If not a Jedi, who? - A fellow Senator. Selected Senator Amidala, we have. You want her to spy on Clovis? I don't think that's a good idea. There has to be someone else who's more qualified for this. We chose Senator Amidala because she and Clovis entered the Senate in the same year. They served on the same committees. They were good friends. I didn't know that. Personal matters for the Senator, these are. Know them, why would you? It's just that I wouldn't expect Senator Amidala to have a friend in the Banking Clan. Master Yoda has already asked her to spy on Clovis for us. And she refused. Trust you, she does, Skywalker. That is why, convince her, you must. Senator Amidala. General Skywalker. You finally found some time for me. - Are you still mad about last night? - Why would I be mad? - I'm not mad. - Good. Now tell me about your dealings with Senator Clovis. So you're here on Jedi business. I already told Master Yoda. I don't want to spy on a colleague and an old friend. \"Old friend.\" How well do you know Clovis? Why does that matter? That was before we were together. I am just trying to get a sense of who this guy is. I'll need to brief whoever does end up spying on him. I thought you were here to talk me into becoming an agent for the Jedi. That is not a job for you. I don't agree with the council on this. If Clovis is involved in a separatist conspiracy the last place you should be is anywhere near him. Clovis is conspiring with the Separatists? Yoda didn't tell me that. I can't believe Clovis would do that. This is terrible. I never expected that from him. - Someone has to find out the truth. - Someone does. Just not you. - Why not me? - Because it's going to be dangerous. Whoever takes this mission will be putting their life at risk. I've been in many tough situations before. It never seemed to bother you. I never stopped you from facing danger. - You're constantly getting shot at. - I've been trained for that. It's very different from spying on a traitor. You mean I can't handle the mission. - I mean I'm not gonna let you do it. - You're not going to let me? It's not your decision to make. It's mine. Lucky for us, you've already decided to refuse. Actually, I just changed my mind. You've convinced me that it's vital to learn what Clovis is doing. I accept the mission to spy on him. - Even though I'm telling you not to? - Don't take it personally, Anakin. Duty comes first, especially in wartime. First, I'll need to get back in touch with him. Clovis and I haven't spoken in a long time. A surprise that is, given your past. - What does that mean, Senator? - At one point, Clovis and I were close. It was my choice to return things to a strictly professional level. Clovis didn't take it well. Do you think you'll be able to rekindle your friendship with him? Master, Senator Clovis is a very dangerous man. - If he realizes she's tricking him - I'm aware of the risks, Master Jedi. But I know I can regain Clovis' trust. Good. The closer you can get to him, the better. I understand. I'll do whatever is necessary to succeed in my mission. And I'll do whatever I have to to protect her. It's been good to see you again, Clovis. I didn't realize how lonely I was until tonight. Perhaps I can do more to ease your loneliness once I return from Cato Neimoidia. You're taking a pleasure trip? Hardly. Going there to put the fear of Scipio in those overgrown Trade Federation grubs. You know how they are. They love to borrow money from the Banking Clan. But they hate to pay it back. Maybe you can say a few words on my behalf. I'm on the holonet with the Neimoidians every day asking for trade concessions, but I can't ever seem to make progress. I've got an idea. Come with me to Cato Neimoidia. Speak to them in person. I have leverage from the Banking Clan. You have diplomatic contacts. We can help each other. Are you inviting me for political reasons or because you want us to be friends again? Both, of course. Although I'm far more interested in your friendship than your politics. In that case, I'll be happy to go with you. It'll be like old times. On the contrary. I hope it'll be much better than old times. You look exquisite. If you get tired, you can rest your head on my shoulder. Allow me, my lady. And this one's broken. Too bad. We're ready for takeoff, captain. All I have to do is fly the ship. Blast it. Senator Amidala, an unexpected privilege. Senator Dod, please forgive me for arriving unannounced. Always a pleasure to see you, my dear. I hope you and I can make a fresh start. I came here with the very same hope. I believe in second chances. So do I, Senator. So do I. My servants will see you to your room. Clovis and I have some business to discuss. I hope you will be comfortable here. This investment by the Banking Clan will create unimaginable new war profits, the largest droid factory ever built. As long as the Republic doesn't find out. You should never have brought a member of the Senate here. After that long trip, I think I need a walk. That could prove interesting. I agree, Lord Poggle. For all the risks we're taking, we should be getting a greater share of the profits. Are you suggesting we change the terms of our agreement? A deal is a deal. I'd hate for something to happen to you. You forget yourself, Clovis. You cannot threaten me on my own planet. This is hardly your planet anymore, not since you signed your holdings over to the Banking Clan in return for a stake in this new droid foundry. We have company. The hologram. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm sorry to intrude. I was lonely, so I came looking for you, and My dear, I'll give you a proper tour later. Now let me take you back to your room so you can get dressed for dinner. Now, if you'll excuse me. I'll see you at dinner. How do you think I feel? I hate the thought of answering to Clovis. But perhaps we won't have to now that we've finally found his weakness. What if we were to poison Senator Amidala? I think Clovis would do anything to save her. And only we would have the antidote. No, thanks, R2. I'm not hungry. As soon as Senator Amidala finds something, she's gonna signal me to come inside. Senator, as my honored guest, please share this drink with me. A toast to our new friendship. Of course. Come, Senator. Everyone is eager to meet you. What a wonderfull meal. My compliments to the droid. Are you feeling all right? I'm fine. - I stood up too fast. - It has been a very long day. Perhaps we should retire to the guest quarters? Unless you'd like a tour of the palace. It's truly worth seeing. A tour sounds perfect. You're dismissed for the night. Are you absolutely sure? I'm sure. Well, really. My service is not required for the rest of the evening. Why isn't Padm\u00e9 with you? She is with Senator Clovis. He offered her a private tour of the palace. And you let her go off with him? I did try to warn her. I'm waiting for my business venture to start. I'm doing some private investing with guaranteed returns. Could you bring me something to drink? I'm so thirsty all of a sudden, and my head is pounding. You poor thing. It's the climate change. I'll be right back. Display hologram. Pass code required. Scipio. Banking Clan. Senator Clovis. Baron Rush Clovis. Rush. Padm\u00e9? Pass code accepted. Tactical coordinates for Count Dooku's new droid foundry. And Clovis and the Banking Clan are behind it. The Jedi Council has to see this evidence. Finally. Got to go. Seems no one wants my company tonight. Still dying of thirst? That tastes so good. I guess I was just thirsty. Come, Padm\u00e9. Give me your hand. You're so good to me, Clovis. I don't deserve your kindness. It's nice to hear you say that. I've been waiting for this moment all night. Your heart is racing. Because of you. I wasn't sure you still had feelings for me. But now I would have said something earlier, but we were in the middle of our official duties, and duty comes first, no matter No matter how we feel. Padm\u00e9, what's wrong? Take good care of this, Artoo. Get the ship ready for takeoff. Stay with her. I'll go get a medical droid. An excellent idea. I'm afraid this situation is quite beyond my capacity. If I'm not here in five minutes, leave without me. No matter what happens, the Council has to see this hologram. I know her symptoms. She's been poisoned. - What do you mean? - She could die. Get ahold of yourself, Senator. She is a Republic spy. What? Pass code \"Padm\u00e9.\" No hologram is available. She did steal it. Leave us. I was just in the library. The hologram disk is gone. I see now why you renewed our friendship, so you could spy on me and steal from me. I did it for the Republic. I didn't want to believe that you were involved with the Separatists. But you are. You're a traitor. Where is the disk you stole? It's on its way to the senate. Your scheme is finished. Get away from her, if you want to live. Padm\u00e9. How dare you speak like that to me? I'm a Senator. What's wrong with her? Lott Dod poisoned her. She's dying. I'll take her to the doctors on Coruscant. There's not enough time for that. Lott Dod must have an antidote. She's stolen a very valuable disk from me. Return it, and I'll get the antidote from Lott Dod. I'd prefer to negotiate with Lott Dod in person. - He cannot be told - What? That you lost the disk? I'm sure he'd be very interested in hearing all about this. He might kill me if he finds out. But still, it's her life that I worry about. She must be saved, because I love her. In that case, I suggest you can help us back to the Senator's ship before Lott Dod finds anything out. Come with me, quickly. We must make haste. What is going on, Clovis? I'm sorry, Lott. Senator Amidala is very ill, and we're taking her to her ship. If Senator Amidala is ill, she should not be moved. I have contacted the authorities on Naboo. They thought it best to take her back to Coruscant. The doctors there are better equipped. You cannot leave. Give me the antidote, or you're dead. You'll pay for this. Give Clovis the antidote. Your kindness is much appreciated, Senator. Take her, quickly. Have you lost your mind? Wait. Now give me back my disk. Don't worry, Clovis. It's good to know you have a heart. I wish I could give you the disk, but I have a lot of faith in your survival skills. Where's that medicine, Threepio? I'm sorry. What for? We got away, and we have the hologram. The Jedi will use that information to destroy Count Dooku's foundry. Your mission was a success. But I made you doubt me. Never. Clovis, we need to talk. May The Team Be With You   \n                "}, "Storm Over Ryloth": {"episode": "s01e19", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tStar.Wars.The.Clone.Wars.S01E19 Planet Ryloth invaded! Subjected to a brutal droid occupation, the people of Ryloth are starving under the blockade of a Separatists' fleet. Evil Separatist leader Wat Tambor now rules with an iron fist. Answering a pleas from the Senate, the Grand Army of the Republic mounts a bold offensive to liberate the system. It is up to Anakin Skywalker and his padawan Ahsoka to make way for Obi-Wan's ground assault. Captain, are you prepared? Our blockade is impenetrable. When the Republic attacks, they will get quite a surprise. I'm counting on you, Captain. We cannot allow the Republic to invade this planet. All ships prepare for launch. This is my first time commanding a squadron R7, let's make a good impression. OK, are you boys ready? This is Two Ax. Ready when you are, skipper. Ready on three. This is Slava. Over. Ready on four. Kicked back, checking in. Soup to Blue leader. Group Two is standing by. Over. Taco on five. Waiting for mother bird. Over. Launch all fighters. Roger. Roger. - Tell Ahsoka the fleet is ready. - Commander, you're all clear. Thank you, Admiral. Here we go. - Clear! - I'm on it. - Nice work! - Two new targets closing! That is General Skywalker's flagship. He is leading this attack. - Sir, their fighters are closing fast. - Patience. Let's see what trickery the Jedi have planned for us. We've got their fighters occupied. Ax, time for us to make a run for the battleship. Come on you whiners, let's get dirty! Sir, a squadron of fighters are attacking. They have a clear path right to us. Now is the time to bring in our reinforcements. Battlecruiser 17, Battlecruiser 19, attack position! Admiral, four more enemy cruisers have joined the blockade. We've got to warn those fighters. Commander, we've been caught in a trap! You're overreacting, Admiral. I can get us through. Blue Squadron, stay the course. We're all set, Blue Leader. I'm ordering you to return to the ship. We're going to need your help. Ahsoka, it's too risky. Get your pilots out of there. Sir, we've got their fighters surrounded. Good. She's not turning around. Ax, are you still there? Got two on my tail. I can't shake 'em! I can't help you, Ax, I've got my own problem. - They're breaking our lines! - Ahsoka, we are in trouble. I order you back here. Alright, alright. Let's go squad. Pull back to the command ship. - Why are we retreating? - We're not, we're following orders. Intensify deflector shields. There's too many. We can't shoot them all! Fighter squadron, where are you? - We're almost there. - It's too late! Run for it! Admiral, come in. Admiral! - Hang on, Admiral. - Get us out of here! Get those fighters onboard and prepare for lightspeed. All fighters return! We're preparing for lightspeed. Right. Ax, stand on it! We only have a few seconds to get onboard. Don't worry about me, skipper. Captain, the Republic space forces are in retreat. Shall we pursue? No. Do not break our formation. Let those cowards run. My power converters, they're failing! Just stay with me, Ax. Overload! Close up the hangar doors, we're home. Jump to lightspeed. Get your squad together. I need a head count. I need to know how many we lost today. Ahsoka, I am very disappointed in you. You not only disobeyed the Admiral, you disobeyed me. I thought I could knock out those ships soMaster Obi-Wan could get through. I know you meant well, Snips, but there's a bigger picture you're not aware of. First rule of war, listen and obey your superiors. But sometimes you get carried away. All that means is I understand what you're going through. - But I failed. - It was a trap, Snips. It wasn't your fault. I lost so many of my pilots. Take heart, little one. That's the reality of command. General, we're approaching our staging area. Very good, Captain. Master Windu requests a report on our progress. Our progress? - We haven't made any progress yet. - I'll tell him, sir. No, Rex. I'll tell him myself, thank you. As soon as we tend to our wounded. Get me a damage report. Right away, sir. Snips, I'm gonna need you to Captain, what is the status of the enemy attack? The Jedi were crushed, of course. They fled the system, their ships in flames. I assure you our blockade is very much intact. Congratulations are in order, Captain. But do not underestimate the Jedi. Commander, bring me the archive data on General Skywalker. I need to learn more about our opponent. Roger, roger. They caught us by surprise, Master. - We were outnumbered. - How many men did you lose? We lost a cruiser, the Redeemer, plus an entire squadron of fighters. And your Padawan? No, Ahsoka is fine. She's just recovering from the battle. Losing her squadron was hard to take. Give her time, but, Anakin, you will need her help if you're to get through this. I know. Your forces have been cut in half, Skywalker. If you can't break that blockade before the next planetary rotation, we'll have to postpone the invasion. The Twi'leks can't wait for ever, Master. The longer the Techno Union keeps control of Ryloth, the more difficult it'll be to free them. I agree. We don't have much time. Rex, see if you can find Ahsoka. He is stable for now. Admiral, I am so sorry. They're all gone. Commander Ahsoka, General Skywalker is looking for you. No, R2, the other one. That's it. This'll do it. You wanted to see me, Master. Ahsoka! Hand me that socket plug. Here. Thanks, Snips. How are you feeling? Oh, I'm fine, Master. Just fine. That's good to hear. I'll need you levelled-headed if we're gonna pull this off. Pull this off? Pull what off? I talked to Master Windu. We're to proceed with our attack on the blockade. What?! We can't! We have to break that blockade. The Twi'leks are depending on us. I understand that, Master, but we've lost so many men. - Did we get more support? - No. We have to make do with the forces we have. - And I need to come up with a plan. - You don't even have a plan?! Don't worry, Ahsoka. That's what you said last time and now everyone's gone! My whole squadron! We can't just smash through that blockade. Skywalker here. The Defender is contacting us, there seems to be a problem. Alright, Rex, I'll be right there. Go back to your quarters and cool off! We'll finish this talk later. Not a conventional Jedi to say the least it would seem. - Commander! - Yes, Captain? Prepare all cannons and send the droids to their battle stations. Yes, sir. Captain, are we under attack? But if Skywalker's record indicates anything, he'll be back. Trooper, what's going on? The starship Defender is being evacuated. Evacuated?! Why? I'm not sure. We're on our way to help General Skywalker in the hangar. Alright, men, this way. Come on, move it. Move it! Let's go! No time to waste! Master, I'm almost afraid to ask. - I ordered the Defender evacuated. - I can see that. Why? Well, actually, I got the idea from you. Oh, great. Rex, take over will you. You said we couldn't smash through the blockade, I decided that's partly true. You implied my plans put a lot of people at risk - and I agree with you on that one. - That's a first. The only way we can break the blockade is if I pilot the Defender into their battleship and take out the commander. - What?! - This way I'm the only one at risk. Besides, the Defender is damaged already. You can't be serious, Master. - You'll die! - No, I won't. That's where you come in. The enemy can't stop that ship taking them out, R2 and I will jettison an escape pod right before impact. But the enemy fleet is right there! I know and I'll pretty much be defenceless in an escape pod, so I'm depending on you to engage the remaining fleet with our forces. Master, I I can't. If something goes wrong, I can't be responsible You are responsible. These men are depending on you and this time so am I. But, Master, last time I Attention! Everyone! Attention! Alright, men, listen up. I'm taking over the Defender and I'm leaving Ahsoka in charge. She'll lead the mission when we engage what remains of the blockade. Commander Ahsoka will fill you in on the full plan. - Master, wait! - Good luck. Master! Awaiting orders, Commander. I'll be on the bridge. Well, you heard her, boys, back to work! Come on! Move it! Move it! - Commander on deck. - At ease. General Skywalker is contacting you. Alright, Ahsoka, we're ready to get under way. Master, are you sure you won't reconsider this? This is the only way, trust me. Better fill us in, Commander. Right. Count Dooku has assured me the Republic forces are stretched thin in our sector. They should be unable to mount a counterattack. Any attempt to do so would be suicide. Still, I am certain this Skywalker will return. He's ultimate defeat shall be my greatest victory. You admire Skywalker? As a general, yes, his record shows he is a great warrior. And I want him to know it is I who has beaten him. I have to say this plan is questionable. Yeah, but with their general destroyed along with their battleship, the droid commanders will be in chaos. Only temporarily. And there's still General Skywalker to find in all that mess. I know. Our first attack had three fully armed cruisers and we failed. I wish General Skywalker had discussed this plan with us. The odds are very much against us. They always are. Yes, but normally we have General Skywalker to lead us and I meant no offence, Commander. None taken. Sir, an enemy ship is emerging from hyperspace. I knew he'd return. There is an incoming transmission, sir. Put it through. Greetings, Captain. I'm Anakin Skywalker, general of the Grand Army - I know who you are, Skywalker. My reputation precedes me, then. I've been ordered to surrender myself, the entire crew of this vessel and my ship in exchange for safe passage of food and medical supplies to the people of Ryloth. A noble gesture, Jedi. And your capture would make me the envy of the Separatist fleet. Sir, even if Skywalker is successful and destroys the battleship, how will we stand up to the combined firepower of the remaining frigates? I thought about that and, well, I have an idea. Go ahead, Commander. If we took the Resolute and angled her hull against the incoming frigates the bridge and hangar deck would be relatively safe from their attack. We could draw them in and then use the bombers to outflank them. The bombers would be too fast and they would be trapped. I'm not sure about this, Commander. I think If we were certain the shields would hold. Perhaps a different strategy. We need to take more time and plan. No! We don't have any more time! Master Skywalker needs me now! He needs us now. The Commander is right. I know this strategy is very bold, but these circumstances call for drastic measures. Then, the strategy will work, sir? Well, will it? Yes, it will. We have completed the scan of the enemy ship. And? The ship is heavily damaged. All power is diverted to the forward shields. There is only one life-form onboard. - What?! - The ship is heavily damaged. - All power is - No, you insolent scrub! Skywalker, what treachery is this? You have nothing to bargain with. In that case, I'll be going. You can still have my ship. There's a second Republic ship entering the system. She made it! Boost the engines and let's get outta here. When those two ships collide there'll be chaos. We need that time to get General Skywalker's pod into the tractor beam. Right, Commander. I'll man the fighter squadron. Wait for my signal to begin our attack. Yes, sir. All canons, fire! Fire! We can't stop it! - What should we do? - You stay here. I'll be back. That's great. See, I told you it would work. Approaching your position. Standby for retrieval. Right on time, Ahsoka. I don't think they're going to attack. - We'll have to retreat. - No! Wait! Remember, they are droids. They're just a little slow. They'll figure it out. I think the Captain left. - Who's in charge? - Not me. - What should we do? - Begin attack. The droids are attacking, sir. Commander, on your order. Commence flanking manoeuvre. OK, boys, here we go. Follow my lead. - We've been outflanked! - Affirmative! That-a girl, Ahsoka. Where is the Captain? What is going on?! He's in an escape pod. Idiots! The blockade has been broken! Where are those escape pods? Commander, the invasion fleet is coming out of hyperspace. Ahsoka, this is Obi-Wan, may we begin our landing? Yes, Master. You're cleared for ground assault. I won't even ask where the rest of Anakin's fleet is, or why he's in an escape pod. That's probably for the best. Rex, that reminds me, send a shuttle to pick up Master Skywalker. General, are you still there? Yep. I'm just sitting here watching the show.   \n                "}, "Carnage of Krell": {"episode": "s04e10", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tWhile fighting to control the darkened world of Umbara, Anakin Skywalker's battalion is temporarily placed under the command of Jedi General Pong Krell. As Krell's disastrous strategies result in increasing casualties, his men begin to turn against him. Captain Rex struggles to balance loyalty between his commander and his fellow men. Under his watch, Fives and Jesse disobey Krell's orders, resulting in their court-martial. General Krell, I respectfully request you reconsider court-martialing Fives and Jesse. The actions of ARC trooper were a clear act of treachery and disregard for my command. If punishment isn't swift, their defiance may inspire others to follow suit. Sir, the men are with you. It's just that some of them feel you're putting their lives in danger needlessly. All the more reason to send a clear message that I am in charge and insubordination will not be tolerated. The truth is, these clones have had a difficult time respecting my command since the beginning. I've seen it before. Some clones are just defective. They aren't able to succumb to authority. You're right, Captain. I don't think I can court-martial them. It will only be a waste of time and that's something we don't have. I'm afraid they'll need to be disposed of. Prepare a squad for execution. What? But, sir You heard me, Captain. Have it done immediately, or I'll do it myself. Fives, Jesse, I'm sorry. General Krell has ordered your execution immediately. What? But how? He can't do this! He has authority to render punishment during combat. I can understand a court-martial and locking us up in the brig, but executing us? I tried to convince him that it's my fault, but he wouldn't let me. Rex, you have to face it, he's been using you. He needs your loyalty to control the others. I won't let him get away with this. Don't beat yourself up about it. We made our choice. We knew what the price was. Speak for yourself. Still got your sense of humor, I see. - Yeah, who said I was joking? - Well I guess this is it. Line up the prisoners. Well, I've officially lost my sense of humor. Will the prisoners request to be blindfolded? I'll take that as a no. I hope you can live with yourself, Dogma. Ready weapons. Never thought we'd go out this way. Aim. Wait! This is wrong and we all know it! The general is making a mistake, and he needs to be called on it. No clone should have to go out this way! We're loyal soldiers! We follow orders, but we are not a bunch of unthinking droids! We are men! We must be trusted to make the right decisions! Especially when the orders we are given are wrong! Fire! What What happened? They're doing the right thing, Dogma. Because if this is how soldiers are rewarded for heroic actions, then one day, every man in this battalion may face a similar fate. - Take off their binders. - No! We have orders! We have to go through with this! Good luck finding anyone to do it. You wanted us, sir? I ordered those clones to be destroyed. You are making a mistake by crossing me, clone. It's Captain, sir. - General, there's an incoming transmission. - Put it through. General, the Umbarans have stepped up their offensive. We're holding them off, but their squadrons have ambushed one of our platoons, seizing weapons and uniforms. We believe they may be planning to launch a massive attack. Looks like you have your stay of execution for now. Lock the traitors in the brig, and prepare your platoons to move out immediately. We need to pre-empt the enemy by hitting them now with everything we've got. We're finally going to take the capital. And, Captain, make sure the troops are aware that the enemy may disguise themselves as clones to try to trick us. I will, sir. Stay alert. The enemy has our weapons and our armor, they may try to trick us with an ambush. Watch out, Dogma! I saw that thing attack Hardcase. It'll chew you up and spit you out. Here, watch. Ew! - Gross. - We're under attack! - Where's the enemy? - I don't know! I can't see anything. Get those mortars up here! Anyone have a visual? Negative. It's too dark. Wait! I see them! They're disguised as clones, all right. - Captain, where are you? - We're sustaining heavy casualties! What? Everyone, stop firing! We're shooting at our own men! They're not Umbarans! They're clones! Take off your helmets! Show them you're not the enemy. - They're clones! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Everyone, stop firing. Cease fire! They're not Umbarans. They're clones! What the Look! We're clones! We're all clones! What? This can't be happening. What have we done? I don't understand. Why did these troopers attack us? Captain, I've found their platoon leader. It's Waxer, he's still alive. Waxer. Tell me who gave you the orders to attack us. It It was General Krell. He sent us to these coordinates to stop the enemy. We thought they were wearing our armor, but it was You. We all know who's responsible for what happened out there. What we don't know, is why. Something has to be done. What I'm proposing is highly treasonous. If any man chooses to opt out, do it now. From this point forward, we are entering uncharted territory. My orders are, we arrest General Krell for treason against the Republic. General Krell, you are being relieved of duty. It's treason then. Surrender, General. - You're committing mutiny, Captain. - Explain your actions! My actions? For ordering your troops against one another. Oh, that. I'm surprised you were able to figure it out, for a clone. Surrender, General. You're outnumbered! You dare to attack a Jedi? I will not be undermined by creatures bred in some laboratory! Get him! Hold it right there! - Lower your weapon, Dogma! - I can't do that, sir. - That's an order! - It's my duty! You're all traitors! I used to believe that being a good soldier meant doing everything they told you. That's how they engineered us. But we're not droids. We're not programmed. You have to learn to make your own decisions. Dogma, don't do it. Take him to the brig. Troopers, don't let General Krell escape! Anybody got anything? Negative, Captain. We lost him. Wait! He's too powerful! Hurry! He's coming! You should have listened to the ARC trooper from the beginning, Captain. He was right. I was using you. - You've all been my pawns. - Get him! Captain Rex, this is Tup. If you can, force the General towards me! - What? Why? - Trust me, sir! Troopers, listen up! Circle around, lure him towards Tup. Hey, ugly, come and get me! I stunned him, sir. Nice work, Tup. Why, General? Why kill your own men? Because I can. Because you fell for it. Because you're inferior. But you're a Jedi! How could you? A Jedi? I'm no longer naive enough to be a Jedi. A new power is rising, I've foreseen it. The Jedi are going to lose this war, and the Republic will be ripped apart from the inside. In its place is going to rise a new order, and I will rule as part of it. You're a Separatist! I serve no one's side, only my own. And soon, my new master. You're an agent of Dooku. Not yet, but when I get out of here, I will be. After I've succeeded in driving the Republic from Umbara, the Count will reward my actions and make me his new apprentice. How could you do this? You had my trust! My loyalty! I followed all of your orders, and you made me kill my brothers. That's because you were the biggest fool of them all, Dogma. I counted on blind loyalty like yours to make my plan succeed. That will never happen. You're a traitor, General, and you'll be dealt with as one. You never learn, Captain. The Umbarans are going to retake this base. And when they do, I will be free. Captain, we've repaired the transmitter. It looks like it was sabotaged. We received a message from General Kenobi. His forces have captured the capital, but the remaining Umbarans are heading here! Get everyone on the perimeter! We need to prepare for a full-scale attack. Yes, sir! Krell sabotaged the transmitter. He's been against us from the beginning. If the Umbarans get to him, he'll turn over all our intel. The defense codes, everything. He'll strike a crippling blow to the Republic. Something has to be done. We can't risk the possibility that he might escape. As long as Krell's alive, he's a threat to every one of us. I agree. Turn around and step toward the wall. On your knees. You're in a position of power now. How does it feel? I said, on your knees. It feels good, doesn't it? But I can sense your fear. You're shaking, aren't you? What are you waiting for? The Umbarans are getting closer. I have to do this. You can't do it, can you? Eventually, you'll have to do the right thing I I had to. He betrayed us. General Kenobi's battalions have routed the last hold-outs of Umbarans, and we've secured all sectors. We did it. We took Umbara. What's the point of all this? I mean, why? I don't know, sir. I don't think anybody knows. But I do know that someday this war is gonna end. Then what? We're soldiers. What happens to us then?   \n                "}, "Voyage of Temptation": {"episode": "s02e13", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tMale narrator: A royal welcome! Sent to investigate Allegations that mandalore Was joining count dooku's Separatists, obi-wan kenobi was Reunited with an old friend, The duchess satine of Kalevala. While satine claimed Mandalore's intentions were To remain neutral during The war, an attack on the Capital city led obi-wan to the Discovery of a terrorist Organization known As death watch. Now the duchess travels to The senate so she can Plead her case against her Involvement in the war, as The jedi prepare a defense Against her opponents. You know your Marching orders. The safety of the duchess satine Is of the utmost importance. The death watch will stop at Nothing to assassinate her Before she pleads her case to The senate. The death watch may be Backed by the separatists, So stay sharp. Artoo? Use your scanners to Probe for any suspicious droid Activity. [r2-d2 beeps affirmatively] Anything else, sir? No, that will be all. [beeping] Yes? The duchess and her retinue Requests your presence. Very well. I sense some anxiety From you about the duchess. She couldn't be in safer hands. Yes, i know. Then why Never mind. It's all in the past. Oh, so you're close to her? I knew her. A long time ago. All secure here. Let's move on to the next Sector. Beep! [eerie whirring] War is intolerable! We have been deceived into Thinking that we must be A part of it. I say the moment we committed To fighting, we already lost. Excuse me, your grace, Are you suggesting we Oppose the war on Humanitarian grounds? I'm going to oppose it As an affront to life itself. As the designated regent Of 1,500 systems, I speak for thousands Of worlds that have urged me To allow them to stay Neutral in this war. And yet some might Argue that the strongest Defense is a swift and decisive Offense. You are quite the general Now, aren't you, master kenobi? Forgive me for interrupting, Your highness. I meant no disrespect. Really? Senators, i presume you are Acquainted with the collection Of half-truths and hyperbole Known as obi-wan kenobi? Your highness is too kind. You're right. i am. Allow me to introduce My fellow jedi Anakin skywalker. Your servant, my lady. I remember a time When jedi were not generals But peacekeepers. We are protectors, highness-- Yours, at the moment. We fight for peace. What an amusing Contradiction. What master skywalker Means is that we are acting At the behest of your highness To protect you from the death Watch and the separatists who Don't share your neutral Point of view. I asked for no such Thing. That may be so, but A majority of your court did. I do not remember you as one To hide behind excuses. I do not remember you as one To shrink from responsibilities. I am certain we all agree. Duchess satine and general Kenobi have a proven there are Two sides to every dilemma. Indeed. Now, in regard to the senate Vote, we think-- I think a multitude makes Discord, not good counsel. Right again, my lady. There may be two sides to Every dilemma, but the duchess Only favors hers. [r2-d2 chirping] I'll check out the south Quadrant. Careful over there. It's dark. Yeah, very funny, mixer. [r2-d2 chirps frantically] Stop messing around. That's not funny.

I think we could all use A little rest and refreshment. Hear, hear. Now let us put politics Aside until after dinner. [together] fine! Stand by for lightspeed. Engage. My side's secure. What have you got, redeye? Redeye, you copy? [eerie whirring] [screaming] You and satine Have a history. An extended mission When i was younger. Master qui-gon and i spent A year on mandalore protecting The duchess from insurgents who Had threatened her world. They sent bounty Hunters after us. We were always on the run, Living hand-to-mouth, never Sure what the next day would Bring. Sounds romantic. [eerie whirring] [r2-d2 beeps] A civil war killed most of Satine's people, hence her Aversion to violence. When she returned, she took Rebuilding her world alone. You didn't stay to help her? That would have Been problematic. My duty as a jedi Demanded i be elsewhere. Demanded? But it's obvious you had Feelings for her. Surely that would affect your Decision. Oh, it did. I live by the jedi code. Of course. As master yoda says, \"a jedi Must not form attachments.\" Yes. But he usually leaves out the Undercurrent of remorse. Beep! Yes, captain? General, something's wrong With skywalker's astromech. Scared him a real good, sir. I've also lost contact with Two of my men. I'm on my way down To assist you. I'll go, master. If there's something dangerous Down there, the clones and i Can handle it. Deep-fried nuna legs. Mmm, delicious. I beg your pardon, senators. Our men are investigating A situation below decks. I respectfully ask you to Wait here until it is settled. All right, men. What's the problem? I'm missing dinner. We're not sure yet, sir, But there's still no sign of Mixer and redeye. What's the matter, buddy? [r2-d2 beeps] I know. i know. But i'm here now. Use your scanners. See if something's out of place. Well, what've we here? Looks like the contents of This box are missing.

There's a large open Container, and the contents are Missing. And i still have two men Unaccounted for. That's not good. Keep things quiet. I'll stay with the senators. Got it.

[mother droid shrieks] [grunts] [blaster fires] [blaster firing] No, please, i beg you. [blaster fires] Monster! You're a horrid monster! Get used to it. Did you find them? No, but i've stationed Troopers at every escape pod. Merrik will try to signal His allies for help. We have to find him. This may not be the Time to ask, but were you and Satine, ever I don't see how That has any bearing on the Situation at hand. Death watch command. Tal merrik here. Senator merrik. Have you completed your mission? Yes, sir. I have the duchess, but i'll Need help getting her away. Very good. Reinforcements Are on their way. I'll take care of this, Obi-wan. You? Go find your girlfriend. Right. Uh, no, anakin, she's not My [blaster fire] [lightsaber igniting] Come in, kenobi. You're expected. Tal merrik, you are Under arrest. Release the duchess. I took the precaution Of wiring the ship's engines To explode. I press this remote, And we all die.

Obi-wan, it looks like I may never see you again. I don't know quite how to say This, but i've loved you From the moment you came to My aid all those years ago. I don't believe this. Satine, this is Hardly the time or place for All right. Had you said the word, I would have Left the jedi order. That is touching. Truly, it is. But it's making me sick, And we really must be going. You have the romantic Soul of a slug, merrik. Ow! And slugs are so often Trod upon. Interesting turnabout, But even if i do not Deliver the duchess alive To the separatists, i still win. The second i'm away, I'll hit the remote and blow the coronet to bits. I will not allow that. What will you do? If you shoot me, you prove Yourself a hypocrite to every Pacifist ideal you hold dear. And you, kenobi. You are no stranger to violence. You'd be hailed as a hero by Everyone on this ship Almost everyone. Come on, then. Who will strike first and Brand themselves A cold-blooded killer? Anakin What? He was going to blow up The ship. Obi-wan, i General skywalker, The last of the droids Have been defeated, sir. Very good, cody. I must get back to The business of diplomacy. As you say, duchess. Some other time. A job well done, Master jedi. Thank you, chancellor. Your excellency. How ironic to meet again, Only to find we're on Opposing sides. The needs of your people Are all that matter. They couldn't be in a better Hands with you to guide their Future. Kind words indeed from A mindful and committed jedi. And yet What?

The Jedi have lost all contact with the clone security force stationed on the bleak snow-covered planet of Orto-Plutonia. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, accompanied by dignitaries from the nearby moon of Pantora, are sent to investigate the disappearance of the clone troopers on the desolate and forbidding landscape. And this is the planet's tropical zone. It's not Tatooine, that's for sure. Captain Rex, have your men survey the area. Place as many sensor beacons as you can before dark. Right away, sir. Unload that gear! Let's move! Why would the Republic want an outpost way out here? The chairman of Orto-Plutonia requested it? Why? General Kenobi. Chairman Cho, Senator Chuchi. I suggest you wait here until we can secure the area. I respect your judgment, General Kenobi, but I will go where I choose. This is sovereign Pantora territory. I thought this planet was uninhabited, and therefore, it's not aligned. Our moon of Pantora is the only civilization in this system. I'm the one who asked the Senate to protect this planet. This wasteland belongs to us. With all due respect, Chairman, this is for the Senate to decide, not us. But the Jedi report to the Senate, which is Senator Chuchi of Pantora. Technically speaking, Master Jedi, the Chairman is correct. Since the planet is uninhabited, the moon of Pantora reserves the right to continue as its protectorate. Point taken, Senator. Anakin, stay here with the Senator and the droids while we secure the base. I don't get it. It must be Separatists. I am not sure. Might we go inside, Master Anakin? R2 would like to get out of the cold. We'll go inside as soon as Obi-Wan signals that it's safe. Do you think the Separatists're building a forward base to attack Pantora? I don't think we're dealing with Separatists. These computers haven't been touched. Sir, our scouts have spotted a droid base on the other side of the ice ridge. By the look of things, I'd say whoever attacked our base took out the droids also. Rex, help Anakin place the sensor beacons. - You four, come with me. - Yes, General. Let's go. Did you find anything? I found some large footprints. Have one of your men make a cast. - Sensors are in place. - I think I've found something. Blast it. 685 to command. There are too many of them! They've overrun the base. We need reinforcements! - What was that? - Whatever it was, it's a good warrior. The droid's log indicates they were investigating the southern canyon. Sounds like a good place to start. I want the weapon system back online and the shields operational. There's no telling what the Separatists have planned. Chairman, what makes you so certain the Separatists are behind this attack? Look around, Senator. Isn't this carnage proof enough? I know, but there are no dead droids here, no blast marks. The clones' injuries were not consistent with what So you're an expert on war now, are you, Senator? No, Chairman. - No, I only - Let me tell you something, Senator. I have led our people since before you were born. Ive seen 100 planets rise and fall through force of arms. If it's not the Separatists, it's a malevolentenemy nonetheless. And I will not let whoever it is jeopardize the security of the people of Pantora. But if the Jedi discover that the Separatists aren't behind this, then perhaps there is a peaceful resolution. Senator, I am willing to fight and die for my people. It's time to ask yourself if you are brave enough to do the same. There's some kind of reflection up there. Do you see it? Yep. Well, they know we're coming. Let's go. Steady, Anakin. They're only curious. Let's not provoke them as the droids and our troops must have done. Too bad we didn't bring 3PO along. How do you plan on communicating with these things? Patience. Maybe they're smarter than we are. Well, say something. Just shut up. We come to you in peace. We will not bring harm. Peace. Glad you made it back, sir. It's getting nasty out there. You don't know the half of it. What did you find? It seems we've stumbled onto an inhabited planet. Impossible. Our explorers have spent much time here over the long history of Pantora. No one lives here. They're trespassers. With respect, Chairman Cho, these creatures, the Talz, aren't advanced enough to master space travel. I think they may have been here longer than Pantora. Whoever they are, they belong to us. This whole system belongs to us. Your majesty, if there are life forms here, then the Senate must decide jurisdiction. They are savages. Look at what they've done. They've slaughtered your troops. They only want to be left alone. The droids attacked them, and I'm afraid our outpost got caught in the middle. They must be subdued. They're dangerous. Captain Rex, prepare your troops for battle. We promised their chief there would be no retaliation. We've arranged a meeting between their high council and you and the Senator. They want peace. We can't send troopers. They'll think we lied. These creatures are little more than animals. You can't lie to an animal. They can't be trusted. - But, your majesty - No! It is obvious these creatures are not covered by the convention of civilized systems. The Jedi Council has no say in the matter. If the Jedi are able to communicate with them, their status is in doubt. Do you stand against your chairman, Senator? Of course not, your majesty. If we're going to meet with Thi-Sen and his council at the arranged time, we'll have to leave now. The gunships can't take off in this storm. We don't have enough bikes for the entire platoon. Have the rest of the men stand by here. No matter what the chairman thinks, we're not going to war. Captain, put your men on that ice ridge. We will attack as soon as the savages arrive. - There will be no attack, chairman. - You will do as I command. This planet is under my jurisdiction. Nothing is under your control, Chairman. The Talz are already here. Their scouts have been following us for some time. It seems thi-sen doesn't trust you any more than you trust him. Rex, tell your men to stand down. Stay here and don't do anything to provoke them. Yes, sir. Your Highness. We have returned As promised. These savages have no rights here. Chieftain Thi-Sen welcomes you to his home and hopes you come in peace. He wishes to be good neighbors, but he does not wish you to remain on his planet. Listen, droid, translate everything I say and exactly as I say it. Would you like me to in this matter? Not on your life, Senator. There will be no diplomacy this time. Listen here, you savage, this world belongs to the moon of Pantora. And as the Supreme Chairman and exalted ruler of Pantora, you will not command me to leave this planet or do anything else. Your Majesty, we can't. Droid, tell him. Dear. I recommend a less confrontational discussion. The Talz are easily provoked. That didn't go over very well. Chairman, I promised the Talz that we would leave them in peace. This is now an internal affair of Pantora. The great Thi-Sen, son of suns, asks again that you leave or it will mean war. Then war it is. Troopers, mount up and follow me. What's up, general? You're gonna stay with the chairman until we can work things out. Protect him at all costs. Mount up! We're moving out! Senator, you know a preemptive strike is illegal. Isn't there anything you can do to stop him? I'm afraid not. He has proclaimed this conflict an internal affair. You could petition the Jedi council for an intervention. You mean, without his authorization? There must be someone on your moon who could approve it. The speaker of the assembly. He has the power. Let's get back to the base. The storm is letting up. Maybe we can get a transmission through. Here they are. Fire when you're in range. Sir, with all due respect, we're only here to protect you. - Ambush! - It's a trap. Kill them! We're surrounded. Defensive formation! Chairman, get down! We've got to hold out! Fall back! First squad, cover the retreat! Retreat? We can't retreat from these animals. Savages. The assembly has decided that the actions of Chairman Cho are out of order. Senator Chuchi, you're given the authority to negotiate a peaceful settlement between the sovereign planet of Pantora and the Talz. - It is decided then. - Pilot, let's get moving. Here they come! Senator, now that you have the authority, how do you plan on making peace with the Talz? Actually, Master Jedi, since you're far more experienced, I was hoping you could negotiate on Pantora's behalf. I'm afraid that's not possible, Senator. But I don't understand. The Jedi serve the Senate. - I must order you to - Senator, it is your people the Talz are at war with. If the violence is to stop, it is you who must represent your people. - Good to see you, sir. - You okay, Rex? - It's just a scratch. - What's going on? We're in quite a mess, sir. including the Chairman. Chairman, can you hear me? Senator, good. You much avenge me. As my final command as chairman of Pantora, I order you to destroy the Talz! I'm afraid I cannot do that, Chairman. The Pantoran assembly has called you out of order. I am to negotiate peace. No Impossible! Peace? Never! I died for our people. Senator, now is the time. Protocol droid, come with me. Yes, Master Ani. Droid, - translate for me. - Yes, Mistress. To die for one's people is a great sacrifice. To live for one's people, an even greater sacrifice. I choose to live for my people. What do you choose? He chooses to live as well. We will leave Orto-Plutonia under the watchful eyes of the Talz from this day forth and recognize your sovereignty as a free and equal people. - Well done, Senator. - Yes. Most impressive. Thank you, Master Jedi. Now that you have created peace between your people and the Talz, remember one crucial thing. Yes, Master Kenobi? Make it last, Senator. Make it last. And be an example to others so not only this war, but every war waged may come to an end as well. I will. I promise you. There's a treator in our midst. - Take a seat, gentlemen. - And it's one of my brothers. First, someone sent General Kenobi and Skywalker into a trap. Come and get me, boys. Move! Then, he blows up the hangar deck. It can only be one of my brothers. But who? And why? I'm gonna find out. - Stop! - Make him pay.   \n                "}, "Counter Attack": {"episode": "s03e19", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t Escape from a separatist prison! Carrying information about secret routes into the heart of the Republic and separatist homeworlds, jedi master Even Piell was captured and imprisoned in a fortress known as The Citadel. Leading an elite strike team, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker rescued master Piell and his officers. Now the jedi have split up to evade separatist forces as they attempt to escape The Citadel. Artoo, are you and your battle droids ready to go? All right, get the ship fired up. We'll meet you at the pipeline exit after you've picked up Obi-Wan, assuming he's still on schedule. This passage will get us near the landing pad. Artoo, send the shuttle to the rear landing platform. We've already been given the go-ahead by general Skywalker, sir, assuming you are still on schedule. The trick will be if Anakin arrives on time. A probe! Did you get it? Security doors! Move, or you'll be cut in half! I can't! We lost one. Looks like we've got some cutting to do. Count dooku insists that you speak with him, commander. Well, let's not keep him waiting. He's already waiting, sir. Count dooku, my lord, how unexpected. You may cease the propriety, commander Sobeck. I understand there is a problem with the jedi prisoner. An incursion team attempted a rescue, but the situation is taken care of. Are you in possession of the information the prisoner is carrying? Not yet, but we will soon have it. You are aware that this information will tip the scale of the war to the side that controls it. Perhaps this is a matter that requires my presence. No, my lord. Find them, commander. Get the information. Then kill them all. Don't ever surprise me with a transmission from count dooku. I need time to prepare! Yes, commander. I am beginning to admire the design of this fortress. It's raer formidable to evade. How can you admire such a horrible place? Ah, you reveal your shortsightedness. This ordeal only demonstrates how effective facilities like The Citadel are. Pity it ended up in separatist hands and not ours. He has a point. All right, snips, I need you to lead the group. Keep following the tunnel. I'll catch up. Hey, where are you going? Obi-Wan's not here, so someone has to protect our flank. I guess it's a good thing I came along after all. We've received a coded transmission. Apparently, they've split up into two groups. The rendezvous points are the landing field behind the tower, where artoo will pick up Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the pipeline exit, where they'll find Anakin Skywalker. And what if things don't go according to plan? Then we would have to send an entire fleet to get them out of there. I am concerned that the jedi have elected this child to lead the group. I've served with her many times, and I trust her, captain. Uh-oh. Dead end. It looks like there are security guards there. Okay, boss, we'll land and wait for general Kenobi. Uh-oh, that doesn't look like general Kenobi. We'll have to imprwvise. Your arrival is long overdue. Where haveou been? Even so, the odds are three to one that you are a traitor. We will take you to interrogation below. Yes, sir. Move it. Don't talk back to me, droid. I'm in charge. We have captured the shuttle that infiltrated our defenses. Good. Guard the shuttle, and we'll lure the jedi into a trap. Sorry, commander. Just wanted to fool them. What are your orders? You're right. If we're not at the shuttle, general Kenobi could be walking into a trap. We'll try to locate them if they get captured. Look out! What happened? Why didn't you blow the wall? That part of the plan was your job. I thought it was a dead end. If master PLO really assigned you to this mission, he would have briefed you on the plan. The shuttle's there, but there's no sign of artoo. Something might have happened. We'll have to make our way around to the other side and get a different view. This could be a trap. Anakin. I must commend you on your escape tactics, but in the end, it was easy to predict your every move. This pipe leads up to the top of the Ridge, where artoo will pick us up and get us out of here. There's the hatch. Let's go! Let's go! Everyone in. Don't use your lights, and make sure your weapons are locked. The slightest electronic pulse could ignite this whole tube. I hope somebody tells the droids that. Welcome back. I must say, you're not at all what I pictured for someone with such a soft voice. I want your half of the information. Give it to me now, or I'll start executing your men. This is war, Sobeck. We're all prepared to die to protect that intel. Really? Sir, we have located the other group, and our droids are closing in on them. Your jedi resolve only delays the inevitable. Take them to interrogation. Torture them slowly. So they were captured, huh? And now they're moving them to the prison block? Yes, sir. We will move to intercept them. We'll take them from here. Uh, I think we have a We'll handle it. Yes, sir. Good to see you, artoo. I wondered where you've been. The commander is pleased to see you as well, sir, but would like to return to the shuttle as soon as possible. Yes, I couldn't agree more. What about general Skywalker, sir? Not to worry. He'll switch to plan \"b.\" How much longer are we going to wander through this tunnel in the dark? Captain tarkin, haven't you learned to trust me by now? You may have earned my trust, general Skywalker, but my faith in your comrades is still lacking. You lack faith in the jedi. I find their tactics ineffective. The jedi code prevents them from going far enough to achieve victory, to do whatever it takes to win, the very reason why peacekeepers should not be leading a war. Have I offended you? No. I've also found that we sometimes fall short of victory because of our methods. Well, I see we agree on something. I think I found a way out. What do you see, snips? The coast is clear. Any sign of Obi-Wan and the shuttle? No, I don't see him or artoo anywhere. We've got to go. There could be a whole battalion of droids out there. Better than hiding in a fuel line. The plan's been compromised. The shuttle's not coming. Throw me a charge. Let's go. Time for plan \"b.\" There's a plan \"b\"? There's always a backup plan. We'll meet artoo at Obi-Wan's position. Based on their recent position, we believe they're traveling along this cave system. Uh, sir, the prisoners did not make it to the interrogation level. WhatDidYou JustSay? Um, we think they might have gone to the Sir, count dooku commands you to contact him immediately. Inform count dooku that I am unreachable. Send all units to the airfield. It's their only possible way of escape. Hold it. Where are you going with these prisoners? We're transferring them aboard the shuttle from Citadel to Point Tarron. Point Tarron? There's no outpost there. Uh, it's new. We have orders. We're coming aboard. Wait.! The prisoners are escaping with reprogrammed battle droids. Let no one on board that shuttle. Sorry I'm late. How nice of you to join us. The ship is surrounded. We need to launch a full forward assault and take that vessel. We may have a bigger problem: Those turrets. If we don't take them out, they will use them to destroy the shuttle and prevent our escape. Which is precisely why we should get aboard that shuttle and use the weapon systems to decimate those droids. Whatever we're gonna do, we better do it fast. General Skywalker, a droid is Manning one of those turrets. They're gonna blow up the shuttle, sir. This is our only chance. We've got to stop him. Echo, look out! Echo! We have to go now. Master Kenobi, what has happened? I'm afraid we've had a situation with the shuttle. By \"situation,\" he means \"big explosion.\" We're gonna need a rescue. It will be done. I'm sending our cruisers now. We'll need to hold out until the council sends a ship. Not a problem. We've beat them once. We'll beat them again. This landscape is almost impossible to cross. How are we going to get to the rendezvous point? That is the trap of The Citadel. It was designed so it would be almost impossible for fugitives to get off the surface, even if they escaped the tower. Oh, lucky we're not just any fugitives. I hope you're right.   \n                "}, "Eminence": {"episode": "s05e14", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tEvil alliance. Darth Maul and Savage Opress escape Obi-Wan Kenobi's assault once again. With their plan to build a crime organization in peril, the brothers' fate is about to be changed forever as they drift, barely alive, through unknown space. What are you? Should we rub 'em out? No, I want to hear their story. If they're an enemy of the Jedi, then they're a friend of mine. Load 'em up. Savage You're not Jedi. So what are you? We are Sith. Do you serve Count Dooku? I serve no one. I thought there could only be two Sith; a master and an apprentice. We are brothers. The true Lords of the Sith. What happened to your ship? Destroyed by Jedi. Do you know which Jedi? Kenobi. And what do you seek now, Sith? Fortune and power. Repair this one's legs, and do what you can for the other. Yes, sir. Go on. Get moving. In time for tea. Come join me. Made with the florets of a Cassius tree. It's good for your health. Your mark? The sign of Clan Vizsla. I am Pre Vizsla. We are the Death Watch, descendants of the true warrior faith all Mandalorians once knew. Now my people are living in exile because we will not abandon our heritage. Our people were warriors; strong, feared. Now they're ruled by the new Mandalorians who think that being a pacifist is a good thing. They've given away our honor and tradition for peace. Duchess Satine and her corrupt leadership are crushing our souls, destroying our identity. That is our struggle. If they are weak, why do you wait? The duchess has powerful allies, including your Jedi friend, Kenobi. He is also responsible for our exile. Perhaps fortune brought us together. It is the will of the Force. We can help you reclaim Mandalore. And punish Kenobi for his trespasses. We allied ourselves with Sith before. Count Dooku, he betrayed us. Sith are no better than Jedi. They claim to be powerful, but we put these two back together after the Jedi gutted them. Doubt will only lead to failure. Hold! Our combined strength will be rewarded. Mandalore will be yours, and Kenobi, this Sith pretender Dooku, and all our enemies will fall. Check on your brother. We'll put it to a vote. Rest, apprentice. You're safe. Our crash was discovered by enemies of the Jedi, and we are in their care. Are we prisoners? No. Allies. They have much to offer, including their planet. They are strong, and unlike pirates, they possess honor. Another weakness. They know nothing of our intentions. Those revelations will come too late. I see you have your strength back. Ugh. I never got your names. I am Maul. This is Savage. Our brothers are in favor of an alliance to liberate Mandalore. This duchess of yours will soon discover the true burden of peace. Your people are strong and skilled, but you'll need an army to free Mandalore. There are more on Mandalore who will join us. Their help would come too late. We can assemble an army, beginning with the Black Sun. They're a crime syndicate. Hardly a force to rally with. They can provide us with the resources we need to sustain a war without the scrutiny of the Republic. A battalion, brother. They will serve us well. We request an audience with your leaders. It'll be your funeral. Why do you come here? We seek an army. Fools. We are not mercenaries. Dispose of them. Keep their ships and weapons. Give me that one's sword. This is your last opportunity to join us. Quiet. We are the Black Sun! Hmm. Very well, then. It would seem the decision to join us is now yours. After careful consideration, we will join you. Show us your supplies. We have our army now. I have a plan to undermine Satine. The army is weak. We are not ready for the duchess. With my plan, we won't need a bigger force. There is only one plan. One vision. And it belongs to Death Watch. Your vision lacks clarity. Without us, you have no army and no reason to replace the duchess. The depth of this opportunity eludes you. You shall watch and learn. More criminals. Spice dealers connected to all the crime families of Coruscant. The Pykes. They will be the next to join us. We know you've been forming an army. Were you expecting us? Underworld's a small community. I have no desire to oppose you. We come to join you. Very good. Then ready our troops. We leave for Nal Hutta immediately.

Weeteebah fa foonta granee, meendeeya. The mighty Jabba and the Hutt families have decided to join you. Between the Hutts, Black Sun, and the Pykes, we'll have a large reserve of muscle and supplies. Yes. Then Mandalore and Kenobi are still our priority? They are vital. I'm curious to hear the rest of your plan. The vision has expanded. You will still rule Mandalore, and under your protection, I will command a new galactic underworld. Mandalore influences a league of 2,000 neutral systems. It gives you a great deal of options for your enterprise. You have learned from your previous oversights. With their combined forces, the Republic and the Separatists will be irrelevant. Then are we ready? Mobilize the army. Send an advanced guard to the capital. I want a list of targets vital to Mandalore's security. Choose wisely. There will be no second chances. Stay focused.

After a daring rescue and narrow escape, Anakin Skywalker prepares a cover attack on the enemy Ship. And it's diabolical droid commander, General Grievous. This strike force has been commisioned by the Senate to hunt down the enemy's new battleship. As the bulk of our fleets are engaged on the front lines We'll be on our own. General Skywalker has prepared our attack strategy. Thank you, Admiral. While our capital ships is vunerable to the enemy attack. I believe its squadron bombers cannot move their ion weapon Our target would be the bridge and General Grievous. The head clancker. Skywalker's getting pretty ambitious. Our bombers will attack at high speed to evade the enemy's ion weapon. We concentrate our firepower on the bridge super structure, here. We destroy Grievous, we can bring the war to a quicker end. Pilots, prepare your bombers. Skywalker, this is an aggressive plan. Are you sure your squadron can complete this mission? Matchstick, you think our boys can pull it off? Yes, Sir. There hasn't been a mission shadow squadron couldn't complete. That's right. Minimal casualties, maximum effectiveness. That's us. I admire your confidence, pilot. Even so, minimal casualties may be enough to prevent you from breaking Grievous' defenses. Master Plo is right. With Grievous on that ship's bridge, - it's bound to be well-protected. - Don't worry, Ahsoka. We'll destroy that bridge and Grievous along with it. Master Skywalker seems to inspire great confidence in his men. He does lead by example. So much for the Jedi escort. The last transport is fleeing, General. Charge the plasma rotors. - They're getting to fire, Sir. - Still setting the coordinates. Are we clear to make the jump to hyperspace? Fire ion weapon. We've lost all power. Boy, this is a lot more fun when they're not shooting back. I still can't seem to hit anything. Grievous, those battle droids are expensive. The Jedi are never that harsh with their clones. The care these Jedis show for their troops is a weakness. A weakness we shall continue to exploit. I have the coordinates for a new target: the Republic's secret outer rim medical station. It is unprotected and treating over 60,000 wounded clones. We will do them a favor and put them out of their misery. Once you have destroyed it, there will be nowhere for the Jedi to send their wounded, and they will die. It will be a pleasure, my lord. I feel very confident leaving the ship under your command, General. General. Target those escape pods. I have a reputation to uphold. - Which one's mine? - You're with me. You'll be my gunner. - Somebody's got to watch my back. - Broadside could do that. Besides, you have R2. But I so enjoy your company, my padawan. Just admit it. You don't like my flying. No, it's not that. It's just, I Skywalker, the enemy warship has attacked our convoy of medical transports near Ryndellia. Medical transports? Only General Grievous would go after clones who can't fight back. The Ryndellia system Near Naboo. Isn't that where our medical base is? I'll bet that will be his next target. There are many star clusters in that area. With a ship that big, he will be unable to chart a course that's less than ten parsecs. Looks like we're gonna have to take a shortcut. Admiral, warn that station what's coming. This journey may be treacherous. If you lose any ships before you reach the target we won't lose anybody. I will come along and fly fighter escort. Any help is welcome, Master Plo. Just try not to fall behind. I had a feeling you'd be coming along. Your ship has already been prepped. Even if we had the transports, it is not possible to evacuate all of our wounded in time. You must try. You won't stand a chance against that battleship. Nala Se, I only just received word. I've contacted the naboo. They are sending ships to help you, and I am on my way as well. Thank you, Master Jedi. If they reach us in time, do you really think they're going to stop that thing? It is our only hope. Launch the fighters. I hope you know what you're doing, Anakin. Well, if I don't, I won't be around to hear the \"I told you so.\" That's reassuring. Well, take your shortcut, and I'll take the long way, but you'd better be there - before I arrive. - I'll be there, Obi-Wan. Shadow squadron, tighten formation. Call in. Shadow 2 standing by. Shadow 3 standing by. Shadow 4 standing by. I know, \"R2-ey.\" This is gonna be a tough one. Cut the chatter, Ahsoka. Shadow 11 standing by. Shadow 12 standing by. Fighter escort ready. This is Admiral Yularan. You are cleared for hyperspace jump. - Good hunting, Sir. - Thanks, Admiral. All right, boys, let's go. Broadside, if we make it through this one, drinks are on me. I can already taste it. What's taking so long? I want to get there before too many wounded clones escape. Sorry, sir. The navi-computer has had to calculate a complex course around a large nebula near the medical station. They told me this ship was fast. Okay, if we can just manage to navigate through my shortcut, we'll be all right. A nebula can be very unpredictable. I advise caution. Don't worry about us, Master Jedi. We can hold our own, right, shadow squadron? Copy that, shadow 2. Does anyone care what the padawan thinks? Of course we care, snips, but we're still going through that nebula. Thanks, \"R2-ey.\" The evacuation is proceeding slowly, Madam. We will have to move the patients in stable condition first. The more critically injured will have to wait. What about the bacta tanks? Many of those men can't be moved at all. I know, Commander. Guide the patients that can be moved onto transports as quickly as you can. At once, Madam. This soup is thick. Can you see anything? Just keep your eyes on my thruster, shadow 2. They'll have to. The scanners are useless. This is old-fashioned flying. You have to feel your way through to stay on course. Skywalker is right, Ahsoka. Clear your mind, young one, and you will see the path. Right now, I can't see anything at all. I always know where I'm going. Yeah, where's that, Broadside? I'm gonna blow up that battleship. A clear path if ever there was one. Sir, the navi-computer indicates we only have one parsec to go. Good, we will maximize our casualties with this attack. General, there's an incoming transmission from Count Dooku. General Grievous, I have received intelligence from Lord Sidious. The republic has launched a small strike force to attack the Malevolence. Let the republic come. Our ship is unstoppable. Skywalker is leading the mission. Do not underestimate him. I assure you, Count, if anything, it is Skywalker who will underestimate this ship and its power. So, skyguy, how did you know about this shortcut? It's an old smuggler's route. The pilots used to talk about it on Tatooine. Smuggler's route? That makes me feel better. They call it the Balmorra run. Balmorra run? I think I'm picking up a contact. Skywalker, listen to me. We need to turn around. We can't, not if we're gonna catch Grievous. Another contact. This one's much larger. Skywalker, Balmorra's the nesting ground of the giant nebray mantis. Another, another! Take evasive action! Those gas-gulpers are huge. Don't shoot, or they'll panic. They'll panic? I'm about to panic. There are so many of them. I'm hit. My stabilizer's out. Pull it together, Matchstick. I'm okay. I got it. These things are gonna make a meal out of us. - All wings, line up behind me. - Roger that, boss. Hurry, they will not follow us beyond the nebula. - That one looks hungry. - Nah, it's just smiling at you. We're coming out of it. Let's hope your shortcut paid off. We're not far behind Grievous now. The medical station reports That's not good enough. They'll never be finished before the enemy arrives. General Skywalker still has a chance to catch Grievous. If he does, we have to be ready. Yes, Sir. Shadow 2, what is the damage to your ship? Just a scratch, Sir. We must not take any more unnecessary risks. If we lose even a single ship, our mission is that much closer to failure. Understood, Master Plo, but we didn't lose any ships, and I didn't - Sir, another contact. - I thought those things - wouldn't follow us. - Not following; coming out of hyperspace. It's a ship. It's the Malevolence. A squadron of Republic fighters is approaching. Skywalker. Launch fighters and bring the ship around. There are several medical transports surrounding the station. Target the transports first. I want every single ship destroyed. Roger, roger. This is too easy. We've got fighters coming in. Steady, come on. Hold it Steady. Charge the ion cannon and prepare to fire. But, Sir, our fighters will be caught in the blast. Fire at my command. Get those fighters off of us. Your fancy flying is making it difficult. Fire. - Incoming! - Make towards the edge of the ray, now! Give it everything you've got. Shadow 2, your speed is dropping. What's wrong? Nothing, sir. Just trying to keep it together. You can make it, Matchstick. Hang on. Look out! Shadow squadron, check in. We lost Matchstick and Tag. Shadows 6, 7, and 10 were caught in the ray. It looks as though Skywalker has failed. He's lost almost half his ships. We should go, Madam. I will stay. Stay on course. This flak is heavy. All deflectors double front. Master We need a new plan. We can make it, Ahsoka. Hang in there. Sir, the enemy fighters are closing. Let them come. Prepare the ion cannon. First we will destroy the medical station. Then we will finish off Skywalker. I have a bad feeling about this. Watch those towers, boys. We're too close. Loosen up. Ion cannon ready. They're targeting the station. We're running out of time. Master, you can make it, but everyone else is getting shot down. Master! Station has been targeted. Start the ion cannon acceleration. If we can do enough damage, the weapon may overload when Grievous tries to fire. Shadow squadron, new target. We're taking out the starboard ion cannon. Ion cannon 75% charged. Hurry. Torpedoes away. Fire! Good work, shadow squadron. Nice job, Ahsoka. Damage report. We've lost both primary weapons. - The hyperdrive has been disabled. - Impossible. General, we are picking up three Republic warships entering the system. - Anakin, do you copy? - I'm here. Congratulations. It looks like your mission was a success. Partially, but Grievous is still alive. The battle was pretty rough on my men. We're heading for the medical station. We'll take it from here, but don't worry. - We'll call when we need you. - I'll be waiting, Obi-Wan. All right, let's finish what Anakin started. Ahead full. Full retreat. Make for Separatist space. Great job, Master Skywalker. Your leadership skills are most impressive. You didn't do so bad yourself. Excuse me? I believe it was my suggestion to change the plan. - That's kind of true, snips. - From a certain point of view. Make sure our ships are ready. We'll only have a short time before Obi-Wan calls us for support. Yes, Sir. General Skywalker, I wanted to thank you for your valiant effort today. Do not take the lives you saved lightly. I don't, but I also can't take the lives I lost lightly. I see. If you will excuse me, I must prepare for the coming battle. Your master is a very curious Jedi. He is one of a kind. This is Senator Almadola. - Where do you think you're going? - Somebody has to save her skin. I thought you might say that.   \n                "}, "Weapons Factory": {"episode": "s02e06", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe final surge. Having learned of warlord Poggle the Lesser's plot to rebuild a separatist droid foundry on Geonosis, Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano prepare to assault this heavily-fortified installation. Their mission: destroy the factory at all cost. Anticipating stiff resistance, Republic commanders send Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and her Padawan Barriss Offee to reinforce the attack. But time runs short for our intrepid heroes as the dreaded droid mill nears completion. Captain, the only safe landing zone is south of Skywalker's position. Barriss, I assume you've made the necessary preparations? Precisely as you instructed, Master. Buckle your belts and check your cells, soldiers. We're going in. This bridge is our first waypoint. Focus your fire on the gun emplacements here and here Because it's only after we neutralize the guns - that we can push for the factory. - I was We can push for the factory. Now, expect stiff resistance from And don't forget to top off your energy cells and ration packs. Once we leave, there will be no resupply. Anything else, Ahsoka? I think you've pretty much covered everything In my briefing. Very well. Squad dismissed. - What's next? - Master, my briefings might go better if you didn't interrupt me every time I try to I wasn't. I was trying to help you. Which I would appreciate if you didn't interrupt me to do it. I just think maybe you don't trust me to give the briefing. It's not about trust. It's about getting the job done right. So you don't trust me to get the job done right. I knew it. Snips, I never said No, it's okay. I understand. I'm the Padawan. You're the Master. Good day, General. Skywalker's waiting for you. - At it again, are they? - \"Again,\" Master? Let's just say that they have a penchant for playing loose with regulations and rules of command. If you don't trust me, then maybe you should send me back. Don't tempt me, snips. If you're both finished with your little discussion, we do have a factory to destroy. Well, Barriss, aren't you going to introduce yourself? Padawan learner Barriss Offee at your service. Glad to meet you. I'm Ahsoka. It's good to see both of you again. I wish it was under more peaceful circumstances. A frontal assault is risky. Our losses will be high. But not as high as they'll be if that factory comes online. Indeed, but there is an alternative. Every Geonosian building has a series of catacombs beneath it that run deep underground. Some of the tunnels are close enough to this cliff wall so that you could cut a hole and make an entry point. Once inside, we could find the main reactor, plant the explosives, and blow the factory inside out. Looks like a good way to get lost, if you ask me. For the unprepared perhaps, but I have instructed Barriss to memorize the labyrinth, all 200 junctions. You always were thorough. It pays for one to be prepared. Right, Barriss? Especially when other people's lives depend on your success. How do we keep the Geonosians occupied while someone else is setting the bombs? Good point, snips. If whoever's going in there is going to be successful, - we'll need to create a diversion. - Precisely. That task will be carried out by you and I, while the destruction of the factory falls to the Padawans. Now, hold on. Who decided that? Walking into that factory could be suicide. Not if you and I are successful holding poggle's attention at the bridge. Master, I can do this. I've had riskier assignments. But unlike Barriss you aren't prepared for this mission. Not to worry. My Padawan is reliable. She can lead them both. We'll be in and out, Master. See? Dependable Barriss will get us through. Don't worry, Master. As you well know, I can follow orders. It's decided then. I guess it is. We'll monitor your progress on these chronometers. Three, two, one, mark. Let's get going. After you, Barriss. You feel Ahsoka's not up to the task. I never said that. What is it, then? Nothing. Let's prepare the men. We'll have to make a bold move if we're to draw them out of the factory and keep their attention on us and not the Padawans. The best way to that is to march our troops straight up the middle, parade style. They can't resist that. With no cover? We have to make it tempting. The factory is operating at 50% production capacity. We have 10 garrisons of new droids ready to deploy. No, the super tanks are not ready, but when they are, the Republic forces will be routed. They have no weapon that can penetrate its heavy armor. Here come the droids. Everybody steady. Steady. Keep marching. I hope the Padawans have made it past the bridge by now. That looks like a lot of droids. Well, it is a droid factory. As long as we can destroy 'em faster than they can make 'em, we'll come out on top. I love your simple logic, Skywalker. Here we go. Let them fall into the trap. You may now commence attack. Nice work. - Here goes nothing. - I should go in first. I know the way. Be my guest. They're sleeping. We have to find another way. We don't have time. This direction is the fastest. - Maybe you're wrong. - Trust me. They should have entered the catacombs by now. I sure hope they're not lost down there. Left at the next junction. Dead end. If we make a wrong turn, we may never find our way out. You do remember the way, don't you? Of course I do. It's not left, it's up. It's this way. - Rex, a little help here. - Get up there, trooper. My lord, I beg you to let us use the secret weapons. We have 20 units ready now and many more on the way. Deploy the super tanks. Attack formation. Looks like the Separatists have a new toy. Rex, pick your targets. Elevation four-two-seven. That's a lot of droids. Come on. The main control room is this way. Steady. Steady. Fire! Our shields are holding. They can't touch us. That's a relief. Sir, nothing could withstand that. They must be ray-shielded. This is it. We're here. Two Jedi in the control room? That is impossible. How could they have gotten past security? And now we make ourselves scarce. Green light. The bombs are active. - The Padawans did it. - And just in time. Fire! Get down! You heard his highness. Collect their pathetic little bombs, then we will kill them. See if your stupid tank can take this. Fool, the super tank is impervious to all weapons Rex, tell the men to fall back. But, sir, you can't be asking us to turn tail and run? I'm not asking you to run, Rex. I want to draw those tanks out onto the bridge. I see what you have in mind. I always come prepared, Master. Let's go. The bombs! Stupid green bugger! Fall back! Fall back! Give everything you've got. Roger, roger. Where are they? Those bombs are going to go off any second now. Rex, any sign of Ahsoka or Barriss on your side? No, sir, but this place is getting ready to blow. The evacuation ships are arriving. I suggest you get on one. Not without Ahsoka. My Padawan will not fail. Ahsoka, can you hear me? Ahsoka, where are you? Where'd she go? - The bugs took the bombs. - What are we going to do now? I don't know what to do without the bombs. This tank could destroy the power generator and probably us along with it. I guess that's our only choice. Master, can you hear me? Set off the bombs! We're trapped. I'm sorry, Master. - We can't make it out. - Can't make it out? - Ahsoka, wait! - Fire. Get down. Get down! Ahsoka, can you hear me? Come in. Master Luminara, don't worry. Be at ease, Skywalker. At ease? We need to act now. Ahsoka and Barriss may still be alive down there. There's not enough time. I sense them drifting away. No, we'll get them out. The tank lifters are here to move the debris as ordered. Get to it, Rex. How deep do you think we're buried? It's probably best not to think about it. Hand me that power cell, would you? Thanks. Mind holding the light? Whatever you're doing, I hope it works, because I'd sure rather have died fighting up there - than starve to death down here. - Don't worry. We'll run out of air long before we starve. That's a comforting thought. Thanks. Master Skywalker has taught me a trick or two. I think I can get this communicator working. We cannot abandon our Padawans. You misjudge me. I too care for my apprentice, but if their time has come I refuse to let Ahsoka die. She will find a way out. If my Padawan has perished, I will mourn her, but I will celebrate her as well through her memory. I still plan on celebrating this victory with my Padawan in person. What happens to us now doesn't matter. By destroying this factory, we've saved countless lives elsewhere. I'm about to save two more. Wait. I'm picking up a pulse on Ahsoka's comm channel. It's coming from over there. I know you're out there, and I know you're looking for me. - I'll move the heavy machinery over. - No time. Someone's digging. I knew they were still alive. I told you not to give up on them. It's not that I gave up, Skywalker, but unlike you, when the time comes, I am prepared to let my student go. Can you say the same? I knew you'd come looking for me. I never doubted you for a second. Padawan, you did well. Thank you, Master, but if it weren't for Ahsoka, we'd still be down there. Indeed. Your Master never lost faith in you.   \n                "}, "Hidden Enemy": {"episode": "s01e16", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tStar.Wars.The.Clone.Wars.S01E16 A planet under siege! Separatist forces mercilessly batter the beautiful and elegant world of Christophsis. Unable to defend themselves any longer, the people of Christophsis call on the Jedi for assistance. Hoping to save lives and prevent further destruction, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker plan a daring ambush which could turn the tide in the fight for this crucial star system. - How are you doing over there? - We're set. I've got some guys here that are anxious to get going. Glad to hear it. We're back, general. Good. The show is about to begin. How's that cannon coming, boys? We'll have this one back in business in no time, sir. The droids are advancing. I'm seeing a full battalion coming right on schedule. Tanks! They brought tanks. A little closer. They're splitting up. What? Something's gone wrong. Prepare all troops for Abort the mission! Our position's been compromised. Obi-Wan, what's going on? We're cut off. The droids are onto us. Gunship, come in. Hawk, we need an e-vac in the south tower. Roger that, sir. We're coming. - South tower? We're in the north. - Not for long. Rex, fire your cables. Blast them! - This way is clear. - How did you get over here? I improvised. Now what? Maybe this tactical droid will tell us how they knew our plan. The Republic army is in the north and south towers: level 46. It just doesn't make sense. Blast! Well, at least we're not the only ones having a bad day. Generals, they had all our intel. That would explain the ambush. How could we have left ourselves so vulnerable to a security breach? - I don't think we did. - You think someone - infiltrated our defenses? - Possibly. It'd have to be someone cunning and resourceful enough to gain access to all our plans. But that's still wouldn't explain how they got our intel. No. You're right. They wouldn't act alone. They'd have someone working with them. A spy, sir? But who would want to betray our troops to the Seppies? Excellent question, Commander. Perhaps it's time we made a visit behind enemy lines. - I think we'll find our answers there. - We'll get right on it. No, Captain. I need you here to find the security breach. - You can count on us, sir. - One more thing: this mission is extremely confidential. The spy could be anyone. Let no one know of our mission. Understood, sir. Someone left this comlink on. Someone has been listening to everything we said. Hey! Stop! Who's that? I'll follow him. You take the west corridor. I'm on it. He must have gone in the mess hall. We've got a big problem. Yeah. The only people in here are brothers. One of us? Great, but which one? We'll have to wait for his next move. Keep this to ourselves. Better contact the Jedi. I'm on it. Don't shoot. Just keep their communications jammed. Roger, roger. We can't reach General Kenobi. Whoever it is has blocked our communications. We're gonna have to find this guy ourselves. R2, come over here and plug in. What are you doing? The guard got his messages out there somehow. - We just got to find them. - What do you think? - He just sat down and wrote a note? - You have to start somewhere. We appear to have picked up some friends. Indeed. In fact, I believe the number of eyes watching us has been steadily growing. Great. Perhaps this means our adversary has learned about our mission. Perhaps it does. Of course, nobody's tried to stop us yet. Also true. They want us to get to the Separatist headquarters, which means this is a trap. I imagine it is. Well, that's unfortunate For them. R2's found something. What is it? Is it the traitor? I'm not sure. - Maybe. - What is he looking for? Wavelength interference, weak frequencies, spotty, irregular. See, how it shows up every few days then disappears? Day to day, you wouldn't notice it. - What? - It's the pattern. The band's only coming off one terminal in the whole base. Check it out. Slick's barracks. Only Sslick's men would have access to that terminal. Slick's not gonna like that. No, he's not. But if one of his men is giving away our intel, we have to find him and sort this out. No guards, no barricades, you'd think the Separatist headquarters would be better protected. But clearly, keeping us out is not what they intend. No way. My guys are the best. No way they're capable of something like this. Something like what? - You called them here? - Of course we did. We're getting to the bottom of this Now. Look, let me have a few minutes with them first. It's gonna hit them hard. They trust each other, and if one of our own betrayed us I don't think that's necessary. Your men are tough, right? Take a seat, gentlemen. We have a turncoat in our midst, and we think it's one of you. So this is the belly of the beast. Ventress. And here I thought this mission would be unpleasant. The pleasure's all mine, my dear Obi-Wan. I've missed you. I don't know, I was doing the things I always do after a mission. - Things like what? - I'm sorry, sir. I'm just a little nervous. You're my C.O. The way I figure it, you tell the truth, you got nothing to be nervous about. Jester is telling the truth. He cleans his weapon after every mission. First thing, every time. He's kind of obsessed that way. Is that right? - You were cleaning your weapon? - Yes, sir. Go on the computer while you were in here? No, sir. I didn't even power it up. You can check. Show me your weapon. Yep, freshly scrubbed. - The rag's over there in the corner. - Good man. You. - You were cleaning your weapon too? - No, I was hungry. I went back to the mess. - Right away? - Yeah. Anyone with you? Sketch, sir. We got to the mess at the same time, got our grub, and sat together. Anyone else in the mess able to confirm what you two are saying? Lots of guys there. Ask any of them. - We will. - Captain, give me a moment with them. No, it's okay, Sarge. I got nothing to hide. I was in the infirmary. Got banged up pretty good by one of those clankers. A med droid was fixing me up. Doc's got all the records there if you want to check. So, Chopper, old boy, - what's your alibi? - I was in the mess hall. No, you weren't! I mean, you If you know something, kid, you should speak up. Chopper came in a lot later. After everyone else. My loyal informant let me know you were coming. Well, then, we thank you for your hospitality. Where were you before you went to the mess, Chopper? Nowhere. Walking around. Son, you know we'll need a better answer than that. I was hiding at the south exit. I didn't want anyone to see me string these together. Battle droid fingers. I just I just wanted something back. I guess I felt like they owed me. I always knew there was something deficient about you. This isn't good, Chopper. Lying about where you were, taking forbidden items from a battlefield. I know. I put up with the attitude 'cause you have skill. But if you could break these rules, your whole character's in question here. Wait, no! Hang on. I'm no spy! Chopper, we're all brothers. But how can we trust anything you say now? - No, sir, I'm telling you, I did not - It's okay. We'll get you a proper investigation. You don't have to say anything till the Jedi come back and talk to you. Maybe you should talk, sir. Tell them where you went. I was at the south exit, remember? I saw you go in go in, sir. I saw you. Chopper, I have been patient. Everyone else turned right toward the barracks and the mess. You turned left, toward the command center. - Where were you going, sir? - Obviously, the kid feels cornered. Sergeant, what did you mean, \"Till the Jedi come back\"? How did you know the Jedi were gone? I really wish you hadn't noticed that, sir. It's Slick? Slick's the traitor? - I've got someone by the gunships. - That's our Slick. Now that he's exposed, he has to get out of this base. There's no escape now, you piece of rankweed! Move. Move! He took out our weapons depot. He knew where we'd look. He's not trying to escape. He knows all our moves before we even make them. Give up, Ventress! I am all yours, Obi-Wan. You've served your purpose. - We have to get back. Now! - It's already too late. So hard to know whom to trust these days, isn't it? What's the plan, Master? Bringing us here was a mistake, my sweet. You've overestimated your abilities. Really? Come and get me, boys! You didn't tell us you were bringing friends. Poor Obi-Wan. You've been betrayed. And now we're about to take control of this world. - How do we get this guy? - Sir. Slick ran into the command center. You guys stay here. Seal the perimeter. Prepare to march on the city. Have General Loathesome delay the Jedi as long as possible. I will need time to execute the next part of my Master's plan. Yes, Mistress. Pretend you're Slick. What's in your head? My cover's blown, it's time to go, but I decide not to use a ship because it's too obvious. The lockdown. He wants to get around the lockdown. He's blinded us by taking out the power. He could disable the entire security system. But he knows we'd expect him to do that. Or does he? - Yeah, I see what you're getting at. - Go to the south exit. - What are you gonna do? - I'll stay here, get the power back up. - That'll help. - Got it. Hey, there, Slick. Gun's empty. You know what's funny, traitor? We knew you'd never take a chance on the exits while they were blocked. I'd stay here to open them myself first. Just like you. Don't do a job till you've guaranteed the best odds, right? You knew I was here. Of course we knew. You think we wouldn't have a plan? I'm not the traitor. You are! All of you just blindly following orders, for what? At least I got something out of all this suffering. I bet you sold out your brothers for some real shiny coin. Yes, she offered me money. But she offered me something more important. Something you wouldn't understand. Freedom! I think freedom's gonna have to wait, kid. Slick? - It was you? - He gave us a bit of a chase, sir. You couldn't be a greater disappointment. How could you do this to your brothers? Only a Jedi would ask that. It's the Jedi who keep my brothers enslaved. We do your bidding. We serve at your whim. I just wanted something more. And all you had to do to get it was put the rest of us all at risk. I love my brothers. You're too blind to see it, but I was striking the blow for all clones. If you loved your brothers, you wouldn't have put them at risk. You betrayed everyone of us. Take him to lockup. Were you able to salvage anything from the weapons depot? Slick pretty much scorched the whole thing. That seemed to be what he was going for all along. We managed to save the heavy cannons, though.

Disguised as Jedi killer, Rako Hardeen, Obi-Wan Kenobi works undercover to solve a Separatist plot against Chancellor Palpatine. Obi-Wan meets the plot's mastermind, Moralo Eval, breaking him out of jail to gain his trust. But now, Kenobi faces another obstacle, bounty hunter, Cad Bane. Can Obi-Wan Kenobi overcome Bane's suspicions? Or will the ruthless criminal see through his disguise and expose the Jedi? Only time will tell. We're coming in too fast, Hardeen. Are you trying to kill us? They'll be waiting for us at every space port. We have to ditch the ship. You mean you're going to intentionally crash us into the swamp? Yeah, that is exactly what I'm gonna do. He's right. We have no choice. Get ready for a fast exit. Nobody can trace us here. The swamp will swallow up the ship. So we leave no trace of our crash. Moralo Eval likes a man who plans ahead. You do have a plan? Yeah, I know Nal Hutta. We can get a new ship at the Bilbousa Bazaar, but this time, we buy one. Otherwise, we'll have the authorities back on our tail. Not so fast. We need to ditch these prison fatigues. We'll have a bounty on our heads for escaping and I don't like to stand out. That's local security. Keep moving. We'll get some new gear and equipment. Pablo's pawn shop has everything a bounty hunter needs and more. Now all I need's a new hat. For trying to blend in, your hat sure makes you stand out. I don't like to hide under a helmet. Is there anything else you desire? A new ship? Your choice of weapons is lousy, Pablo. Where can I get some quality blasters? I wouldn't be too picky being on the run, like you obviously are. I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you, Pablo. We'll get our weapons elsewhere. Thanks for the hat. For your trouble. That trader's heard worse threats than yours, Bane. Probably calling the Hutts right now, seeing what kind of bounty there is on us. Relax. On this slime-pool, everybody's an outlaw. Besides, they'll be looking for three of us. So we're splitting up. You find a ship, we'll get weapons. Not so fast. If it's all the same to you, I'll get the weapons. It's not the same to me. You crashed the ship, you get us a new one. It does seem fair. Soon as we have a ship, we ditch Hardeen. Really? We'll throw him to the Hutts. While they interrogate him, we'll be long gone. Tell me, is this business or personal? Both. No, no, no. That's my final offer. All right then, it's a deal. Good timing. Soon as you pay for the ship, we can get moving. With pleasure. Hey, where's my weapon? Won't need it. You're not coming. Says who? He doesn't want to split his fee for breaking me out of prison. And also, he despises you. All I know is I'm not going anywhere without my reward. I'm sorry. This is between you two. What's it gonna be, Bane? Here's your reward, I'm not killing you. Where am I? You're a guest of the Hutts. If you do not answer my questions about your two partners, we will not be so hospitable. You call this hospitable? Wait. Torture won't be necessary. My partners double-crossed me, but I put a tracking device on their ship. Let me down and I'll tell you the frequency. Now tell us the tracking frequency. Yes, Count Dooku. I'm sorry I was delayed. I'm free now. I'll try to reach Serenno as soon as possible. No more excuses, Eval. Time is running short. Yes, Count Dooku, no more excuses. You said it yourself, Eval. You're free now. I want my money. After the weapons and the ship, I have very few credits left. You'll be paid when we reach Serenno. What is this? Who is attacking us? The Hutts! How did they find us so quickly? Hardeen, trying to even the score. The engines are fried, we'll have to turn back. Their ship will crash soon on Nal Hutta. Be there to capture the fugitives. You found the ship like I said. Our deal was you'd let me go now. The deal has changed. This is Ben. I apologize for being out of communication, but the situation was rather tenuous. Although, it now appears things may be on track soon. Here's what I need, have the bounty on us removed. If I can win over Cad Bane, I can learn more about Eval's plot. But there can be no more complications. So no matter what reports you hear, do not contact me or send help. And one more thing, I shall need enough credits to buy a new ship. Why are you removing the bounty on the three fugitives? If they're free to move, they could lead us back to Eval's operation. Very well. Keep me apprised. You look troubled, Anakin. How can they expect me to just sit here and do nothing with Obi-Wan's murderer on the loose? It is possible that they do not trust you to control your feelings. Hardeen killed my master, my best friend! And now he's escaping with Cad Bane and Moralo Eval, and the Jedi Council won't do anything about it! I have it from a reliable source that the fugitives were last headed towards Nal Hutta. You cannot deny your feelings, Anakin. They are what make you special. If you believe you can stop this plot against me, I trust you. Thank you, Chancellor. You won't regret this. No. I won't. Oh, back so soon? Let me guess? You missed me? Watch it! Kill me and you won't get off Nal Hutta. Moralo Eval is running out of time and patience. Let the man talk. Look, I've got a ship. You've got the Hutts on your tail, so you make me a partner in everything. Your deal is accepted. No. First I wanna know where you got the credits to buy a ship? You thought you left me for dead, but the Hutts owed me a favor. So you had them shoot us down? You would've done the same thing, Bane. The way I see it, we're even now. Now that we're all friends, get me off this festering stink-hole. Wait, who's going to pay for this mess? So about your fee from Eval, a 50/50 split sounds fair to me. Over my dead corpse. Don't tempt me. What makes you think Obi-Wan's murderer is on Nal Hutta? I got a tip from the Chancellor himself. How are we gonna find them? Ahsoka, you should know by now. If you want to find a lowlife You start at the saloon. Hey, ladies, where are we going next? I love you guys. The fugitives are already gone. All three of them were here? Two came in, met the third. When did they leave? Nothing's free on Nal Hutta, especially information. I don't have time for games. You just missed them. Keep talking. I heard one of them say they just bought a ship. Let's go, Snips. Captain Rex, I need to speak with General Skywalker. He's not responding to my calls. Sir, General Skywalker is unavailable. Where is he, Captain? I can't say, sir. You can't or you won't? Anakin is on Nal Hutta. Nal Hutta? Protecting me is only postponing the problem, not solving it. With all due respect, Chancellor, the Council has a plan in place. Yes, and so does Moralo Eval, who appears to be several steps ahead of you. For that reason, I asked Anakin to take action. He is confident he can find the fugitives and stop this plot against me. I suggest you have more faith in young Skywalker. Captain, if you must escort me home, I'm leaving now. Yes, sir. This is exactly what Obi-Wan didn't want to happen. If I warn him, it could blow his cover, get him killed. Kill Hardeen, Skywalker might. Or die trying, he may. Warn them both, you must. Overdue, the truth is. How do you know they couldn't have gotten very far? So you only gave them enough fuel to reach the nearest filling station on Orondia, which is owned by your brother? Well, that's a nice little money-making scam. We better get going. Orondia's pretty deserted. They may steal a ship there, to throw us off their trail. I like your thinking. Here, take it. I just want to get out of here. We're being swindled. Who sells a ship with only enough fuel to get to this lousy rock? The way I see it, you keep paying off everybody but me. Yeah, why is that? Look! It's Cad Bane. Are you sure? Ugh, who else wears a hat like that? Good point. Now what? Jedi! Take over! I'll bring them down! I'll take care of him. No! It's my turn to kill a Jedi! Anakin. You're going to pay for what you did. You shouldn't have gotten involved. This is for Obi-Wan. You can thank me later, Hardeen. You had your chance to kill him. Now it's my turn. Anakin, don't follow me. The ship is still operational. I got it working. Now let's get out of here. You're lucky we're in a hurry, little lady. We'll have to dance another time. Master! Master, are you all right? What is it? What's wrong? That's why I felt a connection. Obi-Wan is still alive. - I don't understand. - I don't, either. But we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

So where did you get the lightsabers? Stole them. Bounty hunter, then? No. Ever considered it? You certainly have the right Disposition. Never thought about it. Does it pay well? Very well. We have a job to do and you owe us a man. Join our merry band of bounty hunters, or we turn you over to the authorities. What do I have to do? Hey, Bossk, who's your girlfriend? Shut up, Dengar. Hey, boss. \"Boss.\" This is your boss? You got a problem with that? My name's Boba, and this is Highsinger. I see you've already met Bossk and Latts. What's your name? I don't have a name. So it's going to be like that, huh? Look, kid, I don't take orders very well. Especially from someone of your stature, and obvious lack of experience. She killed Oked. So she agreed to fill in for him on this particular job. Or, like I said, we can always find another way to settle your debt. That won't be necessary, I'm a little short of work right now anyway. She's a little rough around the edges, but we need six hunters. Without her, we got no job. Fine. Let's get going. Don't we settle first? What? You don't trust us? When the job's done, you'll get your cut. Just like the rest of us. Welcome. Welcome. I am Major Rigosso. We are thrilled to have you here. Please allow me the pleasure of explaining the mission. These elevators will take us beneath the surface of the planet below. Waiting there is a sub tram which is carrying very precious cargo. Your mission is to protect the tram as it makes its way to the final destination. And what is this precious cargo? That's none of your concern. Just make sure it gets where it's going. And where exactly is it going? To my lord, Otua Blank. He rules over this planet with an iron fist. If you fail to protect his cargo, losing your bounty will be the least of your concerns. This way, please. Why do we have to travel by sub tram? Wouldn't it be easier just to land at our destination? You'd think so. The atmosphere of our planet is completely pressurized, leaving all aerial travel impossible. If we attempted to land on the planet's surface, our ship would immediately implode. Sub tram it is then. So why hire six expensive bounty hunters to move cargo? There's a group of marauders that would like nothing more than to hijack my master's cargo. So far, my men have been ineffective against them. They've arrived. No matter what happens, do not open this box. You make the rules, I follow them. So that's it? That is what we're protecting? Who cares? As long as we get paid. My lord, Otua Blank, will meet us on the other side. Good luck. After them! Okay, Boba, the cargo is secure. Latss, you and Highsinger stay there. I'll be in the engine room with Bossk. I sent the new girl and Dengar to the back. Hello, darling, looks like we're securing the back platform together. Wonderful. So what do you think is in that box? Whatever it is, it better be worth all this effort. Heads up, people, we got company. Latts, Highsinger, get ready! They're here! Protect the cargo at all costs. Goodbye. Oh, no, you don't. Poodoo. I'll check the cargo, stay here. Oh, hey, boss, you'd better get down. They're boarding from the rear, I could use a hand back here! Hold your position! Bossk, get to the back and help the rookie! I'm on it. Stop him, he's the leader! You! I want what's mine! Over my dead body. What? Don't worry, I'll protect you. Hey! Pluma, are you okay? Brother, you came for me! Of course I did. Well, well, well, what do we have here? Stay back! That little girl is worth a lot of money to me. Now step aside! Stop it! Krismo! That girl's crazy! We're protecting her? Try not to be such a novice. Open your eyes, she's on their side. It doesn't matter, tie them down and let's finish this job. Is this really necessary? None of this was my choice. I never asked to be ripped away from my home, from my family. You'll never know what it's like. I wish I didn't, but I do. You're just doing this for the money. It's just another job to you. You don't even care what's going to happen to us once it's over. Hey, rookie! I need you in the back. You're right, you are just another job that I couldn't care less about. Don't move. We're almost to the drop-off point. Soon, I'll be delivering that brat to the warlord and collecting a handsome bounty which you will get your share of. Share of? There's only two of us left. I get half. Half? Please. You just got to the game. Boy, don't test me. I will be delivering the cargo and collecting the bounty. No one of true importance would lower themselves to trade with a mere boy. Boy? You have no idea who you're talking to. I have been in charge of this whole operation No, you have no idea who you are talking to. Welcome! Ah! Finally, my bride. Uh, bride? Uh-uh-uh. Bounty first. Your unmarked credits as promised. Enjoy! My bride! At last! Ugh! You pay my price first then you get the girl. How do I know you won't take the credits and then hand us over? You don't. Run along now. Thank you. You made it? I don't believe it! Here's the payment, I already subtracted my share. Boba's is in there too, make sure he gets it. Where is he? He'll turn up. Well, you certainly turned out to be quite the member of the team, didn't you? I'm not part of any team. You're too good for us now, is that it? No. Once I was just like you, but I'm not that person anymore. Now, I have a future.   \n                "}, "Brain Invaders": {"episode": "s02e08", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t\\n Victory on Geonosis! After a massive assault, the Republic has finally recaptured the Separatist planet and shut down its droid factories of doom. An investigation by Luminara Unduli led to the discovery of Queen Karina the Great, whose hive-mind could reanimate dead Geonosian soldiers. During the destruction of the Queen's temple, the Jedi apprehended her advisor Poggle the Lesser, and now prepare to deliver the villain to Coruscant for trial I'm afraid we have a complication. Don't we always? I've just received a distress signal from our forces on Dantooine. Master Windu's defenses held, but at a great cost to his men. They need medical supplies immediately. We can obtain these supplies at the medical station near Ord Cestus. We're delivering Poggle to Coruscant, and Cestus is not exactly on the way. The Republic must begin debriefing Poggle right away if we're to get useful intelligence from him. Master, I suggest we let our padawans handle the supply mission. Whatever needs to be done, Master. I'm happy to help. As am I. Very well. Take a medical frigate. And after we've delivered Poggle to Coruscant, we'll rendezvous with you for the voyage to Dantooine. Sorry, boys. Hope I didn't interrupt any pleasant dreams. Got another mission, sir? You bet. We're making a medical supply run to Ord Cestus. Ugh. Thought we were bred for battle, not running errands. Hey. We were bred to follow orders, Pulsar. You got a problem with that? No, sir. No problem. That's what I thought. Now move. Scythe. Come on. Up, brother. Up and at 'em. Hey, Scythe. Welcome back to the land of the living. Thank you, sir. We are ready to make our jump, Master Fisto. Good. I look forward to your arrival. What? What is it? It's too quiet. It's a big change from all the fighting the last few days. You should enjoy this peace while it lasts. I can't. Let's go eat. I was just thinking about what you said earlier about enjoying the peace while it lasts. As a Jedi, I'm not sure I know how to do that. Master Windu has said we are keepers of the peace, not warriors. However, once the war is over, it will be our job to maintain the peace. Yes, but will we do so as keepers of the peace or warriors? And what's the difference? I don't have all the answers, Ahsoka. Like you, I'm a learner. What does your Master tell you? Anakin? Oh, um, you might find some of his thoughts on the future, uh, a bit radical. Really? Why? Let's just say my Master will always do what needs to be done. I'm not even sure how peacetime will agree with him. Just come up to check on us, Scythe? Well, we are on course, and all systems are green. What the--? We have control of the bridge. Evening, Ox, Edge. Would you like to join us? Is something wrong, troopers? Troopers, stand down! What are you doing? Two clones just attacked us. What is going on? Trap, do you know what happened to those troopers? Couldn't tell you, Commander. I'm just as confused as-- You're in charge of those men. Did you order them to kill us? No, sir. I did not. What's happening? Why would they do this? We don't know. We heard shots. Why should we believe you? Look, no guns. These men wouldn't just attack us without reason. My Master had a clone betray them once, a traitor who was paid off by Ventress. It can't be that simple. At least, it didn't feel like that. Excuse me, sir. We should make sure that we're still in control of the bridge. Bridge, this is Barriss. Respond. We need to get up there. We need to find out what's going on. But these two will be coming around any minute. Havoc can watch them until we check on the bridge. Okay, let's go. The cargo ship failed to check in on schedule. I attempted to contact them. There is no reply. I don't like it. Something's up. It is certainly most unlike either padawan to lose contact. They're in trouble. Anakin, have faith in your padawan. She would have checked in. Like you always do? Good point. Sometimes I don't think you realize how alike you two have become. We need to continue our interrogation of Poggle. Yes, agreed. He's being most uncooperative. Keep your ears open in case Ahsoka calls. Got it. Engage the autopilot and put up the security shields. Someone doesn't want us going up there. I'll attempt to override the controls. He's infected! Get this thing off me! Ugh, what is that? Looks like some type of parasite. It must be controlling their actions. Mind control. Well, that explains a lot. Trap was my friend. He would never have tried to kill us. How did these things get on board in the first place? They must have infected the clones while they were on Geonosis. We'll have to quarantine the ship. We should also contact Master Fisto and let him know about the situation. Let's go. - That sound, it's - Geonosian. We have to help him. It's too late. Barriss, let's go for the vent. I'll go to the reactor room and disable the thrusters. You head for the aft comm-center and send a warning to Master Fisto. We have to stop the ship from reaching the medical station. I don't know, Barriss. I think we should stay together. As do I. Unfortunately, that's not a luxury we have right now. One of us must succeed, Ahsoka. If you need to, you'll do what must be done. I know it. Yes, of course. Then I'll see you soon. As long as these things are on board, we dare not dock with the medical station. You must bring the ship in. The only way we can stop these parasites is to analyze them. You don't understand how terrible these things are. What if they get loose? We will take precautions. I have a bad feeling about this, Master Fisto, but I will follow your instructions. If there's one thing we clones know, it's how to stop a Jedi. No! Almost got it. Cargo ship TB-73, this is clone Captain Rex. Please respond. Rex, this is Ahsoka. Boy, am I glad to hear your voice. Likewise, sir. I've got someone here who wants to speak with you. Ahsoka, what's going on? Are you okay? Well, not exactly. Make sure you have a wrist com. Keep it on. I'm going to interrogate Poggle. He might have some answers. Find Barriss and wait for my signal. Barriss, you're back. Were you successful? Barriss, what's wrong? Barriss, no! I'm your friend! Barriss, snap out of it! Barriss! It's not you! It's the creatures. Fight them! Leave us. You will answer my questions. Your feeble Jedi mind tricks do not work on Geonosians. The other Jedi already learned this. Mind tricks? I don't need mind tricks to get you to talk. I will never talk, Jedi. We'll see about that, Poggle. I made contact with Ahsoka. What's their status? Geonosian parasites have infected her crew. How did they get on board her ship? Poggle said the parasites must have need a new host after we raided the Queen's temple. You interrogated Poggle? I did. There wasn't time to get the rest of you. How did you get him to talk? Look, all that matters is that he told me how to stop the worms. This is Ahsoka. Come in. Ahsoka, listen to me. The worms are affected by the cold. Cold? That's how we stop them? Rupture the coolant system. Did you hear me? Rupture the coolant system. The coolant system. Got it. That's Ahsoka's ship. It just came out of hyperspace. Send out the tugs to help guide them in. Warn all medical hazard crew that I don't want anyone boarding that ship until the parasites are contained. Sound all the alarms and prepare the subzero conduits. Engage tractor beam. There you are. You can't hide from me. The bridge, at last. We're coming in awfully fast. This is Ahsoka Tano. Can you hear me? I'm shutting down the engines. I'll try to reverse the-- I've having a hard time slowing her down! There's no one at the controls. The pilot must be dead. Sir, she's listing. The escort ships must maintain control. Kill me, please. I can't. Full power now. Now! We got her. We got her. Attach the subzero conduits. The temperature's below freezing, sir. Let's board, then, but stay on guard. They may still be dangerous. Hello, Master Fisto. We're ready to pick up the supplies. We'll take care of that. You rest now, Ahsoka. It's all right, Ahsoka. It's okay. You're safe. Barriss? Barriss is fine, thanks to your efforts. And so are the clones. What were those things? I think I can help answer that. We had the parasite worms analyzed. They are the same type of creature you found on Geonosis, Master Skywalker. We'll have to inform the troops on Geonosis. This parasite might explain how they recaptured the planet the first time. I don't want it happening again. You have been through quite an ordeal, little one. Master Skywalker, may I have a word? Master, on the ship, Barriss was gone, and she wanted me to kill her. She told me-- But you couldn't do it. No. No, I couldn't. But should I have? I mean, it worked out now, but if we had failed, if the ship docked and the worms spread, and Ahsoka, it's your duty to save as many lives as you can. Barriss knew you could save thousands if the worms were destroyed, which she thought meant destroying her too. But you did the right thing. You knew the freezing cold would kill the worms. Letting go our attachments is a difficult struggle for all of us. You followed your instincts. I'm sure she would agree that you made the right choice.   \n                "}, "The Wrong Jedi": {"episode": "s05e20", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tAhsoka Tano captured! While on the run to prove her innocence, Padawan Tano teamed up with the deadly Asajj Ventress to find the rogue Jedi who framed Ahsoka for murder. The Jedi Council sent Anakin Skywalker and Master Plo Koon to track Ahsoka down and bring her back to the Temple. Now captured and imprisoned, Ahsoka faces punishment for crimes she did not commit. The Senate requests that Ahsoka Tano be indicted for acts of treason against the Republic. A fair trial Padawan Tano will have in accordance with Jedi tradition. Ah, yes, Jedi tradition. I'm afraid, Master Yoda, that the Senate believes that an internal Jedi trial would seem biased. Therefore, the Senate asks that the Council expel Ahsoka Tano from the Jedi Order so that she may be put to a Republic Military tribunal, where she will receive more impartial judgment. And who would represent Ahsoka in this tribunal, Admiral? That would be up to the Council, General, but I would recommend someone outside the Order. Of course. The Council will act as they deem necessary. Thank you, Admiral. Surely we cannot do what Tarkin suggests. We need to stand together with Ahsoka. And yet there's evidence that she is indeed the mastermind behind the attack on the Temple. She was found in possession of nanodroid explosives. This alone is enough to convict her. I understand your sentiment, Obi-Wan, but if the Council does as you suggest, it could be seen as an act of opposition to the Senate. I'm afraid we have little choice. Hmm. To the Chamber of Judgment, summon Skywalker and his Padawan, and in our decision, may the Force guide us. You're not helping. I'm sorry, Snips. I just--I just don't know what to do. It's okay. I don't either. Padawan Tano, serious charges have been levied against you. How plead you? Not guilty, Master. I would never take the lives of innocents. The values of the Jedi are sacred to me. There is evidence to the contrary. You were alone with Letta Turmond when she died. Can you explain this? Someone used the Force against her. Which brings us to Ventress. Can you explain your association with her? We had a mutual understanding. I thought she was helping me. Did you she help you acquire the nanodroid weaponry found when you were apprehended, the same devices used in the bombing of the Temple? No, I was set up and deceived, as you are being deceived now. The question is, Padawan Tano, who is deceiving us? Ventress, you, or someone else? I am not deceiving you. I would assume Ventress is, but I can't be sure. My sense is clouded. Clouded by the dark side these things are, Padawan Tano. Dangerously clouded, but not just surrounding you, surrounding many things in these times. You've already made your decision, haven't you? This meeting is just a formality! Reached a decision, we have, though not in total agreement are we. It is the Council's opinion that Padawan Ahsoka Tano has committed sedition against the Republic, and thus, she will be expelled from the Jedi Order. You can't do this! Your Padawan status will be stripped from you, and you shall forfeit all rank and privileges within the Grand Army of the Republic. You will be turned over to the Republic courts to await your trail and whatever punishment they will set for you. Henceforth, you are barred from the Jedi Order. Padm\u00c3\u00a9 has agreed to represent you before the Senate. I will do everything I can to prove your innocence, Ahsoka. I am almost certain that the person behind this is Ventress, and you know I wasn't working with her. She was at the warehouse in the room. We fought, but she got away. Didn't any of the clones see anything? No, none of the clones reported seeing Ventress at the scene. I thought you said Ventress left before you went into the warehouse. That's what I thought, too, but then she attacked me when I got inside. I'd know her red lightsabers anywhere. Well, if that's our only lead, then I know what I have to do. Wait, where are you going? You can't leave now. Yes, I can. I have to find Ventress and get to the bottom of this. Until we hear from Anakin, let's work on your defense. Forgive me if I'm not optimistic. I thought I was part of that Order, but everyone, except Anakin, has abandoned me. I'm not holding out much hope the Senate will treat me any better. Anakin Skywalker. I know you're behind all of this. Prove it. Leave me alone. Tell me what happened. When I heard your little brat was on the run, I thought she might bring a large bounty. Bounty? I was going to catch your pet and turn her over to the authorities, collect whatever bounty was due. What stopped you? At first--I admit--I was just interested in the money and a little bit of revenge, but then I realized your fallen Padawan and I had a lot in common. How dare you compare yourself to Ahsoka? It's true. My master abandoned me, and that's exactly what you did to her, you and your precious Jedi Order. Ahsoka Tano, you have been charged with sedition against the Jedi Order and the Republic itself. This court will decide your fate. Prosecution, you may begin your arguments. Former Padawan Tano, I shall prove that you were the mastermind behind the attack on the Jedi Temple and that once your accomplices carried out your orders, you eliminated them one by one. When you are found guilty, I ask the court that the full extent of the law be brought down upon you, including penalty of death. After I left the warehouse, after I left your little Padawan alone, I was walking away, and I thought she came up behind me to talk more. But I was wrong. Someone came out of nowhere and hit me from behind. Not just anyone can sneak up behind me. It had to be another Jedi. I don't believe you. Believe it. Whoever you're looking for has my lightsabers. That's how you'll know you've found the criminal. Well, this leads me to a dead end. You're the only one Ahsoka had talked to. That's not true. What do you mean? Your Padawan contacted the Temple. She spoke to someone named Barriss. That's why we knew to go to the warehouse in the first place. It was this Barriss that told us to go there. If you're lying, you're dead. Such promises. Look at the facts. Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cell to reveal the name of the true mastermind behind the bombing of the Jedi Temple. Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid. She told her the mastermind was a Jedi, and before she could reveal the Jedi's name, Letta Turmond was strangled to death by way of the Force. Why would Ahsoka kill Letta with a method that would so obviously tie the murder to her? A Jedi may be responsible for the murder, but that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano. Members of the court, you are prosecuting the wrong Jedi. Well said, Senator Amidala. However, if she is innocent, then why was she seen conspiring with known Separatist terrorist Asajj Ventress? Ventress set me up. My master will prove that. And where is your master? He's trying to find the real murderer. Then maybe he should be looking at you. Enter. Barriss, I need to talk to you. Master Skywalker, how can I help you? I was told that you spoke with Ahsoka before she was arrested. What did you say to her? We've been friends for a long time. I was only trying to help her. I hope I'm not in any trouble. It's no trouble. I just need to know what you told her and if you told anyone else. No, I thought I had a clue for her, but I really couldn't tell her anything. Who told you I spoke to her? Ventress. She told me. Ventress? Isn't she the one Ahsoka says is really behind all this? That's what Ahsoka says, but I think she's wrong. Ventress thinks someone else is involved. And you believe her? Who else could it be if not her? Surely not Ahsoka. No, I don't think it was Ahsoka either. I think both Ahsoka and Ventress are telling the truth, but there's only one way to find out. Funny. Those belong to Ventress. You should've gotten rid of them! I think they suit me. I'm sure many of you look at this former Jedi and think, \"Surely she cannot be this murderer or saboteur that they speak of.\" And yet think of all the times we have been fooled by the Separatists and how they have infiltrated the Republic and ask yourself, \"Is this yet another Separatist scheme?\" Another way to rip the Jedi, and subsequently all of us, apart. Ahsoka trusted you, and you betrayed her. I've learned that trust is overrated. The only thing the Jedi Council believes in is violence. Cease hostility! Barriss! Look out! The members of the court have reached a decision. Ahsoka Tano, by an overwhelming count of-- Chancellor. I hope you have a reason for bursting into our proceedings, Master Skywalker. I'm here with evidence and a confession from the person responsible for all the crimes Ahsoka has been accused of. Barriss Offee, member of the Jedi Order and traitor. Barriss, is that true? Tell them the truth. I did it because I've come to realize what many of people in the Republic have come to realize, that the Jedi are the ones responsible for this war, that we've so lost our way that we have become villains in this conflict, that we are the ones that should be put on trial, all of us! And my attack on the Temple was an attack on what the Jedi have become, an army fighting for the dark side, fallen from the light that we once held so dear. This Republic is failing! It's only a matter of time. Take her away. Ahsoka, I am so sorry about everything. You have our most humble apologies, little 'Soka. The Council was wrong to accuse you. You have shown such great strength and resilience in your struggle to prove your innocence. This is the true sign of a Jedi Knight. This was actually your great trial. Now we see that. We understand that the Force works in mysterious ways, and because of this trial, you have become a greater Jedi than you would have otherwise. Back into the Order you may come. They're asking you back, Ahsoka. I'm asking you back. I'm sorry, Master, but I'm not coming back. Ahsoka, wait! Ahsoka, I need to talk to you. Why are you doing this? The Council didn't trust me, so how can I trust myself? What about me? I believed in you. I stood by you. I know you believe in me, Anakin, and I'm grateful for that. But this isn't about you. I can't stay here any longer, not now. The Jedi Order is your life. You can't just throw it away like this. Ahsoka, you are making a mistake. Maybe, but I have to sort this out on my own, without the Council and without you. I understand. More than you realize, I understand wanting to walk away from the Order. I know.   \n                "}, "Padawan Lost": {"episode": "s03e21", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t Sous-titres: [swclonewars.1allo.com] /!Correction needed/! / La 501ime pr\u00c3\u00a9sente: TCW S03E21 - Padawan Lost - Without humility, courage is a dangerous game. / Turmoil on the outer rim !

The others will be coming. I don't understand. Why wont this thing work. The Trandoshan deactivate the blasters if you take them. That is why none of us have any. It's been a long time since the Trandoshan captured an other padawan and brought them here. - Thanks. - I don't mean that is an insult. I mean it as a . . And mistake. On their part, Ahsoka. You're energy, you're  . It's what we've been blackin.  begining to loose hope and forgot who we are. And who are you? We are Jedi. All right, we need a strategy. So, what do you suggest? What about a base. They must have a  or something, right? Not . ever seen. So where do they come from? Well, we don't know. . If we're going to go to the offensive, we need to find out where they live. We'll start covering ground tomorow. We already covered the beach area. And most of the brayer on this side of the baie. If it's was easy to find, you guys will find it before I got here. Truenought. Maybe we should try more in land. That's where they shot. Guys, I think we're looking in the wrong place. That's their fortress. Split up! O-Mer this way. Kalifa! Finish her, my son. Kill is yours. I will kill her, with my own hands. Come here you jedi  . Not so impressive, are you? And you'll have be the honor of being my first Jedi Kill. Firts of many, I hope. Carefull. It's okay. I can make it. Kalifa! Those jedi  kill my son.  There's no escape. I'll hunt you down! Move us in closer! Can't.  too  . Kalifa, we have to move. Hury. Please. Ahsoka, leave me. - I wont. - You have to. Ahsoka, please take care of. I'll take care of the others. I know you will. I'll kill you! You kill my son! I'll kill you! Get hunt for free. What is Ahsoka streight. She is furless. That can also be a weakness. Is she  the aprentis. No one has her kind of determination. Except you. I'll find her. This may not be with in your power. What ever you're trying to say master Plo, just say it! I am suggesting, that perhaps, if you have train her well, she is  take care of herself. And find a way back, to you.

Betrayed and left for dead by Count Dooku. Asajj Ventress has begun a deadly game with his former master. Launching a secret assasination attempt againts him with the help of her kind, the misterious Nightsisters. Deceive in beliving the jedi are behind the recent attack. Dooku has travel across the galaxy to enlist the Nightsisters. In his quest for vengeance. Mother Talzin. Count Dooku, come. We have much to discuss. Thank you for receiving me, sister. I believe the old alliance can again be what it once was. You would only have to pledge your clan's allegiance to the separatists' cause. We could certainly use the powers of the Nightsisters against the jedi. Such a generous offer, count. But our loyalty is reserved for only each other. The only reason I am aiding in your search for a new assassin is because long ago, you chose to help me. After this matter is resolved, I hope our paths never cross again. As you wish, sister. Drink. You must gather your strength after such a long journey. Thank you. Blackroot, to replenish the body. You have heard of the sith warrior darth maul, have you not? Yes, he was slain on Naboo at the hand of Obi-Wan Kenobi. A few still remain in his bloodline. The men dwell on the far side of Dathomir. What if I could provide another of his kind? A warrior of the same caliber? Yes, but I warn you. Men are easy to acquire, hard to control. With my last assassin, Asajj Ventress, dead and the jedi's attacks against me increasing. Procuring a new personal assassin is essential. Very well. It shall be done, my Lord. So he has agreed to take another apprentice A barbarian, no less. A man we deliver to the count with all of the training and skill an assassin can possess. This warrior must have no loyalty to Dooku. He will be our pawn. Yes, yes. We will use our magicks to manipulate his assassin, and when the time is right Dooku will pay for his betrayal with his life. You will go to the far side of Dathomir and find the men. You will select the most suitable candidate, one with your strength and skill, one we can use to our advantage. Yes, mother. Ah, welcome, sister. I have come for the selection. Yes, yes, of course. Line up, heads of each tribe! Line up for the sister! Feral, try not to draw attention to yourself. That won't be a problem for me, Savage. What a fine-looking specimen. But looks aren't everything. Too small. Too weak. These will do. Him. And him. These men are to your liking, sister? Yes. Now for the tests. There will be three of them. Whoever survives will be my champion and go on to serve me. Understood? Yes, sister! Excellent! Let the games begin! We must be vigilant, feral. Aren't I always? Feral! Brother, get up. The witch. Where is she? Pathetic. Where are the warriors I came for? Is this is all the power these men possess? In order to fight against the force, you must see what cannot be seen. Only four of you remain. Who will be the first to fall? Not fast enough. Show yourself. Good. Let the third and final challenge begin. There are only two of us left, brother, but only one will survive. No, not if I can help it. Stick together. We must work as a team. Go! Savage! As long as I live, you will not harm him. Please, spare him. Take me. Leave us. My life is yours. Yes, it is. He has surrendered his life to me. This one is strong A perfect male specimen. Oh, such hate, the sheer power of it. A tremendous gift from the galaxy, mother. He will serve us well.

Bring in the prisoner. Now for the final test. Savage? Kill him. Savage, you know me. I am your kin. Do not do this. Whack! I said kill him. No! Brother! Brother, please! You beg? Weakling! Savage! Good. You will learn to draw your strength from your emotions. Hate will feed you. Never sympathize with the enemy, not even for a moment. Yes, sister. For you, an enchanted blade, blessed with our most potent magicks. I think it's time we introduce the apprentice to his new master. Wouldn't you agree? At last. Sister. Count Dooku. May I present Savage Opress. He certainly is a sight to behold. The fiercest of his kind, my Lord. He shall serve you well. Yes, he shall. Mother Talzin speaks very highly of your skills. Still, I require proof of your abilities as a warrior. The jedi are in control of a vital outpost on the jungle planet of Devaron, a temple. A temple? Do not be fooled, Savage. The temple of eedit serves only as a front for the mility operations of the Republic. It is essential that we seize the temple if the separatists ever hope to take control of that corner of the galaxy. You shall go to Devaron and take what is rightfully ours. Yes, my Lord. Get him! Jedi. Master? Stay back! No! My Lord. Is it finished? Yes. The temple has been taken. And the jedi? Dead. Very impressive, Savage. Return to Serenno immediately. Very well, my Lord. You have done well, Savage. I'll have much use for you. Thank you, my Lord. I foresee we will do great things together. I shall teach you the ways of the dark side. Soon your powers will rival that of the great sith Lord Darth Maul. We will be even more powerful than Lord Sidious. We shall rule the galaxy together, my apprentice. I am your servant, Master.   \n                "}, "A War on Two Fronts": {"episode": "s05e02", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tSeparatist takeover complete. Another Republic planet has fallen. Onderon has seceded to the Confederacy of Independent Systems under the rule of a new king. However, a small band of rebels have taken refuge deep within its vast and savage wilderness. From an abandoned outpost, they plot to take back the heavily fortified capital city of Iziz and end the Separatist occupation. Unfortunately, the only way to reclaim Onderon will be through armed struggle. But we lack sufficient hardware and supplies. Onderon is in your king's rule. And at the outbreak of the Clone War, he chose to align it with the Separatists. Our true king has been silenced. The one you recognize is a traitor and a Separatist minion. We need your help to survive this. Find a way we shall. We await your answer. There are pockets of rebels on many of these planets that just need guidance. With training and resources, they could attack soft targets while the Republic continues to engage them on the battlefield. That sounds like terrorism, Anakin. Well, I think of it as an insurgency to help realign these planets with the Republic. We can divide the Separatist forces and press them on two fronts. A means to an end fear cannot be. Stop those who spread terror the Jedi must. Indeed. What you're suggesting would open up dangerous possibilities. And we must not train terrorists. Eh, rebels. How we conduct war is what distinguishes us from others. Funding rebels to overthrow a legitimate government puts innocent lives at risk. We can minimize collateral damage by using arms that mainly affect droids. The least we can do is help them defend themselves, test the tactic while we're at it. This could be a great new weapon for us. Hmm. Train and observe. Send advisors we will. I'll assemble a team. I'm going with you. What, you don't trust me? Too much. That's what worries me. This is Valkyrie 2929. We're coming up on the drop zone. Go, go, go, go! We've spotted them, sir. Stay where you are. Identify yourselves. It's all right. We're friends. Jedi. I'm Commander Tano. We're here to help you take back your planet. My name is Steela. I'll guide you to our secret base. Hmm. A bit rough around the edges, wouldn't you say? That's why I brought Rex here. They're not exactly what I would call shinies, sir, but I could work with them. General Skywalker. At your service. This is General Kenobi, Commander Tano, and Captain Rex. We're looking forward to taking the fight to those scrappin' droids. Yes. All in good time. Saw. Saw Gerrera. He fashions himself as our leader, though no one elected him. Well, for now, we're in charge, and there is much to learn. The Separatists have strength in numbers. We're gonna show you how to target and destroy them. Now, to be clear, we are not here to fight your war; rather, to show you how to conduct it in the most efficient and successful way possible. Captain Rex. I'll show you how the 501st destroy clankers. First, I need volunteers to carry supplies from our entry point a half-klick west. Shouldn't be a problem. Excellent. Lux, it's good to see you again. It's good to see you too, Ahsoka. I didn't realize you had such strong ties to Onderon. Onderon is my home. My mother represented it in the Senate. Your voice is strong, like hers was. Have you reconsidered joining the Republic Senate? Even if we do take back Onderon, it won't change how I feel. I'm not fighting for the Republic. Well, what matters now is, we need each other's help, just like we did on Carlac. Carlac? What happened on Carlac? Ahsoka is the reason I'm here and not with Death Watch. Really? What he means is-- - She saved me from a huge mistake. Hmm. Lux obviously thinks highly of you. I guess so. Let's hope that respect is well founded. The pilot in the front hatch controls the tank, the shelves and the short range blasters. The commander in the top hatch controls the turret and the main cannon. You have to take out both chambers. Otherwise, the tank will remain operational. Everyone, divide up into teams of two, and we'll practice an assault on both hatches. I'll take the top. Let's see what you're made of, Bonteri. Ah! Sorry about that. You're a terrible soldier, Bonteri. I'm not sure if they're more interested in fighting the droids or each other. They'll learn. We just need time to train them properly. Keep your eyes on the quick learners. In this fight, time is not on our side. Go, go, go, go, go! An unscheduled ship entered the atmosphere in sector S-11 and failed to register. The rebels may be operating in that area. Check it out. Come on! Move it like a soldier, like a real soldier! Come on, Dono. Pick it up, Hutch. You can do better than that. Come on, hustle! I said hustle! That's what I'm talking about right there. Go, go, go! Good, good. You sure you're up for this? - Saw. - It was an accident. You would've had us both killed. Just stop it. Sit down, boy. This isn't the Senate. You've got no talent for this. It's going to take a lot more than muscle to defeat the Separatists. Politics have failed us. We have no choice. We always have a choice. Then make yours. Look, if we're going to succeed, you'll need to be exceptional with words and action. There will be time for both. Destroyers are quick, pack twin blasters, and come with their own shield generators. Nothing short of a cannon will pierce it. But they do have two weaknesses, and you will need to work together to exploit them. Beep! The shields deflect high-velocity attacks. What the shields don't stop are slow or stationary objects. They're designed to absorb them so nothing hinders their movement. Destroyers are blind from behind. A distraction combined with a rear assault will give you a kill. The trick is to get the right speed on the droid popper. Beep! These are unarmed. Just concentrate on getting it past the shield. Watch and learn. Quite brilliant. Hmm. Nice touch. Thanks. Not bad. Ugh! Be mindful of your frustration. It'll only hold you back. Here. Use your shoulder, let your arm swing, and keep your eyes on the target. Great. Okay, let's get back to work. Everyone pair up. We'll practice in groups. Hey, Commander, how about helping me practice? Roger, roger. This is command. Copy that. I'll send a squad out now. We've located the rebels. Proceed to sector S-29. Shoot to kill. I can't get the distance or the speed right. Don't give up. Learning this could save your life and those around you. A little backspin might help. Just take it easy. Don't get frustrated. You got it. You're a good teacher, Jedi. Ugh, just forget it. I'll never learn this. Uh, keep practicing. You made it look easy. It wasn't always that way. Right. The Force. That your secret? No. Perseverance. Look, you'll get the hang of it. I wouldn't let it get you down. I'm not feeling down. I just know what I'm good at. Impressive. Most impressive. Fixed targets are one thing. How about this? Nice job. You have clearly mastered your ability to focus. Snips, are you losing focus? - No, Master. - Good. A headshot is the only decisive way to disable a droid. They don't need arms, legs, or even bodies to pass intel to central command. All right, shoot at will. Wait a minute. What is that? Droids! Take cover! It appears the training is over. I'll take the left flank if you take the right. No, Anakin. We can only protect them. We cannot fight this war for them. There are too many. But Anakin, Ahsoka, and I can hold them off while you get your people out of here. You didn't teach us to run. Saw, use your disruptors to take out the droids. I'm on it. Ready disruptors. On my mark. Now! What is that? It looks like an explosive. How can you te-- Not bad. That is only the first wave. We'll handle this. No, I will. Duck! Ah! Hey, Bonteri, you ready to try again? Hey, what are you doing? What you taught us. Clang! Surrender, rebel. Uh You will answer for your crimes against the Separatist Alliance. We, uh, need to clean you up. I like it. Now you look more like a soldier than a politician. Well, maybe a good politician needs to get dirty now and then. Take confidence from this victory. But rest assured, there will be more droids coming now that they know your position. It doesn't matter. You're ready now. We are going to take the fight to the droids. You don't have to hide in the jungle any longer. Droids were a bit dim, more so than I imagined. They make up for it in numbers. They're designed to overwhelm. But they're not designed to deal with our approach. We hit them where they least expect it. And before they realize what happened-- We fade in with the rest of the population. Exactly. We need a plan to get inside the city. I have an idea. Identification please. Halt. What were you doing outside of the city gates? Hunting. We've been trekking for days. Did you register before your excursion? No, but most of our time is spent in the bush, collecting our traps. We come to the city to sell. You can't get thrip larva like this in Iziz. Only the biggest trees on the other side of Onderon. Hey, listen, we need to deliver all of this in time for supper. Hmm. Are you scanning anything? It's hard to tell with so much organic matter. Come on! Our merchants are waiting inside. Can you hurry it up? Let them through. Roger, roger. Good plan. Like Saw said, those droids are dumber than we thought. Not a bad start. But now the hard work begins. You must find recruits and choose your targets wisely. They'll be looking for us. We should split up. Regroup after nightfall. I'll alert our brothers. We'll make sure you have the supplies you need. Rex and I will take care of that. Good luck. You too. How do you think they'll do? I have a feeling we'll be pleasantly surprised. So you admit our new strategy will work? I am hopeful, Anakin, hopeful.   \n                "}, "Massacre": {"episode": "s04e19", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tSinister forces on the move. Asajj Ventress has suffered a humiliating betrayal at the hands of her own assassin, Savage Opress. Having gone into hiding, she now has no choice but to seek sanctuary with the Nightsisters of Dathomir. Sister, I knew you'd return. I've been hiding. Reevaluating. I suspected as much. Savage, that monster we created, has forsaken us. He refused my guidance and escaped into the galaxy. I have nothing. You have your breath, your skill, and your sisters. You have everything needed to survive. You must give up the ways of the Sith and return to our fold. You will leave Dooku's absurd war behind and remain with us. No longer to be ordered about. You will be loyal to no one but your sisters, and yourself. And then? And then, you will fulfill your destiny and become a true Nightsister. You summoned me, My Lord?

I am privileged to be your sister. Thank you, Karis. Droid fighters. Scatter! Prepare yourselves, sisters! The war has come to Dathomir. Establish a perimeter and get the droids in attack formation. We'll burn a path through the forest right to their fortress. Gather your weapons! The droid army is only here because of me. And so many are going to die. There is no time for regret. Now we must fight. That gutless coward, Grievous, is coordinating the attack. I can sense it. You know the droids. It gives us an advantage. Karis! Go and lead us to victory. We will need an army to fight Grievous. I will speak with Old Daka. She will get us the reinforcements we need. Follow me, sisters. Attack! Take to the trees, sisters. We shall attack the droids from above and below. Sir, there is heavy fighting along the eastern front. Reports indicate Ventress is leading the attack. Send in the Defoliator tank. We'll burn those witches to the ground. Go to my chamber. There you will find a small metallic sphere. Bring it to the hidden cave. Yes, Mother. Daka, as the oldest and wisest of us, I need you to resurrect our fallen sisters. Ventress will need the aid of the undead army to achieve victory. Then I will begin the chant of resurrection. Rise. Rise. Awake, dead sisters. Rise. Rise. Rise. Awake, dead sisters. Rise. Fire the Defoliator. Roger, roger. The army of the dead, her reinforcements. The undead will clear us a path right to Grievous. Ventress has her army now. Good. Now I can deal with Count Dooku. We found it, Mother. Here is the orb you requested. Well done. Ah, here it is. A single lock of Count Dooku's silver hair. He should be more careful than making deals with witches. Now for Dooku. Mother Talzin. Surprised? Hardly. You're the one I was sent here for. Then fight me alone. Prove you're the greater warrior. If I win, your army leaves. If you win, the Nightsisters will surrender to you. I have always been greater than you. Pain, Count Dooku. You will know terrible pain. Enough of this. You think you can defeat me? You're nothing. Kill her. Doom is upon us, sister. Run. Save yourself. Grievous, you must stop Mother Talzin before she kills me. Follow the witch's magic. It appears as a green mist. Follow it to its source. And eliminate Talzin. Quickly! Forget Ventress! Our new target is Mother Talzin. Follow me. Call off your army and leave Dathomir at once. And let you and that traitor continue plotting against me? Never! You're going to die either way. It's only a matter of how painful it will be. Fire! No! General! It is over, sister. No one remains? This is all my fault. Where do I go? What do I do? This chapter is over. Your destiny will always be linked with ours. But you have your own path to follow now. No! Wait!

My hatred kept my spirit intact even though my body was not. Yet I was lost and became a rabid animal and such is how you found me, brother. Discarded, forgotten. I have missed so much. The Force feels out of balance. Yes. There is conflict. The Clone Wars. Oh, yes. So it began without me. You can begin again, brother. I was apprentice to the most powerful being in the galaxy once. I was destined to become so much more, but I was robbed of that destiny by the Jedi, by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Then you must have your revenge, my brother. Yes, we shall start with revenge. The supply ship's here. Go on ahead. Brother, what are we doing here? The Jedi won't be out this far in the galaxy. In a galaxy at war, Savage, there is only one way to get the attention of the Jedi. Slaughter of the innocent, mercilessly and without compromise. There will be more innocent blood on your hands, Kenobi, unless you come here, face me. Come alone and if you do not, this world will burn. I have to go. Not alone you're not. We'll send a task force with you. No, you see what he's capable of. He's a broken, unbalanced monster. I've dealt with him before. I can do it again. I disagree. This is clearly a trap. Against my better judgment, agree with Master Kenobi, I do. Finish what he started long ago, Obi-Wan must. I'm off to Raydonia. Master Yoda, if this is indeed Darth Maul, his capture is far too important to leave it to Obi-Wan alone. Mmm. Not alone will Kenobi be, an unexpected ally he may have.

Still as weak as ever. And they call you, \"Master.\" You know, when I cut you in half, I should have aimed for your neck instead. Anything more to say? I like your new legs. They make you look taller. I will make sure you stay awake long enough to feel every single cut. Your death will be beyond excruciating. You will suffer as I have suffered! What a surprise. My former servant, still an animal. And you have a friend now. My brother. A brother? Looks like he's half the man you are, Savage. How unfortunate. I was looking for a challenge, not some wretched castoffs from the Nightbrothers clan. What a disappointment. Who is this, brother? A Dathomir witch. She betrayed me. She knows too much, destroy her. Kenobi, don't tell me someone's finally knocked the fight out of you. Wake up! Ventress? It looks like I'm here to rescue you. When did you become the good guy? Don't insult me. Oh! What a lovely sight to wake up to. Don't flatter yourself, Kenobi, you've never been much to look at, especially now. The witch and the Jedi. Here for our taking. I want that back. That's fine, red's not my color. Ready? Like you even have to ask. Ventress, catch! Your master, Qui-Gon Jinn, I gutted him while you stood helpless and watched. How did that make you feel, Obi-Wan? Your rage has unbalanced you. That is not the Jedi way, is it? - We're outmatched. - You want to run? I learned from watching you. Funny. The cockpit? Now!

Ion has just brought word from Pantora that things are far Worse than we've been led to Believe. The people are restless. The trade federation blockade is Causing far more damage and Disorder than we predicted. We need more time. The senate will vote in our Favor, I'm sure of it. Count Dooku and the Separatists are promising Immediate aid and a resolution To the blockade. You're not suggesting we Join them, are you? Certainly not. I merely point out that the Wheels of democracy are moving Too slowly. There are Pantorans rallying For us to leave the republic And join the separatists. We cannot give up on the Republic senate. Chairman, you must convince the People to remain loyal to our Cause. I will do what I can, Senator. What's wrong with the lights? Did you see that? It's nothing. Just the shadows playing tricks. Don't tell me You're afraid of the dark. Chi? Chi? Stop fooling around. My father's a powerful man. If you hurt me or my sister, You'll be dead. Big talk. You're coming with us. Smack! Hurry. Let's go. I don't like the situation On Pantora one bit. It reminds me far too much Of naboo's own scarred history. Well, that blockade Wasn't that bad. It's the reason I met you, After all. You certainly have a unique way Of looking at things, ani. Senator Amidala. Master skywalker. What is it, ahsoka? Someone has kidnapped Chairman Papanoida's daughters. I was afraid something like This would happen. Anakin? The jedi can't ket involved. This is a job for the local Police. I'm not so sure local Authorities can handle it. The separatists are putting A lot of pressure on Pantora To join them. I'm afraid this blockade may Give the Pantorans no other Choice. Master, if the jedi can't Officially get involved, let me Do this on my own. Senator Chuchi is a good friend Of mine. All right, with the Separatists involved, I guess it Gives you cause to investigate. Go help senator Chuchi, but Don't get in the way of the Local authorities. Aren't you going to help? I said the situation gives You cause to investigate, Not us. I need to go back to the jedi Temple and make sure the council Doesn't find out about your Little expedition. Should you really proceed Without the council's approval? We do it all the time, Don't we, snips? Yep. Well, be careful, ahsoka. I still can't believe They let you teach. Give your father My condolences. If you want your sisters back, We're here to help. Father, count Dooku Has offered to help us find Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe. Chuchi, senator Amidala sent Me to help if I can. Chairman Papanoida. This is my good friend Ahsoka. Good. A jedi can always be of help. Senator Amidala thinks This may have something to do With the separatists. They've already made contact With us. I don't think this is A kidnapping. I think they're holding them Hostage. A not very subtle attempt to Get us to join the separatists? If the separatists are Involved, your daughters may be Held on the trade federation Ship blockading your planet. That is a possibility. Why don't you and Chuchi pay Them a diplomatic visit and see What you can find out. We'll stay here and follow the Police investigation. Did you find anything? We've completed a thorough Sweep of your apartment, Chairman. No evidence of foul play. My daughters' lives Are in your hands, inspector. You have nothing to worry About, your honor. We are in complete control Of the situation. That inspector is useless. Somewhere. Look here. The icon of the moon goddess. It should be up on the shrine With the others. Wait a minute. What's this? Blood. It must be what they used To fight off their attackers. But the kidnappers didn't know To put it back In the right place. Information retrieval. I need you to match This blood sample against Known galactic criminals. Ding! A rodian. It says here his name's Greedo. Looks like he's based on Tatooine. Then what are we waiting for? Senator Chuchi, To what do we owe this pleasure? I bring word from The chairman of Pantora. The chairman has finally Decided to agree to our terms? Not exactly. The chairman wanted to inform You of an impending alliance Between Pantora And the confederacy Of independent systems. The chairman is planning to Join the separatist alliance? If that were the case, Would you remove your blockade Of Pantora? If that were the case, The chairman would have to go To the senate And renounce the republic. Then we could discuss how Quickly we can resume commerce. Very well. I shall contact the chairman. We can discuss the finer details Of the terms later this evening. Agreed. Now you and your servant may Stay as our honored guests. Come this way to your rooms. Be careful, Ion. The hutts are the only law That matters on Tatooine. I don't scare easily. Smack! Rotta! Na hagwa do yafulkee! Where do we start? We'll have to get a feel For the crowd. Ta-Bai-A-Lo. Shouldn't we talk to jabba No. Remember, we're not sure who's Behind this kidnapping yet. Jabba could be involved. What if Greedo runs? We'll let Greedo know We're here. That way, he'll come to us. How are we gonna do that? Follow me. Nio rella ri eeta. Ota, ota. Ladies, Do any of you know Greedo? Who's asking? We're asking. We're looking to hire A bounty hunter. He's not here. But if he comes back, I'll tell him You were asking for him. Patience. If she won't lead us to Greedo, She'll lead Greedo to us. This is the ambassador's Office. Maybe we'll find something here. The separatists are still Recovering from their defeat They're coming. Hide. Whoosh! We need to know Who our supporters are. I understand your profit Margins with the separatists Can be considerable, however, I object to the kidnapping. The chairman's children Are leverage. Besides, they're well Taken care of. Yes, but why on my ship? What was that? Are you certain we're alone? I'm sure I heard something. All of this scheming With the separatists Is making you paranoid. Do not worry. The daughters Are not to be harmed At least for now. You see? The trade federation Is behind the kidnapping. Let's find The detention area. Come on. Poodoo! Greedo, baby, there you are. Smooch! There's some men here Looking for you. Pantorans. They must have found Some evidence. We'll have to settle things More permanently. Have you done this before? No, but I've been practicing. The detention block Is closed to visitors. Move along. You will let me pass. I will let you pass. I'm sorry, the detention block Is closed to visitors. Ahsoka. Ugh. You will let us both pass. I I will let you both pass. Looking for someone, Chairman? I was looking for you, Greedo. Tell me where my daughters are Or die. You were a fool to come here. Let's dispose of them outside. I don't want to die On this dust ball. We won't have to. Shing! Hey! Click! Clunk! We're going to talk to jabba About this. This is the fifth area We've checked, And there's no sign Can't you sense Where they are? Isn't that something You jedi can do? It's not something I can just turn on or off. We'll just have to Keep looking. Sir, we have intruders In the detention area. It looks like our guests Got a little too curious For their own good. Cheekopo wokinaga meewonka Cojo wooshanee. Chairman Papanoida, The mighty jabba wishes to know Why you tried to kill One of his bounty hunters. Great jabba, my daughters Have been kidnapped. As a father yourself, I know you understand That I will do anything To get them back safely. I have evidence that Greedo Is responsible which means That either you are behind it Or Greedo Is working for someone else. Since we are friends, jabba, I know you would never Do such a thing. No! No! He's lying! Chi Sa Greedo. We found blood At the scene of the crime. If it matches Greedo's, It will prove He is the kidnapper. Cootoo bagand bagwa. Jabba will allow a blood Sample to be taken. Wait, wait, no! It's all lies! Nobacca bagand! Okay, okay. I kidnapped them. The separatists wanted leverage Against you. Where are they, you slime? One of them is here At mos eisley. She's safe, I assure you. Let's hope she's in this one. Senator Chuchi, How did you find me? It's a long story. Where's your sister? I don't know. We were separated. All right, Sleemo, no tricks. We're gonna go inside Nice and easy. You think they will just hand Her over to you? No, but I'll bet They'll hand her over to you. Go get the prisoner. Greedo, What are you doing here? There's been a change Of plans. We're going to have to Move the prisoner. On whose orders? Gunray. He contacted me At jabba's palace. Why'd he contact you? And who are those two? They're emissaries Of the trade federation. Trade federation? They don't look like Trade federation to me. Pat! Father! Father? They're Pantorans! Blast them! Stop them! Smash! Surrender, separatist! What is the meaning of this? You've been holding the Chairman of Pantora's daughter As a hostage. What? Sib cannay, what is she talking About? I want my litigator. We are businessmen! We deal in trade and commerce! Yes, but perhaps your Business is war profiteering. How dare you! I dare because you claim to Have no involvement, and yet Here stands the chairman's Daughter on your ship, Held by your administrator. I may understand your position, But I doubt the rest of the Senate will. Blackmail. No, business. I could, of course, be persuaded To defend your unfortunate Circumstances to the senate, That is, if this blockade ended. I'll see what I can do. It has come to our attention That the ugly head of the Separatist has once again Raised itself in the ranks of Our very own trade federation. Nute gunray's influence Extends farther than we ever Imagined. It was sib cannay acting on his Own accord who kidnapped the Children of chairman Papanoida. In good faith, We have returned them to him. And also as A gesture of friendship, We are removing our blockade And reopening trade With the Pantorans.   \n                "}, "Kidnapped": {"episode": "s04e11", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA planet of peace! The artisan colony of the planet Kiros created a society without weapons. Instead of war, they pursued art and beauty. But in the Clone Wars, even peace-loving worlds are seemingly forced to change sides. The simple truth is there is not a warrior among us, Master Yoda. An armed conflict will destroy us. We will negotiate with Count Dooku if we are able. Trust Dooku, you cannot. Send help, I will. I'm afraid it is too late. The Separatists have already arrived. Count Dooku, we have chosen to remain neutral in this war. Why have you launched this invasion against us? Think of our presence as a peaceful occupation for your protection as well as ours. I have heard the tragic stories of worlds caught between your droids and their clones. What of my people? While I am helpless to prevent the fighting, I can offer your people sanctuary. A safe haven until the conflict has ended. Thank you, Count, yours is a kind offer, but I insist. Round up the citizens. All of them. Roger roger. - Unhand me. - Watch it. - Hey! Let me go! - Hey! Watch it! I said let me go! All clear, sir. There are no Separatist craft in the system. It's been 10 rotations since Master Yoda's transmission. I just hope we're not too late. - Rex. Take us down. - Yes, sir. Anybody else think it's too quiet? I haven't seen any colonists. - They're probably hiding. - Let's hope they stay hidden. It makes our job easier if we don't have to worry about them in battle. I don't like it. The clankers have never been shy about using civvies as living shields. I'm sure they're here somewhere. Let's make for the city center. Biker droids dead ahead! Squad, tighten up! Form on me! We're all clear, Master. Captain, have your men secure the area. How are we doing, Boil? We're still mopping up clankers here and there, sir. We've established a perimeter around the Governor's Tower. - No one gets out without a fight. - Good work. Cody, any word from the Separatist commander? He's barricaded inside. His name is Darts D'Nar. He sent you a message, sir. Master Kenobi, come to the tower. We will negotiate terms for surrender. Well, that was easy. Zygerrian scum. I'll handle that slaver. Anakin, he asked for me. I need you to locate the missing Togruta colonists. Fine. I'll have Admiral Yularen initiate a planetary bio-scan. Why is he so upset? Anakin has never talked about his past, has he? Only to tell me he won't talk about it. As a child, Anakin and his mother were sold into slavery by the Hutt clans. Oh. And these Zygerrians, they're slavers? Anakin has struggled to put his past behind him. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him. Yes, make sure you do. The last shipment has been received, D'Nar. I understand the Jedi have attacked. Why are you still there? I'm going to make the Jedi pay for their arrogance. I have them right where I want them. Do tell. Gentlemen, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight. D'Nar, bring him to me on his knees. With pleasure. We were going to discuss surrender? Yes. You will surrender. We obviously have a misunderstanding, my friend. No, you are wrong, Jedi. Am I? You are no doubt aware your droid forces have been destroyed, and you are surrounded. Do the honorable thing and give up now, D'Nar. I promise you will receive fair treatment. You've broken through my defenses. You think you've won? Think again. I have planted bombs all over the city. No one will survive. Now, surrender. If you're not bluffing, then I must concede. But you'll have to make considerations. First, you release the colonists. Here is my counter-offer. There were no colonists in that structure, but there could have been. Now, bow down and surrender to me, you Jedi filth. I need a medic over here! Artoo, where are you? Watch yourself, buddy. This is still a war zone. Cody! We don't have time for the planetary scan. - Hook Artoo up, and he'll locate the bombs. - Right away, sir! - Ahsoka, let's go. - Where are we going? To disarm the bombs while Obi-Wan negotiates. I hope he can buy us some time. Very well, I surrender. Long before this war, you Jedi destroyed the great Zygerrian Slave Empire. I would kill you now, but Dooku would prefer you alive. I understand your frustration. It is unfortunate you and I cannot resolve our differences as you do in the Zygerrian tradition. With no weapons, you would fight me? For good reason. Say, if I win, you reveal the location of the colonists and the bombs. And if I win, I deliver you to Dooku in a cage like one of these filthy creatures. Perhaps. Careful, you're disturbing my pets. They fetch a high price. General Skywalker! Your droid is transmitting the bomb coordinates now. Copy that, Cody. We're approaching the first bomb now. Let's go! Do you hear that? There must be a wire we should cut or something to stop the countdown. Stand back. Ah! - How did you know that would work? - I trusted my instincts. You mean you guessed. Yeah, but it was an educated guess. Now, come on. There's plenty more to go. For thousands of years, Zygerria supplied slave labor to the galaxy. We prospered. Our customers prospered. Then the Jedi came. - Excuse me, sir. We have a problem. - What problem? Our spotters are tracking two enemy walkers moving through These are the last of them. Defuse the bombs! I'll cover you! Master, I think the bombs are linked. You're supposed to disarm them, not activate them! Droids on the roof! If they're connected, we'll have to defuse them at the same time. Snipers! Their shields are too strong! Come on, Anakin. Hurry up. I'm pinned down! Master, we're running out of time! I know. We have to do something and quick! Ahsoka, they're weak from the side. I've got an angle on your droid. Okay. I've got a view of yours too. Same time. Ready? Go! - That was a close one. - Let's hope Obi-Wan shares our luck. Now I'll take revenge for my people, Jedi. Sir, you have an urgent transmission. Sorry to interrupt, sir, but you weren't responding. What is it? Uh The Jedi have disarmed your bombs. What? Give me the detonator! Certainly took him long enough this time. Well, shall we discuss your surrender? Again? I still have one bomb left, Jedi. Sir, how could you? No! No! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Anakin! Anakin, come in. D'Nar is making his escape from the tower. On our way! - We'll never catch him in time. - I am not letting that slaver scum get away. - So, what's your plan? - I'm open to ideas. Hungry, my pet? I'll feed you! Hold on! \"Hold on\"? Do I have a choice? - Master! - Ahsoka, you're only making it angry! I'll handle this. Go stabilize the ship. Young Jedi, you'll learn your place. I'm not so young anymore. Gotcha. Mission accomplished, Master. Where are the colonists? I will tell you nothing. Where are they? Master. My queen is going to bring back the royal slave auction as in the days before the Jedi. Zygerria will be rich and powerful again. The Jedi will not stop us this time. We'll see about that. General Skywalker, I ran the bio-scan twice, but the results were negative. Are you saying the colonists are not in the city? I'm saying they're not even on the planet. The entire population appears to have simply vanished. Vanished? That's impossible. Those are my people. Troubling is the return of the Zygerrians. It is likely they mean to use Dooku to rebuild their slaver empire. We cannot allow that, Master. Agree I do, but first find the colonists you must. In great danger, they are. What is it, Master? Sense I do a darker hand in this mystery. Slavery, a great tool it is for the rise of the Sith.   \n                "}, "Duchess of Mandalore": {"episode": "s02e14", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA diplomatic mission! As dissent threatens to tear Apart the peaceful Mandalore system, Duchess Satine struggles To protect her people against The escalating violence. Betrayed by two of her Trusted allies, Satine now travels To Coruscant. There, she hopes To convince the senate That a destructive Splinter group, Death watch, Does not represent The entire Mandalorian government. With your death watch army In place, Now all we need do Is to sit and wait. But for how long? My men are anxious to fight. Considering the plot We've just set in motion, I assure you, the republic Will oblige you the fight You're looking for. First, send a death watch Assassin to Coruscant. The duchess of Mandalore Must die. Prime minister. You found The death watch armies, then? Yes, sir. They are preparing for battle. But if they attack, It would strengthen The people's resolve Not to join The death watch movement. The death watch Will never be strong enough To take over Mandalore Without the will of the people. Not if the republic Has a military presence here. Their occupation will turn The death watch from terrorists To liberators in the eyes Of the people. But how can we Stop the republic From coming here? Our fate now lies In the hands of duchess Satine. It grieves me to say it, But death watch is now A significant, deadly threat. Mandalore is making Great strides To find the leaders Of this terrorist movement. They are not powerful enough To destabilize our government. We will resolve this Without conflict. If the republic gets involved In our affairs, It will only lead To further violence. Thus, I shall reassert Our position of neutrality. Talk of an idealist. No, those are the words Of a pacifist And a people who have chosen Nonviolent action. That may be so, duchess. However, this message Was delivered to my staff Just this morning. I think you shall find it Most illuminating. The actions By our government Have taken us into a period Of civil war. To acknowledge it Would be to invite panic In the streets. Duchess? Yes. Deputy minister jerec. He's a dear friend. It is more than Mere possibility, More than eventuality. It is here. Stop! Deputy minister jerec Is an honorable man. He would never commit such lies To the record. The Mandalorian government Holds no secrets From its people. If only that were true. Beep! Death watch is far stronger Than we once thought. If we are to combat them Effectively, We must have Republic assistance. Instead, this government Acts out of pride And rejects the help Of the jedi. It's not true. It's not true! The duchess Satine Will ultimately cause Our defeat. Make no mistake. Republic intervention Is absolutely necessary. This isn't right. Something here isn't right. I wish to speak To jerec immediately. Sadly, deputy minister jerec Perished this morning In a death watch bombing On kalevala. Let us ensure that his death Was not in vain. Let us commit Our military might to defending The Mandalorian people. Defending? You mean to occupy our home. You would trample our right To self-determination. We mean to save your people. You will turn our planet Into a military target, Which will bring the war to us. Mandalore must remain A neutral system. The vote shall commence In the next session. Duchess! Satine, wait. I just heard What happened in the senate. You're sweet To be concerned, But I promise, I'll be all right. I am concerned. We're friends, are we not? Yes, friends And nothing more. Satine, As your friend, I don't think you should make Any decisions in this State of mind. This state of mind? And what state of mind Would that be, precisely? What I'm saying is, Any person would be hysterical By now, but Hysterical? The republic is attempting To force its will Upon innocent people. I only meant that Frankly, I'm surprised You're not hysterical. Perhaps if more citizens Got hysterical, They'd be more inclined To speak up when the republic Tramples on their rights. Rushing in like this, It's It's foolhardy. Ironic words from a man Who spends his days Running hither and yon, Wielding his lightsaber With deadly force As if on a crusade. Why should I listen to someone Who so frequently Relies on violence? In my opinion, You're the one who's foolhardy. What's happening? It's the navigation system. Get her out of here. There's a platform ahead. I'll try to get closer. No, stop! Aramis! Jump! What do you mean, No charges are to be filed? None at all? Someone tried to kill me. The controls on my speeder Were compromised. Sadly, my dear, There is no proof Anyone tampered with anything. I'm afraid it might've been Just an accident. An accident? And it just happened to coincide With me defending my home world? I agree with Satine. Well, finally. It proves what I've Been saying all along. Death watch is out of control. The republic must step in And help. No, wait. I didn't You can't keep them Reined in, obviously. So we will. This is patently offensive. You can't do this. Unfortunately, It's up to the senate now. I'm sure they'll make a reasoned And thoughtful decision. Satine, I just heard About your accident. This government will Satine, Tell me what happened. I'm fine. I wasn't hurt. I didn't want to worry you. Well, I'afraid, On that count, You've failed spectacularly. Look what happened. Look what happened? This attack proves I've upset someone. I must be on the right track. This attack proves Your enemies are here Even on Coruscant. You're not going to let Republic authorities Handle this, are you? You're not backing down. Republic authorities? Certainly not. I'm on my way To the ministry of intelligence Right now to meet my contact. Don't you see? You need your friends with you, Not held at arm's length. In your quest to be Self-reliant, Have you decided To cut your friends Out of your life? I I don't know. Senator, what is it? The senate Completed its vote. They've decided In favor of occupation. When did this happen? The vote was supposed To be tomorrow. It was during your meeting With the chancellor. Your accident accelerated The senate's decision. Republic forces are set to leave For Mandalore At sunrise tomorrow. You see? I was right before. Counting on the republic Is a mistake. I don't have much time. They're following me. You've put yourself In great danger. I will never forget it. I had to come. This is worth it. Where did you get this? Buried deep In the evidence facility At the ministry. It was not easy to find, Believe me. You were right. Someone faked the evidence. The recording Presented to the senate Was not the full recording, But this disc is. You must show the senate. Davu! No. We have a shooting In sector gl-5. Subject identified As duchess Satine kryze. Hands where we can see them. You are coming with us. I didn't kill him. Subject identified We spotted her. She's heading into the alley. Oop, cancel that. She's escaping in a speeder, Heading for section 1-g-44. Duchess Satine escaped again, But I took out an informant. Not sure if he successfully Delivered something to her, But it looked like a handoff. Find her. Whatever she's carrying May compromise our plan. My lord, Everything is going As you instructed. Death watch Yes. The people have been Worked into such a frenzy That when the republic Does arrive, The death watch Will be considered heroes. Excellent. The republic occupation force Is loading their ships And will arrive on time, If the duchess Satine Does not get in the way. The duchess Satine Will not be in the way Much longer. One of the death watch assassins Is taking care of her. Excuse me, sir. If you see this woman, Report her to The local authorities. You know, I don't think he understands us. Let's try someone else. Obi-wan, come in. Obi-wan, are you there? Satine, where are you? Mas amedda has demanded You turn yourself in. I know. Listen to me. Obi-wan, I need your help. Have you seen this woman? Nice disguise. Seeing you all right is Well, it's a relief. You should turn yourself in. We've both sworn A loyalty to the republic. Believe me, Neither one of us Is breaking our oath. And this will prove it. I need to get it Into the proper hands. But the republic guards Are hunting you, Which means Whoever doctored This recording is likely In the government itself. If you set foot Inside the senate, They'll take you. And the disc Will be destroyed Before anyone can see it, Which is why you must Take the disc to Padme. Blast it. Where will you be While I'm in the senate? What if they find you? They won't. I'm going to surrender to them. What? You'll need a distraction To enter the senate freely. I can't risk them searching you Just because you and I Are associates. I'm a jedi. They wouldn't dare. Things are changing, my dear. Excuse me. I believe you are looking for me. The occupation of Mandalore Will usher in a new level Of security for the republic And its fight Against corruption. If there are no objections Supreme chancellor, There has been a development Mandalore's neutrality. The chair recognizes The senator from naboo. I think this should cast A new light on the so-called Evidence we saw earlier. The actions by our government Have taken us into a period Of civil war. To acknowledge it Would be to invite Panic in the streets. Death watch is far stronger Than we once thought. But we have been Training for this. We can stop them. But if we are to combat them Effectively, We must have the temerity To stand strong In the name of peace. And if we are to do so, We must reject Any republic assistance. Instead, this government Will act. It acts not out of pride But for safety. Intervention by the republic Will inflame the opposition. And this is why our government Rejects the help of the jedi. We must listen To the duchess Satine. If we do not, We will ultimately cause Our defeat. All troops will stand down. All troops will stand down. Unacceptable! You promised us We would reclaim Mandalore From these weak-willed cowards. I will order my men to attack. And if you do, You'll hold the planet For perhaps a day. Without the backing Of my forces Or your people, Your revolution will be over Before it begins. A neophyte such as you Wouldn't know these things, But I do. I have other ways To accomplish our goals. Thankfully, With the revelation Of this new information, The occupation of Mandalore Is no longer necessary. The person to thank Is duchess Satine. She found the proof. I require no thanks. Satine. The senate held An emergency session, And republic forces Have been ordered to stand down. Allow me to offer A most sincere apology On behalf Of the entire republic. You are a most loyal servant, And we are all grateful. Yes, grateful. Chancellor, If you and mas amedda Would join me for a moment, We have some logistics To discuss in order to ratify The senate's decision. But for you, This wouldn't have happened. No, it was your Unshakable faith in your people And your determination That brought about this result. I appreciate that. But still, who is behind All of this? Who tampered With that recording? Who tried to convict me Of murder and throw me in jail? I'm not sure. But as you said yourself, Things are changing.

Our generals inform us that troops in the field continue to perform valiantly. What we cannot afford, is to be irresponsible. The Republic is near bankruptcy due to the cost of this war. Bankruptcy is not necessary, my friends. If we pass senator Saam's bill to open new lines of credit, We will gain access to the needed funds. Won't this bill essentially deregulate the banks?

That legislation would have meant billions for us. I tried my best To push the bill through. You did your part, representative. Senator Amidala is the problem. I thought age might temper her idealism. I know people who could do something about her. That task is more difficult than you presume. Gentlemen, the banking clan and trade federation Are about business, not violence. Hmm, in this case, our business is violence. Precisely. With or without senator Amidala, the galactic senate Is unlikely to deregulate The banks. until this war hits home. What exactly are you proposing?

You must ask the jedi council To speak with chancellor Palpatine. Don't involve me in this. A peaceful solution ls the only way out of this morass of war. That's not my role, Padme. Why not? Why isn't it your role? Aren't we jedi knights? Isn't it our duty to speak our minds to advise the chancellor? Uh, I suggest you teach my young padawan A thing or two about politics. After today's debate, I was hoping she learned a great deal. Truthfully, I don't understand any of it. I know the separatists are evil, But all anyone argued about was banking deregulation, lnterest rates, and, well, Almost nothing about why We're fighting in the first Place. War's complicated, Ahsoka. But let me simplify it. The separatists believe the Republic is corrupt, But they're wrong, and we have to restore order. Maybe talking to the jedi council isn't the role for you after all. Thanks for your help. Come on, Ahsoka. Hey. You told me to teach her about politics. So I'm going to. There is a problematic situation brewing in the senate. We must insure that everything my master has set in motion Does not unhinge. My representatives ln the Republic are relying on you, general. See that your droids complete their mission. But of course, Count. They will not fail. If only I could talk to senator Bonteri. Who's he? He is a she, a senator in the confederacy Of independent systems. Your friend is a separatist? One of Dooku's pawns? The separatists used to be a part of the Republic. I was close with many of the senators who left. I may not agree with them, but they're more than pawns. If you think negotiating is the right thing to do, Let's talk to her. The senate's made it illegal. Illegal? They say official meetings would only legitimize The separatists. Well, master Skywalke and I hold what we call aggressive negotiations all the time. It's a shame you can't hold more peaceful talks When you want. You just gave me an idea. You're a jedi, which gives you special clearance. Right. And jedi are allowed to travel to neutral worlds like Mandalore, Where we could then board A cargo ship to a separatist System. Are you suggesting I use my status as a jedi To smuggle you behind Enemy lines? It's just that you could get Us through to meet with her And I haven't seen her Or her family in so long. Relax. I'll help you. Besides, master Skywalke Said you should teach me About politics. Right. You know, you two have more ln common than you think. It's no wonder you get along Well. Huh. Of course. So where are we heading? Raxus. Have all the preparations Been made? I'm about to deploy The infiltrators. You must hurry. The senate is restless. I don't take orders from you, only count Dooku. You have been designed for this mission to be the ultimate infiltration units. Some of you may not return. Actually, none of you Will return. But don't let that get ln your way. Is that clear? Get them to Coruscant. Roger, roger. Move along, please. Move along. Identification, please. Excuse me. Is this platform b? Uh, platform b this way. Hello, old friend. Ahsoka, this is Miina Bonteri. She was my mentor when I was growing up on Naboo. You're a separatist? Well, of course, my dear. What were you expecting? Now, come. I have a transport waiting. Lux, come down here and help our guests With their luggage, please. Padme, it's so good to see you. Yes. How things have changed since the last time we met. Let's go inside. There's much to discuss. Please, allow me. May I? I can handle it. He's grown so much, Miina. Time won't stop, even if we are at war. And I'm afraid tse events Are shaping his young life. With all due respect, As a separatist, Didn't you create this war? Ahsoka! It's all right. That's a very polarized point of view, my dear. Would it surprise you to know that many of the people You call separatists feel the same way about the Republic And the jedi? Lux's father was like that. Maybe I could speak with him. If only you could. A year ago next week, he was setting up a base on Aargonar when clones attacked. My husband fought bravely in self-defense, but was killed. Excuse me. I think I'll get some air. Ah, the cleaning droids. Finally. Don't waste any time. Get to work. You're a jedi, aren't you? Yes. Why do you ask? Before the war, I was always told jedi were good. And now? I don't know anymore. There are lot of terrible things happening, a lot of killing. And now my friends are saying the jedi are to blame. I'm the first jedi you've ever met, aren't I? Well, um Yes. Look at me. I'm not so bad, am I? No, not bad at all. Uh. Well, it seems boys are the same whether they're Republic Or separatist. Wait. How many separatists have you met? What? Well, I mean, you think we're all the bad guys. But how many of us have you actually met? And droids don't count. Well, other than military officers like Grievous and Ventress, None, I guess. You and your mother are the first. Well, look at me. Am I so bad? I sense Dooku's dirty hand ln all of this. He's just the leader of the senate. He's not the leader of the entire universe. Oh, I forgot. You actually admire the man. We'll never entirely agree on Dooku, my old friend, But we can agree on the need to stop this war. The question is how. That is why it was so urgent that I speak with you. The Republic senate is holding a critical vote on whether or not to escalate the war effort. However, many of the delegates are undecided as to what to do. How interesting. You would find the separatist parliament in a similar dilemma. I am certain if you could convince your representatives to extend an olive branch of peace towards the Republic, there might be enough sympathy ln the senate to finally open negotiations. I admire your spirit, Padme. I can at least put the motion on the floor. Thank you, Miina. That's all I ask. To peace, then. To hope. How many lives on both sides have to end before we see the futility? Surely there's room in the galaxy for confederate and Republic planets to coexist. I move that we immediately open peace negotiations with chancellor palpatine on Coruscant. The corporate alliance will never allow this to happen. This is a democracy, and unlike the Republic, corporations do not rule us. Nay! Quiet. In accordance with the bylaws of independent systems, a voice vote is required. All in favor of initiating peace negotiations with the galactic Republic, say aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. All those opposed. Nay. Nay. The ayes have it. This is quite troubling, your own senate voting to end the war. I assure you, gentlemen, your worries are gravely exaggerated. How can you be sure this groundswell of peace won't continue? Where is the attack we were promised? We need fighting to feed the machine and our profits. After our attack, the chances of peace will disappear. The banking clan, the trade federation, and the techno union will all get their fair share and then some. Well, this is good-bye. I've been disappointed before, and yet, I almost feel as if this time the tide has turned in the war. You should hurry. Goody-bye, young one. You really believe the Republic will vote for peace? I hope so. I wouldn't want to meet you on the battlefield, for your sake. Go, you two, quickly. Team leaders, come in. Commence phase two. All right, everybody have your passes out. Hmm, generator maintenance, eh? Yeah, well, everything checks out. Good luck down there. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Power generators are that way. Stupid droids. Well, well, well. This is quite a stunning development. Your excellency, we would be remiss, if not irresponsible, to reject the separatists proposal. Of course. An end to the fighting, would mean there's no need to borrow money for more clones. I can see why you would Want so badly to believe That the separatists Desire peace. I don't understand. In the past, whenever we've reached out our hands in peace, They've been slapped away. Can we believe that they're ready to sue for peace so easily? If I might speak with you confidentially, I know that this is sincere. I've been in contact with my old friend Miina Bonteri, And the origin of the proposal is with her. Bonteri? How was the dialogue established? Does it matter, chancellor, if the result is an end to the war? I see your point, my child. Then we shall put the vote to the floor. Sweeper droids? We didn't schedule a cleaning. Oh! What's going on? Given that the separatists have put a call for negotiations On the table, the need for additional troops seems ill-timed. Which means there is no need to deregulate the banks. I say we vote that down now. There is a move to vote on the proposed bill to lift regulations On the banking clan. Dooku promised he would stop this vote. You may enter your vote. We're under attack! The bombing of the power Generator has been confirmed As a separatist attack. They must pay for what they have done. But was the separatist congress that issued the bill of peace. Obviously a tactic to lower our defenses and launch this attack. No. That's not true. I move to immediately deregulate the banks. We need a banloan to get more troops now. What are we waiting for? I'm afraid we've been given little choice. to insure the safety of the Republic, We must deregulate the banks. I'm returning your padawan. I'm sorry your talks with Bonteri failed. How did you know? We have eyes and ears everywhere, Ahsoka. That was dangerous and careless, going to Raxus, Not to mention illegal. You went too far this time. You would do the same. You do the same all the time. This was too much. Maybe so. But I did realize something. The politics of this war, are not as black and white as I once thought they were.   \n                "}, "The Soft War": {"episode": "s05e04", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe rebels elect a new leader! With their training complete, Obi-Wan and Anakin have left Ahsoka on Onderon to monitor and advise the rebels as they continue to strike Separatists targets under the command of Steela Gerrera. Facing an escalation of rebel attacks, the Separatists have sent reinforcements to strengthen their hold on the city of Iziz, as the battle for the planet unfolds. Oh, yummy, yummy. Looks like more reinforcements. A small droid convoy leading a multi-troop transport. An AAT bringing up the rear. Copy. Ah! It's an ambush! We need reinforcements. Ah, no! Do not be afraid, brothers and sisters. We mean you no harm. It's time. People of Onderon, the time has come to take back our freedom. We have all been deceived. King Rash is a traitor who has sold Onderon to the Separatists for the crown. But Onderon is ours. We need your strength to reclaim our planet and restore our sovereignty under our true king, King Dendup. The terrorists are no longer a nuisance but a threat to Onderon. It is only a matter of time before they are all eliminated. How much longer before they plunge us into chaos? It seems they're only targeting the droid army. If you allowed the royal Onderon militia to assume control of security, the terrorists may stop and discuss terms. You will assume nothing, General Tandin. With their coordinated attacks and weapons, it is possible they're finding sympathy within your own ranks. The threat is external, and your reinforcements have done little to stop them. We will not negotiate with terrorists. They fear diplomacy. They embrace mayhem. What do we know about them? We've identified Steela Gerrera as the woman in the hologram. Her brother, Saw, is also part of the group as well as the fugitive criminal Lux Bonteri. The late senator Mina Bonteri's son? Yes, my lord. Why was I not told of this? You just were. Enough. It's clear that Dendup is behind this. We mustn't allow his followers any momentum. Justice must come swiftly, without mercy. Bring him in. What now? Your supporters have begun to publicly decry my reign. Am I still to believe you are not behind their attacks? You must order them to surrender. Impossible. I have been isolated and alone without visitors, confined to my prison. Again, the will of the people is theirs, not mine. Well, then we shall see what the will of the people is made of. Okay, guys, put it in the back with the rest. Steela. They're executing King Dendup tomorrow in Yolahn Square. Where did you hear this? Malgan Market. The merchants. The Separatists are saying he's behind our attacks. More lies. They're making him an example to humiliate us. Maybe, but their efforts could work against them. Executing him would only make him a martyr. We can't let him die. We have to break him out somehow. No, we should wait until he's in public, at the execution. That's where they'd expect it. I know, but this is our moment. We'll save him for all of Iziz to witness. We don't have much time. They're counting on us to show up. Where are you going? Trust me. Stop. Let me take care of this. This isn't about you. We can't afford a reckless move right now. Yeah? Go write a speech about it. You have to weigh the risk. That's why I'm going alone. Follow him. Steela. Saw is strong. He'll be fine. He's always been brash. Never thinks. He doesn't realize, by leaving us, he's hurting us. We need a plan. They'd bring King Dendup through the east entrance of Yolahn Square. Security will be tight. And rescuing him will will not be easy. Lux, please don't look at me like that. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I Listen. I just need to be alone right now. Gather everyone to go over the plan. Of course. I sense fear in you, Ahsoka. The rebels are divided. If they try to rescue the king now, I'm afraid we might lose them. We cannot control their fate. It's just, they're risking their lives to save just one. Do not underestimate the king's power. He represents hope and is critical to their success. I feel responsible for them. I know you do, Snips, but remember, purpose must come before feelings. I know, Master. Step in only if you must, but remember, if this experiment is to become an effective strategy, they must learn to survive on their own. Yes, Master Kenobi. I understand. Uh, hey! My lord. Who are you? I'm Saw Gerrera. What do you want? You freedom, sire. You're to be executed tomorrow, but I'm getting you out of here. The people of Onderon need your help. Stand up. Are you one of the meddlers creating disorder, interfering in the affairs of the throne? Only to restore your kingship as the rightful ruler. I see. This was all my doing. I opened the door. That's why the Separatists are here. I was faced with a difficult choice: to join the Republic or the Confederacy. Both are corrupt, but I had to pick a side before one was chosen for me, except I chose neither. Now is the time to take back Onderon. Our movement is gaining momentum. It has the backing of the Jedi. Jedi? Yes, sire. I've been waiting a long time for this. Follow me, sire. Onderon awaits. Oneway shield. Do any of you have questions? It's a risky plan, but it's our best shot. Ahsoka, will you join us? I can't. I've already been more involved than the Council wanted. I'm afraid I've been instructed to sit this one out. They have Saw. He's alive, but I watched them take him away. We have to save him. No. We have to save King Dendup. We don't have time or the bodies to do both. He's your brother. That's what Saw would want, what he would expect. And I expect the same from everyone in this room. I know it's a hard choice, but I agree. Purpose must come before feelings. Where are the other terrorists? Onderon is our system, not yours. Enough. We have to keep him alive. He is a direct link to the terrorists. You pity him. I pity your ignorance. You can control the people of Onderon, but you won't sustain it against their will. What you're doing guarantees others will take his place. They, too, will suffer. Then the war is lost. You have strong tactics, but it's unfortunate you cannot calculate a different approach. Here, drink. It will give you strength. The Separatists have very little compassion or patience for things that stand in their way. Hmm. We have a duty to protect what's ours, General, a duty once entrusted to you. I thought you depleted your arrogance with Kalani. It replenishes every hour. King Rash is the crowned head of Onderon. What's yours is his, and he will do with it as he pleases. Dendup is the true king. Are you following his orders? We take orders from no one. Aligning yourself with the past does not bode well for your future. We share the same future. We can sit here as free men or servants of the Separatists. I am free, while you have chosen to become a terrorist. I'm not a terrorist. I'm a patriot. And resistance is not terrorism. King Dendup chose his people instead of taking a side in the intergalactic war. Separatists have taken over Onderon because we let them. As your king, I present to you Ramsis Dendup not as a former king but as a criminal sponsoring terrorist acts against the people of Onderon. But fear not, good citizens. As your leader and protector, I will see that you are safe from such villainy. He has betrayed you, and today he will pay for those treasonous deeds with his life. Your people will see you into the next world. May you find forgiveness there. Time to die. Wait for my signal. Ready weapons. Not yet. Now! Come on. Go, go, go! Come with us. Blast 'em! Follow me. This way. Come on. Let's go. Surrender now or die. It's over. Do as they say. Calm yourselves. The threat is over. See for yourselves as these traitors all endure the same punishment. Good try, sis. Ready weapons. They're innocent! Let them go. The snake will not strike again. Stop. What? The only snake I see, sire, is you. Traitor. I was. Not anymore. What are you doing, General? Go. Let them through. Make way. Everyone go with them. But, sir Go. Huh. What now, General? As soon as you release me, you'll be shot dead. Jedi? General, follow me. After them. Kill them. Kill them! Dendup is the true king! We want the Separatists gone. Save Dendup! Why now? It was time for a new approach, my lord. Do I have your loyalty? And that of the army. You also have ours. With your rule, our numbers will grow. Thanks, child. Your mother would be proud. Thank you, my lord. We must first win the will of the people. That is the only way. The Separatists will assemble their forces. Count Dooku will want me dead more than ever. Then we'll have to teach them another lesson. Together. Ahsoka, I knew you couldn't resist a good fight. Am I becoming that predictable? Only to me. The Separatists definitely know we're backing the rebels. Then prepare yourself. The real fight is about to begin. Will you be able to send some help? That's up to the Council, Ahsoka.   \n                "}, "Mystery of a Thousand Moons": {"episode": "s01e18", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tHard-pressed Jedi and their valiant clone troopers have thwarted an insidious Separatist plot to plant bombs  loaded with the deadly blue shadow virus in key Republic systems. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker have captured the vile scientist behind the nefarious scheme, Dr. Nuvo Vindi. Now the Jedi prepare to transport Vindi to the Republic capital for trial. That was close. If that virus had escaped, everyone on Naboo would be dead now. Oh, well. Just another boring day saving the universe. All right, let's take this sleemo back to Theed so we can help Padm\u00e9 and Ahsoka clean up down there. Senator, you should see this. It's one of the virus bombs. It looks like the chamber that holds the virus is missing. - That droid must have taken it. - Sound the alarm. How could droids have gotten ahold of the virus containers? I don't know, but I don't want to be around when they set it off. We've already taken the virus containers out of these bombs. We'll just have to check them again. The virus is liberated. You are doomed, young Jedi, along with the rest of the planet. Hey, you. Get away from there! What was that? Virus leak. Get to the safe room. Come on! - There's the safe room! - No chance! - Hurry! The doors are closing! - Don't worry. Get inside, Captain. Hurry! Ahsoka, what is going on down there? The droids released the virus, but we managed to seal the lab. - And Padm\u00e9? - Haven't heard from her since the bomb. Anakin, can you hear me? - Anakin? - Padm\u00e9, I'm here. - Are you all right? - Yes, for the time being. Jar Jar and I were in a safety chamber when the alarm went off. We're wearing protective suits. The virus is loose, but Ahsoka has sealed off the entire facility. Yes, but any remaining droids will try to break out. I'll do what I can to stop them. I cannot let that virus escape. Be careful. Put this on. Come on, Jar Jar. We're going to find Ahsoka. We'll need her help to find those droids. Where's the antidote, Vindi? You mistake my role, Jedi. My job was to manufacture a plague, not to cure it. We don't have time for games. Patience, Anakin. There's more than one way to skin a womp rat. I said, \"where?\" Yes, kill me now and spare these old bones the blue shadow's dire embrace, because once the first droid breaks out of that laboratory, all Naboo is doomed! The fastest way to save senator Amidala and Ahsoka is to get Vindi back to the capital and find an actual antidote. Oh, no, no, no. Some of the virus got in here. We didn't close the door fast enough. We may be dead men, but we could still stop those droids. Don't worry. My Master will find a cure for this virus. - We're not dead yet. - Is anyone out there? - Can anyone hear - Senator Amidala, we're trapped in the safe room at the end of complex \"B.\" We'll be right there. Are you contaminated? I'm afraid so. Dr. Vindi, you'll pay for your treachery. Take him away. - Now we'll need to find an antidote. - I think I found an answer for you. So you think you found a cure? Possibly. A little-known extract made from reeksa root, a weed-like vine found only on Iego, the world of 1,000 moons, deep in Separatist-controlled space. Let's go. - You must move cautiously if you - There's no time for caution. My padawan is trapped on there, and so is Padm\u00e9. I mean, senator Amidala. I applaud your courage, General Skywalker, but it's suicide. Once we contain the virus, we can send troops. No, Obi-Wan and I can handle it. I concur, Anakin. Padm\u00e9 and Ahsoka will be fine. They will be, if we succeed. All the doors are locked. How are we gonna get out? - It's not our problem. - Boy, that's a relief. Senator Amidala, - where are you? - We're right outside your safety room. - Can you get the door open? - Go ahead, Jar Jar. I'm sorry, Ahsoka. Don't worry about us, senator. We still have a job to do. There aren't very many droids left. We saw some heading toward the south entrance. As long as we're able, we'll help you destroy those droids before they breach the compound. You take the north corridor, and we'll take the south. The droids are close. I can hear them cutting through the wall. - Stop! - Don't open that hatch. Too late. There it is. Iego. - What do you make of this? - It looks like a graveyard of ships. Let's go. Anakin Not good. Welcome to Iego. Roger, roger. Anakin, wait. Wait! Welcome to Iego. Very impressive. You just destroyed 17 defenseless battle droids without suffering a scratch. Welco The venerable Jaybo Hood requests an audience. Jaybo? Hey. You guys have any idea how long it took me to repurpose those droids? - You're Jaybo? - Well, do you? I apologize for my friend's rather rash behavior. Nine months, man. It took me nine months. Oh, that's our cue. Channel two. How'd a kid like you come by this many battle droids anyway? When the Separatists took off, they left all this junk behind. I got a whole warehouse - full of 'em right over there. - So you programmed them to serve you. No reason to let a good droid rust, right? Looks like you used a macro protocol to wipe them all simultaneously. - Impressive. - I see you know your droids. You're Jedi, aren't you? You want me to show you how I did it? Perhaps another time. What we need now is reeksa root. - Do you know where we can find some? - Here, there, everywhere. We don't have time for games, kid. Where's the root? What my friend is trying to say is that we are in a bit of a hurry. Not anymore you're not. Look, you little This system is haunted, cursed, whatever.

I'm so sorry. Don't blame yourself. These things tend to happen in a war zone. - Are you coming? - You've got to be kidding. No way I'm going down there. - You trying to tell us something? - Don't worry, it's simple. Follow the vines to the bottom, dig up the roots, but don't touch the vine. Aside from the obvious, why not? Because the plants don't like it, and they have big, sharp teeth. Teeth? This is getting better by the minute. And watch out for the flying Xandu. What's a Xandu? I'm not sure. Master, hop on. This isn't going to work. How are you doing up there? I'm almost through. There they are. I'm all right. There, those are the roots we're looking for. Oh, poodoo. I have a bad feeling about this. Don't take too long with that. I'll go as fast as I can. Anakin, hurry. - Anakin? Now. - Okay, okay. Got it. - Hold still. - We've got to get out of here now. You made it. I knew you would. Oh, did you? The place dried up once the spice convoy stopped running. Out here, we're just one of the millions of little backwaters no one cares about. Those of us who are left can't leave because of the curse. Cursed, we are. The planet is cursed. Cursed by whom, my twitchy friend? The ghost of Droll, that's who. A ghost? The spirit of the 1,000 moons, our protector and destroyer. - It sounds like a load of - Superstition? That's one word for it. Superstition, you say. Can't hold on much someone help me. That was Takido. He was a friend of mine. Try to leave this planet and your fate will be the same. They'll never make it past Droll. The ghost of Droll may be a local superstition, but something real blew up those ships. \"Real\" we can handle. Too bad. - I really liked those guys. - Thanks for your help, kid. - We couldn't have done it without you. - Have you run into Droll yet? Not to worry, Jaybo. What's the matter, R2? Afraid of a ghost? Droll is just a superstition There's our ghost. Lasers. We've triggered an energy field. Turn the ship around. We'll never make it through.

You saw them, Master. They're dying. A great leap forward often requires first taking two steps back. And sometimes all it requires is the will to jump. At least hear me out on this. Citizens of Iego, Droll is not a ghost. Rather, it is a Separatist security system. Nonsense. You were lucky to escape alive, simple as that. And who says we didn't make our own luck? The ghost of Droll does, that's who. Did anyone inhabit Iego's moons before the Separatists arrived? - The angels, of course. - Angels? We were a peaceful people before the Separatists drove us from our homes and stole our moon. And which moon was that? Millius Prime. The primary node, it must be near Millius Prime. Vulture droids. Jaybo, can you reactivate those vulture droids? Sure. I can even fly them by remote control. Good. We can have R2 fly the vulture droids as a decoy into the laser field. And since we know what we're up against, we can destroy the laser emitter. And cut a path right to Millius Prime. What a waste. With all due respect, Senator, It's what they're born to do. I hope that their sacrifice brings us closer to peace. It will, Padm\u00e9. - You must believe that - Ahsoka. Ready, General Kenobi. Jaybo, activate the droids. Transfer control of the vulture droids to R2. R2, intercept the lasers. Send the vulture droids directly into the laser generator. You guys okay? Guys? We're fine, kid. I'm afraid you'll need some new droids to boss around, Jaybo. The ones you lent us are pretty much toast. But the good news is that you're now free to leave Iego whenever you choose. R2, set a course for Naboo. I spoke with the medical droid. He expects you to make a full recovery. I never lost faith in you. None of us did. That's good to hear, 'cause there were a few moments where we weren't so sure of ourselves. Well, you did make it. By the way, your padawan, was brilliant. I trust I'll see you soon, General Skywalker? Of course, my lady. I heard you were quite brave fending off the battle droids, Jar Jar. Really? Senator Amidala suggested we offer you training to help hone your skills with a blaster. Really? Really. Oh, boy. I'm a-gonna be trained. I am not training him. You did a fantastic job today, Snips.

Now we find them on the run, desperate to escape the trap that is The Citadel. We're clear! What's our next move? We're going to have to fight our way off this rock. Contact the Council. See when they plan to rescue us. I'll handle it. Master Piell, it's good to see you alive, my friend. Likewise, master windu. Our escape route has been compromised, and there are several squads of droids closing in on us. When can we expect your arrival? Master Plo is already en route. Gunships will arrive to evacuate you and your men, but do not delay, only a small window of opportunity shall we have. Your rendezvous point will be this island. Understood. May the force be with you. Incoming! No doubt, there's more on the way. Count Dooku, my lord. Commander Sobeck, you've been avoiding my transmissions. My deepest respect. I was hoping to surprise you with good news. Good news would indeed be a surprise. Have the prisoners been captured? Not yet, my lord, but we've located their position and my droids are moving in now. I need not remind you that the prisoners are carrying secret hyperspace coordinates into the core systems of the Republic and our Separatist homeworlds. This information will allow us to launch a surprise attack on coruscant, striking a crippling blow to the Republic and the jedi. Yes, my lord. I will see to it that they are soon back in our possession. You should know, commander, right now your honesty is the only thing keeping you alive. They're boxing us in! Lock in your cables! Artoo, we need your droids to hold off the enemy as long as possible. Good, everybody follow me! This is sheer madness! We understand, sir. We will delay the enemy as long as possible. Prepare for attack. It was an honor to serve under you, sir. Keep moving! All for one and one for a Keep moving, keep moving! Master Tiin, you should be leading the fighter attack. Once you punch a hole through their defenses, I will lead the gunships down to the surface and extract the team. Depending on the size of their force, I don't know how much time we can buy you. You will do your best, I'm sure. If the team isn't at the extraction point when you arrive, you may be forced to leave them, or put us all at risk. I'm afraid master gallia is right. They'll be there. The prisoners have evaded us long enough. Bring out the anoobas! Use them for tracking only! Contact me as soon as the fugitives have been located. Roger, Roger. What if your jedi friends are not there when we arrive? Keep moving and you won't have to worry about that, Tarkin. Why did master Piell have to share half the intel with that guy? It's like he's not even grateful we rescued him. Captain Tarkin feels the jedi should be relieved from the burden of leading the war effort. That's ridiculous. Maybe, but we aren't soldiers. We're peacekeepers. The jedi code often prevents us from going far enough to achieve victory. A rather simple point of view. Either way, he is a good captain. Did you hear that? Yes. We're going to have company. Commander, the additional reinforcements have arrived. Tighten your grip, K2-B4. The Republic will almost certainly attempt a second mission to infiltrate our defenses and rescue the prisoners. I'm counting on you to ensure that nothing slips past our blockade. You know it's not wise to argue with master Piell. It's certainly not a good career move. General Skywalker, I stand by my principles, no matter what. Besides, I needn't worry about my career. I've fallen into favor with the chancellor. He shall support me. Oh, I happen to know the chancellor quite well, myself. Oh, really? Really. Let's keep moving. If we're not at the rendezvous at the exact time, we'll miss our window. Those creatures are gaining. If they've caught our scent, they'll lead the droids right to us. We're gonna have to deal with them. What about using this cave to surprise them? If we can get them to pass by, we can attack them from behind, but we need a distraction. Leave that to me. And Obi-Wan, of course. Okay, the rest of you, follow me. Keep going! Ahsoka and I will take care of the droids. Master Piell! I have to get help. No. Don't leave. Listen to me carefully, child. The information, I need you to deliver it back to the Council. I should find Anakin or Obi-Wan. They need to hear this. No. You must listen. But I wasn't assigned to the team. I lied just so I could be a part of the mission. Whether you were meant to be on this mission or not, you are now the most important part of it. Remember this, and see to it that the information I'm about to give you is revealed to no one but the jedi Council. Sir! The anoobas have located the fugitives along the northern shore. Squad, come with me! I will deal with this personally. So much for the hunting party. There are more squads on their way. Oh, no. He died honorably. What about the information? I have it. He told me just before he died. We don't have much time. Let's take this moment to honor him, then we must move on. He would have wanted us to complete our mission. There have not been battles like these since the days of the old Republic. Indeed. Good hunting. There's the extraction point. Incoming! Look what I found. They are too many droid fighters. We need more time to break through the blockade. We're out of time, master Tiin. We must break through now. Very well. Wing commanders, form up. We're going in. Captain! If I can't have the information, it will die with you. My thanks, padawan Tano. I see you've trained her well. The rescue ship should be here by now. So should the rest of the separatist army. I believe you've worn out your welcome. Admiral coburn, we have the survivors. Recall all fighters. Yes, general. Prepare to jump to lightspeed. We're all ready, admiral. Of master Piell's loss, we are sorry to hear. He will be missed. Because of his great sacrifice, we now have the nexus route coordinates. Captain Tarkin and Ahsoka have each memorized half. Debrief them both, we must. With all due respect, master jedi, I was instructed by chancellor Palpatine to bring the intel directly to him for debriefing. I promised master Piell that I would deliver it only to the Council, and that's what I will do. Hmm. Personally meet with the chancellor, I will. Decide what is best to do, we shall. Master Plo, there's something we want to ask you. Did you assign ahsoka to the mission? It appears I did. A job well done, general Skywalker. I wish more jedi had your military sensibilities. Perhaps I can inform the chancellor of your valor. I'm not sure what to think of your new ally. Well, I think we need people like him. This is a war. If we aren't willing to do what it takes to win, we risk losing everything we try to protect. Unfortunately, war tends to distort our point of view. If we sacrifice our code, even for victory, we may lose that which is most important: Our honor.   \n                "}, "Bounty Hunters": {"episode": "s02e17", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tThe death toll rises, as the battles intensify and threaten a growing number of republic worlds. Planets are left to survive on their own while the Jedi struggle to fight a war on many fronts. A series of medical stations have been established as a lifeline for those in need. But the facilities are easy prey for separatist attacks. After losing contact with the medical station orbiting Felucia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano are sent to investigate. That's Felucia. Dead ahead. But where's the medical station? I don't see anything on my scanners. Wait, there's something. Vulture droids. Hang on. I guess we know what happened to the medical station. That's not good. They took out the plasma conduit. You thinking what I'm thinking? Almost certainly not. We're doing this the hard way. Starting ejection sequence. How come every time you fly, we crash? It's not my fault. It's the ship. Ready to eject. Wait Now! You always blame the ship. You alright there, Master? I'm fine, Anakin. Where on Felucia do you think we are? I'm not sure. I don't like the sound of that. And I don't like the look of that. We don't want to scare 'em. We can't just wander around. We need a plan. You taught me to go on instinct. My instincts say to go that way. That doesn't seem right. I think we should go this way. Why do you ask for my opinion? You never do things my way. We crashed the ship your way. Very funny. I see your sense of humour survived the landing. It's about the only thing. If you two are done arguing, I think there's some smoke on the horizon. Which means people. And a way off this planet. Look, there's a village. Maybe they have a ship we can \"borrow\". Hmm. They're growing healing herbs. Sillum, I believe. One of the most valuable crops in the galaxy. This place looks deserted. I don't believe it is. The crops are ready to be harvested. Tools are lying about. Something's amiss. Well, there's one thing I learned where I grew up. You want to know what a farmer is up to, look in their barn. This is an odd ship for farmers. Perhaps someone is here to pick up the sillum. I still don't get it. Where is everyone? Mystery solved. They're terrified. It's OK. We won't hurt you. Kindly drop your weapons, Jedi. Take it easy. We don't want any trouble. It's not always about the numbers. Four on one is hardly a fair fight, even for a Jedi. Wait a minute. Four on one? You mean four on two? We don't count you. Do you count me? Stop. Don't harm them. Can't you see these are Jedi? We are saved. Saved? Need I remind you, you already made a deal with us? But with the Jedis' help Excuse me, but help you with what? Pirates. Simply stated, if we don't give the pirates a portion of our crop, they will destroy our homes, with us in them. Hmm. I see your dilemma. Sillum farming is a meagre trade Without our herbs to sell we will have no money for food, fuel or equipment. And yet you can afford to pay mercenaries. These bounty hunters drive a more reasonable bargain than pirates. Why not just fight them yourselves? Easy for you perhaps, but look at us. We are farmers, not warriors. Even with the bounty hunters' help, I had feared the worst. But now there are seven of you. What do you want, Jedi? We need a ship. Ours is beyond repair. The one in the barn. That'll do. That's our ride. It doesn't go anywhere without us. And right now we are busy. Busy extorting farmers? I don't hear you offering to help. Unfortunately, we couldn't help even if we wanted to. What? Master, these farmers are in trouble. Why can't we help them? Believe me, I would like nothing more. However, we need to report that a medical station has been destroyed. If we stay too long, the separatists will show up here. - But - Better they get robbed by pirates than attract the interest of General Grievous. Pirates! Pirates, pirates. The pirates are back. That's far enough. I speak for the people of this village. State your name and business. My name is my own business. And my business is taking what's ours! There is nothing here that's yours. Unless you're here to buy it. Buy it? Ha ha! Kenobi! Skywalker! I can't believe you came all this way to see me. - Hondo. - Hondo. You know each other? Of course we do. Tell them how far back we go. Too far, I'm afraid. Ha ha! And I thought we were friends. If you're truly interested in friendship, Hondo, might I suggest you stop threatening these farmers? Threatening them? Oh, please tell me you have not been listening to these bounty-hunting scum. Scum? We're just here to help them protect what's theirs. Oh, come, come, my dear. How much are they paying you? Ba, ba! It does not matter. Whatever it is, I will double it. And all you have to do to earn it is step aside. We don't break deals. Steady, everyone. What is your stake, anyway? All we want is a ride to the nearest republic outpost. And I'm willing to pay you handsomely for it. Twice what you could make selling this crop. Well, now, how do you plan to pay me? A funds transfer when we arrive. Republic credit? Tut. We've been over this before, Kenobi. My associates don't accept that currency. I'm offering a deal that benefits us all. Don't let your greed blind you to that fact. You know, I like you, Kenobi. But no one leaves this planet until I get my sillum. Then I hope you enjoy it here. Because you'll be staying a long time, parasite! You know, this crop has not been harvested. You better hurry, old man, before things start to die on you. When the attack comes, it will come from two fronts. The forest to the south and the ridge to the north. Whatever you do, you must defend both sides. But there are only four of them. How can four bounty hunters defend against so many? The farmers are right. These bounty hunters don't stand a chance. We've been over this, Anakin. You seem to lack confidence in our abilities, young Jedi. I'm sure you're good at what you do. But you are in way too deep. Said the peacekeeper who fails to keep the peace. The rift in the galaxy is not our fault. If more worlds would stand up for themselves against the separatists, this war would have been over long ago. That's it. We'll just train the villagers to defend themselves. But we are just simple farmers. Why are we paying bounty hunters to defend us if we're just going to end up doing it ourselves? Hush. Trust me. We'll have you ready. Put it in the barn, every bushel. Alright, everyone, form up. Um, divide into rows of five. I told you, we are not soldiers. We do not even have weapons. May I? Yeah. These'll do. What happens if you need the barn as a fallback position? With all the sillum here it will be difficult to squeeze the farmers in. There's room. I worry that you care more for the safety of the sillum than you do for the safety of the villagers. You think I'm only worried about my profit. Is that it? The thought had crossed my mind. So in your mind I am just like any other pirate? - Am I wrong? - Not entirely. But it is easier to protect the villagers and the sillum if they are both in the same place. - Might I suggest - You might suggest anything you like, General Kenobi. But I know what I am doing. I will keep these people safe my way. Seripas, it's too heavy! Seripas? Don't look! I'm having a suit malfunction. Ha Not very intimidating, am I? You don't have to look tough to be tough. I thank you for your help. The bounty hunter is right. Every minute you waste teaching us to twirl these stupid poles is time you could have spent beating those pirates yourself. And what good would that do you? Another band of brigands would come along. Or do you intend to give away part of your crop every harvest season? If you make us do this, there won't be another harvest season. Alright, everyone, get back in position. Let's continue. Oh, what have we here? Getting ready for a fight, are we? There. A scout! Embo! Quick work. Yes, but when this scout fails to report to Hondo he'll be coming, soon. The scout has not checked in from the village. He's long overdue. Well, well. So it looks like the Jedi are getting involved. Or at least we now know we can't take these villagers for granted. But you know what I always say speak softly and drive a big tank. The farmers are in position. Well, the ones who stuck around anyway. Very well, Anakin. Turn on the fence. Battle positions, everyone! Embo! Embo. Can you hear me? You'll be alright. We'll get you inside. Everyone, fall back to the barn! That tank is going to tear the villagers apart. Get him inside. We'll hold them off as long as we can. Die, Jedi scum! - No! - Watch your flank! Your situation is hopeless, Skywalker. - Welcome back. Are you alright? - Fine. The captain! Let's go! The day is won. Help me. Skywalker, let me call off my men. This effort is no longer profitable! There are crops to harvest, fields to till, hearts to rebuild. Now, let's get to work. How can I ever thank you for saving our village? We didn't save your village. Your people did. The first time in my memory my people don't have to be afraid. We will never forget you. I seem to find myself light on company. Still need that ride back to the republic outpost? If it wouldn't be any inconvenience. On the contrary, it would be my pleasure.   \n                "}, "Innocents of Ryloth": {"episode": "s01e20", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tInvasion! Separatist leader Wat Tambor has taken control of the planet Ryloth and subjugates its people through a brutal droid occupation. In a daring surprise attack, Jedi Anakin Skywalker and his padawan, Ahsoka Tano, defeated the space blockade guarding the planet. Now Jedi Generals Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi lead a massive invasion to liberate the starving people. First trick will be getting our troops on the ground. If you take the city of Nabat first, we'll have our landing zone. Well, it's time to meet the natives. You must not allow the clones to reach the surface. Our new proton cannon are in the optimum position to prevent that, sir. What? What if they focus the attack on your cannon? I am utilizing the prisoners from this village as living shields. I calculate the Jedi will not risk the prisoners' safety with a direct assault. We need to remember why we're here. We came to aid the Twi-leks, not destroy their home. Cody? That means we'll be taking it back the hard way. Minimal destruction with blasters and droid poppers only. No rockets or detonators. Check your aim. Keep an eye out for the locals. Am I understood? Sir, yes, sir! If we're her to free the tail-heads, the list they can do is get out of our way. Sir, the enemy is in range. Fire at will. General, the enemy fire is penetrating our shields. Get me Kenobi. We can't risk landing the larger transports - until you take out those guns. - Pull back. We'll take care of it. Commander, the Republic transports have turned away, but the gunships are still heading toward us. Just as I calculated. I think I see movement in the trees. Fire, fire! That bunker is gonna be a problem, General. Leave the bunker to me. Bring in your troopers on my signal! Let's take them out! Ghost company. Let's move! Sir, I've lost contact with our outer defenses. The Republic troops have overrun the village perimeter. Find out how the Jedi plan to attack. Roger, roger. The wall is secure, sir. Are we moving on to the guns? We need to know what the droids have in store for us. Send your best men to scout ahead. Will do, sir. Boil, Waxer, come with me. I guess we're the best. Buildings are just buildings. What really makes a city are the inhabitants that live in it. So where are they? We'll check out the courtyard. You two, take the south sector. Be back at command by 0620. Yes, sir. I tell you, Boil, this is creepy. You think they've killed all of them? Well, there are no bodies. They were driven from their homes. I don't think they had a Had a what? Choice. Not going to be easy getting to those guns, sir. There is always a way, Wooley. Wait, Twi'leks. They're holding all the survivors hostage. We have to report this to General Kenobi. They're in the courtyard here and here. But there's a complication. They've taken the locals hostage and they're using them as shields. The Twi'lek prisoners will make this difficult but not impossible. I still have a good plan for taking out those guns. Getting the villagers out of harm's way is our first priority. I have faith in you, General Kenobi. Cody, we'll go in with everything we have. Clear those hostages. So it's General Kenobi who is leading this assault. He is known for his deceptive maneuvers. Roger, roger. Download his file. - It's just a little girl. - What are we going to do with her? Why do we have to do anything? - We've got a mission to finish. - We should do something. - I say we take her with us. - You can't be serious. She'll only slow us down. - Look, she's afraid of us. - Not us. Quick, hide! That was a recon unit. We'd better get moving. We can't leave her here. Fine, we'll take her. Be careful. Don't worry, Waxer. I don't think she's armed. Little tail-head bit me. Stop, you're scaring her. She probably thinks we're droids. It's all right. See, I'm flesh and blood, just like you. She looks half starved. Here. No, I'm Waxer. He's Boil. You made a friend. Mission accomplished. Can we go now? Come on, kid. Come on. Look, she doesn't even want to go. Little monster was fine before we came along, so let's move. Sergeant, are the creatures ready? I starved them, like you ordered, sir. I wonder what happened to her family. They're probably dead. Hopefully, she'll survive this mess. So what happens to her? I mean, after we leave. I don't know. Don't get any ideas. We're not taking her with us. She's gone. I'm sure the little biter will turn up. There you are. How'd she get in front of us? No, don't go that way! That's where the recon droid went. Waxer, let her go. I'm not just going to let the droids get her. I'm just trying to keep you alive! I'll be darned if I know why. Where's she going? Wait! Hold on, there! There you are. Good, you caught her. You know, I have binders if we need 'em. What? What are we doing here, anyway? I guess this was her home. Poor little thing. She lost it all. It's okay now. We're here to help. Don't cry, kid. We'll keep you safe. I promise. The men set, Cody? What is it? Waxer and Boil are not responding. - They never returned from scouting. - That isn't like them. They may have run into trouble. Sergeant, use the high-powered transmitter, - see if you can reach Waxer and Boil. - Yes, sir! Let's get the rest of the men moving. The others will catch up. They are on the move. Sergeant, the attack is coming. Release the beasts. It is time to execute my plan. Roger, roger. It's the commander. We're way overdue, Waxer. We're going to end up polishing R2 units. Wait. How are we going to explain all this, her? You're asking me? Maybe if we hurry back, we can tell them we ran into a little trouble. Oh, that's for sure. And our transmissions were jammed by the droids. It's worth a try. But mark my words, this will end badly. I think I know why the kid never came back here. You see what happens when we don't follow orders? Let's get out of here! These suckers won't give up! You grab the gun and I'll hold 'em back. - Aim for their eyes! - Look out, look out! Fall back! The Republic ground troops have been routed, Emir. What was that? I calculate the remaing clones are attempting a desperate final offensive. Their chances of success against us are 742:1. You had better be right. I am a droid. I am always right. No, wait. - Incredible. - Quiet, rookie. Shoot the bridge! Don't shoot. Waxer, Boil. Where have you two slackers been? Sir, there is an explanation. We got sidetracked. I think I see what sidetracked you. The clones have defeated the creatures. Yes, but their numbers are thin. Prepare for their final attack. Hello, little one. She brought us here through the tunnels. Knows her way around them pretty good, sir. The girl can lead us through the tunnel to the prisoners. Cody, we're going to need a diversion. Yup, this is about the worst job in the droid army. What? What? I'll take care of this. You keep her here. There they are. Let's go! Pull back! Pull back!

The communications center, perhaps, their target is They must be in the central ventilation system Let me check the system You're right: there has been a disturbance It's near the top of the south tower I'll meet you up there On high alert place the temple The control board for the fan should be on your left All clear, sir Not quite The fan you're passing through has a security switch I do not see anything Besides, we have already gotten past the fan Todo, we're getting sucked into the fan - Turn it off - I do not know how - Cato, do something - I've got it from here Sorry Okay, Bane, the next part is relatively simple Make your way down the shaft until you reach Excuse me I don't mean to disturb you, but the whole temple is on high alert Thank you This is it Perfect Let's go in Cato, come in We are over the vault Give me a moment to check out the security system What's wrong with your voice? Change of plans I'm the librarian now Hurry it up, Cato We can't stay hidden for long Well, looks like this is where they broke in Fortunately, we'll have a less troublesome time The vault is filled with laser sensors that go in every direction I'll try to deactivate the whole system from here Just hurry I can hear them They're looking for us in the vent system Great Which way do you think they went? The communications center is this way We'd better hurry if we're going to catch them The Jedi are coming closer I've got it Go in I don't think they came this way Master Yoda, are you picking up any other life signs in this quadrant? Deep in the temple, the intruders are How are they managing to stay out of our way? Possible it is, receiving assistance they are, from inside Wonderful Almost there Are you done deactivating those laser beams yet? - We are good to go - Good Start cutting through that wall This job just keeps getting weirder and weirder Padawan, alert you must be Sense deception, I do Posing as a Jedi, the intruder is Find Master Jocasta, you must The two Jedi have turned around and are making their way towards you Who are you, and what have you done with madame Jocasta? The same thing I'm going to do to you You may have madame Jocasta's shape, but not her skills - Todo, are you done yet? - These things take time Some butler droid you turned out to be I am a techno-service droid Looks like you were right Master Skywalker, I've captured the imposter disguised as a Jedi She says the intruder's in the holocron vault A holocron is no good without a Jedi to open it - What are they up to? - They must be trying to gain access to the communications center from the vault Let's get in I am not going to be able to do this without a diagram Cato, come in - What has happened? - Something's gone wrong Todo, is the hole finished? - Yes, but - Go to the communications center - What? - You heard me Bane, the communications center will be crawling with Jedi - Why do I need to go in there? - Now Quick The communications center Let's go Hey, guys I was just, testing the access hatch Works great - Bomb - Bomb? What bomb? Is there something going to blow up? Bomb Madame librarian, are you okay? I think I'm all right We must call security Our war operations, it was never about Come on, changeling We have a new home for you What would someone want with a holocron? Wait Bolla Ropal What did you say? That's who Bane's next target is Some Jedi What's wrong? Who's Bolla Ropal? He is the keeper of the Kyber crystal, the data on which can only be read by holocrons What's on the crystal? A list of every known force-sensitive child in the galaxy The future younglings The future of the Jedi Order We have to warn him That's going to be hard to do He's out of contact, somewhere in the Devaron system Seek him out, you must Ahsoka and I will set out immediately If this Cad Bane is still here on Coruscant, I'll find him Stolen secrets Villainous mercenary Cad Bane was hired by Darth Sidious to steal a holocron from the vaults of the Jedi Temple After fleeing the scene of the crime, Bane hunted down and captured Master Bolla Ropal, who has a crystal which holds secrets of the Jedi Order As a separatist fleet arrives to help the bounty hunter, Anakin Skywalker races in to cut off their escape and stop Bane from delivering the stolen holocron I guess we're going down with the ship Roger, roger General, we're receiving an urgent transmission from the planet General Skywalker, our base has been overrun There's no possibility of evacuation They've taken General Ropal and the holocron memory crystal Do you know where they've taken them? Sorry, sir We tried to stop them, but they left the outpost Wait a second There's too much interference Transmitter's been destroyed at the source, sir We have to find out what ship Master Ropal was on You will remain conscious, Master Jedi The bounty hunter has some questions for you Attach mind limiters, pain pulsers, and give him a full dose of X-C33 Right away, sir Sir, that Republic ship has destroyed our escort and is blocking our escape Whoever's commanding that cruiser is a bold one Move us out of the battle zone and prepare to jump to hyperspace I have a small favor to ask our Jedi guest General, a separatist command ship is fleeing the battle You think they have Master Ropal on board as a prisoner? I'm sure of it Admiral, intercept them before they can jump to hyperspace - I'll ready the troops for boarding - Boarding? We have no boarding craft We were prepared to land on the planet, not to board another ship You can't be serious I am, Admiral Thank you for your opinion Now, target their hyperdrive We don't want them getting away Sir Captain Sir They hit the power converters, so we can't go into hyperspace I wonder what the Jedi are planning I've rounded up three brigades, sir Where are we going? We're going to board a separatist frigate, rescue Master Ropal, and recover an archive holocron We have no assault craft, sir, only a couple of fighters and the twilight Waiting for orders And the plan is? Just curious I came down to see if I could be of any help, General Skywalker Actually, you can Activate those walkers, Admiral You're not thinking of using those to transport the clones to that frigate Well, they are pressurized And they're equipped with magnetic feet - Good call - Master, you're a genius Those walkers designed for terrain, not space Rex, load them up Let's go, snips Execute battalion, take AT-AT 300 Carnivore battalion, walker 773 Let's go Simply open this little box of yours so I can get the information from this crystal, and your suffering will come to an end You will never get me to unlock the holocron Unfortunately, I don't have time to discuss this with you Hit him again Full power I'm not sure how much more of this he can take Are you a medical droid? Then step back and shut up - Roger, roger - More power We've lost all his vital signs Check He is no longer functioning Drop him He's dead Looks like we will have to find another Jedi to open this Holocron Only next time, I will try a different method When Darth Sidious asked me to loan you the federation fleet, he didn't say you were going to war You have already lost four of my ships I hope you can pay for all of this One authentic Jedi Holocron and the memory crystal I was after When my benefactor gets this, he will compensate you for your puny fleet Sounds like the Jedi want it back The Jedi are overwhelming our vulture droids Should we send out reinforcements? What are you doing? Did you say, \"No?\" Roger, roger The Jedi will board the ship and get the holocron back Transmit the information and close the deal immediately I can't Only a Jedi can access the device Fortunately, there are two Jedi on their way to help me, one more than we need for our purposes You'd better live through this I want my money, Bane You can count on it Wipe all the frigate's memory banks and destroy every record of our mission Initiate the self-destruct sequence You, transfer all ship functions to my wrist-com I want control of doors, gravity generators, everything The rest of you, stay here and defend the bridge We're defending the bridge alone? Against the Jedi? I hate this job Don't shoot I'm not the Commander He's the Commander Guess I'm the Commander now R2, see if you can find Master Ropal One authentic Jedi Holocron and the memory crystal I was after He has both pieces now Rex, send a squad Lock down the hangar bay and destroy all the escape pods - No one gets off this ship - Yes, sir R2, you have to find Master Ropal Hurry What was that? One of the engines on that frigate has exploded I caution you to avoid the AFT section - How much damage is there? - I suggest immediate evacuation Not until we get what we came for Spread out While you take on the clones, I will separate the Jedi and lead one of them away Master, I found him Rex, have some men take Master Ropal back to the Resolute We might not be able to find the holocron in time, Master But if it's destroyed with the ship, Nute Gunray won't get it either Maybe, but I'd rather return it to the library personally Come on, R2 R2 says we're close Stay sharp Switch to night vision There Welcome, Jedi We've been expecting you Kill them Let's make this a bit more interesting Lock down Magnetics You were trained for this Turn the gravity generators back on Check your fire Hit one of those shells, and this fight is over for all of us I'll get him, Master Ahsoka, wait It's a trap Ahsoka, wait We'll take him together You thought you could get away? You're not much of a challenge I got you right where I want you I'm not impressed Can you hear me? Are you all right in there? I'm all right Get back to the hangar Find a transport, but wait for us as long as you can - We're on it, sir - Ahsoka, do you copy? There's a power surge heading toward the bridge If you're there, get out immediately You must abandon your mission I don't have the holocron memory, and I seem to have misplaced my Padawan The ship is tearing itself apart Move off to a safe distance, Admiral, and await my signal for evacuation Of all the Jedi, why did I have to end up with Skywalker? I wouldn't do that Those binders have been specially designed for Jedi The more you struggle, the tighter they get Impressed now, youngling ? Not really Enjoy this while you can, sleemo This burning boat is about to finish us both off We have time The bond between a Jedi teacher and his apprentice is strong Which means my Master will be coming for me any minute Let's see if we can get him here any faster - You said we'd be safe back here - Come on There's three of us and only one of him It won't matter Sir, a Jedi is coming He looks very unhappy Your Master has gotten the message You have nowhere left to run, bounty hunter Let me worry about that, Jedi If I activate this control, the outside air lock will open, and she will be sucked into oblivion Do you think you can kill me and then save her before she's pulled out into space? It's a horrible way to die Besides, isn't negotiation the Jedi way? - What do you want? - This holocron carries information I've been paid to collect I can't unlock it, but you can The last Jedi who had it wouldn't open it I hope you don't make the same mistake We don't have much time Hurry up, Jedi, or she dies No, Master Don't do it I can't let you die, Ahsoka Master, no We'll deal with the holocron later How touching All units, make for that shuttle Captain, the main reactor is exposed It will implode at any moment Yes, sir We're trying to make our way to the shuttle now - Get out of there - Sir, yes, sir You two find the General and help him This frigate's not going to last - We have to get out of here - Yes, sir Come about We need to put some distance between us and that frigate Now I will combine this holocron with the memory crystal I acquired from your dead Jedi friend My employers will be most pleased Did the Jedi cooperate with you? With some encouragement I have access to the holocron and all the information the memory contains I only have to get off this ship Maybe you should transmit it to me now Then I could send another ship for you No, thanks, Viceroy I have a plan for my own escape Hold it right there You're not going anywhere, bounty hunter I hope you found us a ride off this bucket We've got to leave now The reactor's gonna blow - We cannot wait - You'll have to I'm going after that bounty hunter Master, wait Stop This is the way to the hangar We must get off the ship now - I can't let Bane get away - Patience, Master Patience You're right Come on, Come on Trooper, did you get the holocron? - No, sir - I'll get it, Master No time Rex, get us out of here It looks like the holocron was destroyed, but at least the Separatists didn't get it Bane's dead, but I can still feel him Master I'm sorry I let that mercenary get the upper hand It wasn't your fault, Ahsoka It was mine, start to finish So did you manage to recover the holocron or capture the bounty hunter?

'A rare and welcome respite from endless battle awaits Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu as they travel through deep space aboard the Jedi cruiser Endurance, preparing to rendezvous with a Republic frigate.' 'The Jedi remain unaware of a deadly peril lying hidden in their midst.' War does not come with a guarantee. No soldier gets the promise of safety, survival or victory. But men, I guarantee you this. Every member of this clone youth brigade will have his moment. And it is that moment when you are no longer a cadet, you are a soldier. (There's the Jedi cruiser.) You have the best training in the galaxy, but no-one can train you for the moment you look death in the eyes. What you do then and the soldier you become, that is up to you. Docking procedures begin shortly. Until then, dismissed! Who's the new guy, with the long hair? Some last-minute replacement. Looks green to me. Hey. What outfit are you from? I heard they had that tour. They did. I, er, I couldn't make it. Broken arm. A real trooper could lose an arm and still report for duty. So, what are you? Soft? What's going on here, gentlemen? Just having a little fun. Oh, I've seen your kind of fun, hot shot. Stand down. Come on, Whip, the air's getting stale around here. Hey. What's your name? I'm Lucky. Jax. Thanks. But I can handle myself. Yeah, sure, but a trooper's only as strong as the trooper beside him. We're all in it together, right? Right. And with the training we've got, I feel ready for anything. Ah, don't be nervous. Only thing between us and them is experience. It's not like they're Jedi. Morning, troops. Welcome aboard the Jedi cruiser, Endurance. I am Mace Windu. And this is - Anakin Skywalker. Welcome aboard. Today you'll see how a real, working, Jedi cruiser operates. You'll have the chance to serve right alongside two Jedi Knights. Serious? Wow! That's wicked! We're gonna get training! Generals. New orders from General Kenobi await you in the war room. Immediately. Another time, then. You seem more disappointed than our cadets. It's our job to instruct and inspire. You just wanted to show off. Hey. When I show off, it IS instructive. And inspiring. For you, maybe. Looks easy, doesn't it? Well, looks can be deceiving. There's nothing more dangerous in all of space than a moving target. What do you use for targets, sir? Malfunctioning droids. Mechanical skeet packed with explosives. Now, this is my ship and my rules. I do not allow tourists onboard. Only soldiers. Now, time for target practice. You there, take the gun. Not even close. Next. But I only - Oh, no. You're done. You only get one chance. I promise you the Separatists don't give more.Next. Near miss is still a miss, kid. Right. Training is no match for experience and it's the one thing none of you have. I know that look. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Wow! I see why they call you lucky. Let's see how you are when Seppies come at you in attack formation. Alright, cut the chatter, men. We're due at Observation Deck 13. Now, that's a cadet to watch. Cadet 1151, tell me where this Jedi Cruiser's main stabilisers are. Sir! Hull 17 behind the main reactor, sir. Good. Cadet 1174, how many engines fail before auxiliary power kicks in? Sir! three on port AND starboard side, sir. Channel-7 open. Ready to receive Code-5 transmission. (COMM) \"Boba, is that you?\" It is. \"I'm sending you the data now.\" Received transmission. Boba out. Hey. What are you doing here? Erm, communiques, sir. Eyes only. I've been dispatched to General Windu's quarters. There's no problem, sir. Oh, there's a problem. You're lying. Admit it. You're lost. Come on, cut the kid a break. Windu's quarters are that way, shiny. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Eyes on where you're headed, cadet. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Cadet 327. What reaction propels the main engines of this Jedi cruiser? Post-combined sparking off the reactor core rods, sir. Hmm. Excellent. Sir, General Skywalker requests your presence on the Bridge. (SIGHS) I'll be there shortly. The General requests your presence immediately, sir. No rest for the weary. Put these inside my quarters, would you? Yes, sir. Are you alright? Trooper! Trooper! This doesn't look like a drill. No time for chatter. There's been an explosion. Let's show these troops how the Clone Youth Brigade rises to the challenge. Line up. I don't want any heroes. Our job's to get to the nearest safe room. Let the troops do their job! Think it's a Seppy attack? Out here? The perfect place for it.You heard the Sergeant. Secure the loose talk. Status report, trooper. The ship's undamaged. One man down. General Windu's quarters got hit but he survived. Survived? You're lucky to be alive. Our trooper? Dead. This was no accident. Agreed. Keep moving! The ship's navigation is nearby. Admiral, has the navigation been damaged? Puddled, not destroyed. Systems are repairable. I've ordered shutdown of all engines until we're fully operational. We'll hold orbit over Vanqor. Any sign of attack ships? None. But we'll keep scanning. Until we get navigation back,the Endurance is a fat, easy target. I won't have it! Killian out. Navigation wasn't the target and hitting your quarters was intentional. \"(BLEEPING)\" This is Boba. It's a miss, repeat, a miss. What should I do? \"Head to the reactor, blow the core.\" -But the crew, it isn't about them, just Mace. \"If you want Windu dead, do as I say!\" We have a killer on board this ship and we are locked in dead space. Just like our assassin. We'll form an unbroken line of troopers and scour the ship from bow to stern, checking every corridor, bulkhead and storage unit. I want him alive. Hey, you there! Come here. I got lost, sir. The ship's on full lockdown, son. Yes, sir, I know, sir. I'll return to my company. Er, not alone, you won't. Emergency protocols are in effect. I'll call a trooper to escort you. This is CT-1477. I need an escort Is that a DC-15A? Yeah. Here, keep the safety on. \"Copy that, CT-1477. We're pretty overloaded but will get there soon.\" What?! What are you doing? We're brothers, don't shoot. You're not my brother. Don't shoot! Don't worry. \"CT-1477, report in.\" \"CT-1477, why have you broken off transmission?\" Our sweep has now covered over half the ship, Admiral. Still no sign of the assassin. The more ground we cover, the less there is in which to hide. (SNORTS) More action than you signed on for, eh, boys? We're headed for the safe room now, sir. Fine. Although, on second thoughts, let's make a drill of it. Head for the pods. Escape pods? It must be bad. Escape pods, sir? Mmm. I wanna see what they're made of. I'll even time you. It'll all make a fine story when you return to your base. This can't be happening. Get a hold of yourself. Prepare to launch the distress beacon. We're going down. Get your men out of here, there's nothing more you can do. R2, prep the fighters and be ready to take off. Lucky! Stay with the group. Yes, sir. How are we gonna get through this? Groups of four men. Take pods 1 and 2. Set rendezvous coordinates with the other pods at a safe distance from the cruiser. See you at Rendezvous-Mark-Six. This is the moment, men. Make it yours. Argh! The pod's malfunctioned. The main reactor's beyond hope. You have to abandon ship. No. You must abandon ship. I'm staying. We missed the rendezvous. Argh! I can't stop it! I'm staying. You'd better evacuate. Admiral, you must abandon ship. Not a chance. But sir, with respect, that's an order! -It may be your command, but it's my ship! We don't have time for that kind of sentiment! It's not sentiment! An admiral must go down with his ship! I don't expect you to understand it, Jedi. We're lost. What happened? Do we still have control? Navigation's shot. Looks like our pod was damaged in the escape. Can we steer? No. How about fuel? No feed. We're dead weight. So, what do we do? Our jobs. Get ready to attach the hyperspace rings. Admiral, what's your status? \"We're caught in gravitational pull.\" We're going to try to set her down on the surface. Once you're down, we'll get the rescue teams to you. \"General Skywalker?\" Yes, Sergeant? It's the cadets, sir. I can't raise them on any channel,and their locater beacon's not active. Theirs is the only pod unaccounted for. Sounds like our saboteur may have gotten to the cadets. We have to find that pod. What was that? I don't know. A ship, I think. Rescue ship? It's too early. (CLANKING) What the? Well, what do we have here? You boys look lost. Congratulations, Boba. Job well done. His name's not Boba. He's Lucky. Lucky?! That's a good one. You're with her?! I wasn't expecting you to bring friends along. I couldn't help it, Aurra. What are you gonna do with them? What do you think? Let them go? Ah. They're living witnesses, honey. That was never part of the plan. I just wanted to kill the Jedi that murdered my father. Well, that will have to wait. Grow up! You'll get your revenge in time. Now, get onboard. We have to get out of here. Or you can go with your \"friends\", who I'm going to jettison into the unknown. That would be poetic. I'm sorry. Traitor! Do it! You'll regret this! I can't believe it. A traitor? He was a traitor?! Yes, well, we can't worry about that now. We have to try to contact somebody. We already tried. This pod is dead! We only have minimal life support. Yeah? Well, whose fault is that? None of us! That guy you defended left us for dead! Stop it! We need to work together. You're not in charge They have come back to finish us off. No, wait, it's the Jedi! I've found your missing cadets. \"Nice one, General. How are they?\" I can't raise them on the comm channel. Their pod must be damaged. \"Head to Point-038 and you can pick them up.\" Right away, sir. Skywalker, have you heard from Admiral Killian? No. I lost contact when they entered the atmosphere. I'm sorry. I lost my head. I It's OK. I understand. I can't believe he was one of us. Someone just like us. He's nothing like us! Let's hope he is.

All of our warriors were exiled To our moon, concordia. They died out years ago. hmm. Are you certain?

You sound tired. the peaceful ways of the Locals wore me out a bit.   \n                "}, "Secret Weapons": {"episode": "s05e10", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tSecret transmission intercepted! The Jedi Council has intercepted an encoded transmission of General Grievous. However, Republic Intelligence officers have failed to crack the new encryption code being used by the droids. Fears escalate that the Separatists are about to mount a major offensive. Having located the source of the transmission deep in Separatist space, the Jedi plan a counterstrike to capture an enemy decoding chip which will allow them to understand the transmission and thwart the Separatist plot. Time is not on our side, so I'll make this short. You droids have been chosen for a very important mission. There's an encryption module on board this Separatist dreadnought. This device is scrambling all Separatist communication in the region. We believe you five can get behind enemy lines, infiltrate the vault without drawing attention to yourselves, and steal that encryption module. WAC-47, reporting for duty! Sorry I am late. I thought the message said to meet in the \"Jedi storeroom,\" whatever that is. Heh. So did I miss anything? Fall in line, soldier. So I hear we're gonna be taking out Separatists. clang! I will be honest. Some of you may not make it back. What-- why is he looking at me? Uh, were you just looking at me? I--I was just kidding. But I have faith in your abilities. You are not ordinary droids. You've worked with the Jedi before. You are our secret weapons. Now, let me turn you over to your mission leader. The colonel is one of our top minds at Strategic Command. He's been with the Republic since the Battle of Geonosis, Colonel Meebur Gascon. boing! Thank you, Master Windu. I'll take it from here. May the Force be with you. Attention! Now, I'm only gonna say this once, so turn up your audio inputs. Once we're inside the cruiser, we make our way to \"C\" deck. That's where their communication center is housed. We bypass security here and here, divert the super battle droids here. Then we break the vault code, beat the swarm mines, steal the encryption module, and return home in time for my promotion ceremony to brigadier general. Are we clear? Uhuh Good, that's what I like: no questions. Oh. D-Squad, fall in line! The line starts behind me, mech. clang! Over here, you mechs, front and center. This is Dr. Gubacher. - He is-- - Uh, uh, Corporal? Colonel. Right. Well, I just want to set the record straight. I am not a mech. You called us all mechs back there, but as you can see, I am a WAC. Granted, my master's not a Jedi, but I am a different class of droid better engineering. As I was saying, before I was rudely interrupted, Dr. Gubacher is going to equip each of you with a tactical upgrade specially designed for this mission. All right, enough with the chatter. Let's get this show on the road. Cyclops, you're not needed here. Go prepare our shuttle for launch. R2-D2, these advanced rocket boosters should give you better aerial mobility and for longer periods of time. Ah, but be advised: the navigation controls are finely tuned. QT-KT, this coil is a remote-controlled magnet. It can attract any metal object in a seven-meter radius. But when dealing with mines, you'll want to take care. The magnetic force is extremely powerful. U9-C4, this laser-cutter will slice through most materials you encounter. But make sure you're in a locked position. The recoil packs quite a wallop. No, no, no, no, no. M5-BZ, we are not putting anything inside you. We're taking something out: your memory banks. I'll be making the extraction myself in the salvage room. I am sorry, but we need to make room for the colonel's command center. No need to baby him. He's just a droid. Fortunately, he won't remember any of this. What do you want, Beezee? It's me, you moron. What are you doing in there, Corporal? And how many times do I have to tell you? It's colonel. Nice setup. I want to know why I did not get an upgrade. Because you are just a pilot! Now do your job and pilot this ship! Just a pilot-- we will see about that. All right, Cyclops, listen up. I want you to alert me when we near the dreadnought. I have a plan on how to attract their attention. Relax. I already took care of it. What do you mean? What did you do? I put us on a collision course with the dreadnought. See, Corporal? I am not just a pilot. You idiot! We're caught in a tractor beam. Hold it right there. Out of the way, tin cans. Let's check the cockpit. No sign of life, just these droids. Continue your search while I take these droids in for interrogation. clang! Everyone just stay calm. Oh, my gosh! You are Republic droids! That is right, and I am their leader. Yeah, I got him. bong! Well, thanks for the assist, Qutee. All right, listen up. The next phase of my plan is to reach \"C\" deck. We'll take this path here. Since the mechs won't draw much attention, we'll go in a convoy. Cyclops, you lead the way. If anyone asks, you're taking the droids on a repair job. Got it? Yes, sir, uh Captain. It's colonel! I swear, Cyclops. You are gonna drive me crazy. Now, I want flat top to locate the comm-vault power supply then use his laser to cut the main line and cause a temporary loss in power. You can do it, Ceefor! Oh, do not forget to lock down your-- Sir, there was a temporary power loss on \"C\" deck. Has the power been reestablished? Yes. It was only a temporary fluctuation. Hmm, curious. All right, listen up. Cutting the power put the comm-vault security system in manual override. But someone still has to distract some super battle droids. Oh, please, please, please. Let me do it, come on, come on, come on, come on, let me do it, please. Come on, come on. All right. You will not regret this, corporal. I am not a Halt. I have been ordered by General Grievous to test comm-vault security. And I need your help. Now, follow me. Now, I will go inside the comm-vault and send out a power surge. I need you two to stay here. It will not be safe for you while I am working. Are we clear? Yes, but-- - Good. That is what I like: no questions. Huh? Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. Shh. Quiet. We need to keep moving. Beezee, open the comm-vault security door. Uh, make sure it is not booby-trapped. clang! You blockhead! Now we're going to lose manual override. Youyou terminated Beezee. It's not my fault he fried his circuitry. I didn't tell that nitwit to attack the access panel. So what do we do now, Corporal? Look, we can still salvage this mission. If one of you could just-- you need to reaccess that panel, and we have to open that comm-vault door fast and grab the encryption module before we're caught red-handed. No, I will not do it myself. I'm an officer. I've got no experience in this type of crisis maneuver. You fought in the Battle of Geonosis. That did not prepare you for a crisis? Well, technically, I didn't fight in that battle. I'm a military analyst by trade and-- - You are a map reader? I am an accomplished battlefield strategist. I analyze the enemy terrain and plot a course to victory. In other words, you read maps. You're off base here, Cyclops! I was chosen for my fearsome cunning, although my size may have played a small factor. But do not think for a moment that Colonel Meebur Gascon is going to relinquish command of this mission. I have waited a lifetime for this opportunity, and some ragtag collection of droids is not going to deny me my destiny. So one way or another, I will open that comm-vault door. Oh, there, just like I planned it. Now, we're going to infiltrate this vault, neutralize the swarm mines, and then secure the encryption module. Any questions? Have you ever been in a battle before? No, I have not. But if you'd care to see what I'm made of, we can go to war right now, you and me, and probably get ourselves captured by a Separatist. Or we can execute my plan and come out of this mission looking like heroes. The choice is yours, Cyclops. First of all, my name is WAC. Second of all, we will execute your plan. But you have to stop calling us stupid names, Shorty. Very well, WAC. I'll play nice, but only until one of you screws up again. Sir, there has been another disturbance on \"C\" deck. I will investigate this situation personally. All right, Pinky-- I mean, Qutee. This is your chance to shine. Use your magnet to attract those swarm mines. There it is, the encryption module. It's all up to you now, Artoo. Not so fast. clang! Arms up. Gravity. pop! Right, turn it off, quick! thud! Ah! I will help you, Corporal. Oh, I'm gonna be sick. Corporal, are you okay? Look out! clang! I will turn the gravity back on. Hurry, WAC, hurry! pop! I'll take that. Ha-ha, good work, Artoo. Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Let's move it out, D-Squad. What are you doing? We're going to get caught! Artoo says we cannot leave Beezee behind. Artoo's right. We can repair him on the shuttle. There's trouble on \"C\" deck. Report there immediately. Get out of the way, you stupid astromechs. Funny thing about droids-- last thing they'd expect to betray them: another droid. D-Squad, let's go home. Ah, my first mission-- a rousing success and a brilliant plan if I do say so myself. I agree, Artoo. The team's execution was not too shabby. Who knows, you droids might just make decent soldiers after all. Oh, and you, too, WAC. Yes, sir, Colonel.   \n                "}, "Destroy Malevolence": {"episode": "s01e04", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tGrievous in retreat! Before the battleship Malevolence could destroy an Outer Rim clone medical base, a Republic strike force, under the command of Jedi Anakin Skywalker, crippled the warship, disabling its dreaded ion cannon. All the Jedi relentlessly persue the Malevolence. Commander, what is the damage level to the enemy ship? She's lost a primary shield and stabilizes. But the ship is so massive, it can take all the fire our cannons can give it. We must summon reinforcements. That's why I'm here, Master Plo. Anakin, were you able to contact Master Luminara? Yes, Master. She's busy with a fleet of separatits reinforcements nearby. She won't be able to give us support until she's turned them away. Then we'll have to make due with what we have. We've lost our primary weapon. The hyperdrive has been disabled. General? General, the forward engines are shutting down. Impossible! - Admiral, status report. - They're not attempting to jump to hyperspace. Their hyperdrive must be damaged. This is our chance. All ships, target the bridge, maximum firepower. It has not sustained extensive damage. General, I have arranged a trap which will give you an advantage over the jedi. I assure you, that is unnecessary. Do not compound your failure this day by allowing our prize warship to fall. My lord, they will never capture me or this ship. Heading towards you is a very important galactic senator. With her as your hostage, they will call off their attack. As you wish, my lord. My lady, are you sure the information from chancellor Palpatine is reliable? Yes, it was secretly given to him by the supreme executive of the banking clan himself. If they leave the separatist alliance, it will go a long way to shortening this war. We're approaching the system now. My goodness! This isn't right! That's a droid warship. We're in the middle of a battle! Sir, we're scanning a small ship off our bow. Good. Our hostage has arrived. Master, I'm picking up a signal near the enemy vessel. Something just came out of hyperspace. - Enemy reinforcements? - No. It looks like a Naboo ship. Gunners, stand down. What in blazes are they doing out here? Ahsoka, contact that ship. - Naboo cruiser, identify yourself. - This is senator Amidala. Padme? What are you doing out here? I was sent on a special mission. The senate was told the banking clan - wanted to negotiate a treaty. - Get out of there as fast as you can. Activate the tractor beam. - Have we been hit? - I'm afraid it's much worse than that. Padme, what's happening? I'm being pulled inside the droid cruiser by a tractor beam. I will not be made a separatist bargaining chip. Continue your attack. You must destroy this monstrous ship! Admiral, order our ships to stop firing. It does not look safe out there, my lady. I see now this whole thing was a trap, and I'm afraid I walked right into it. Sir, the Republic cruisers have halted their attack. Jedi are so predictable. Get the repair team up here. Continue working on the hyperdrive. I'm going down to the main hangar. This ship must be returned to Count Dooku intact. There is no room for failure. Rail jet departing. Come on, I've overloaded the power system. We're doomed. - Where do you think you're going? - Somebody has to save her skin. I thought you might say that. I'm afraid Master Skywalker is taking a terrible risk. You get used to it. Come on, 3PO, hurry. Hurrying, my lady. I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Welcome to rail jet substation 9-4. Mind the gap. Mind the gap. Mind the gap. You two, come with me. Looks like the engines are set to destroy themselves. Get out of my way! Hey, that's just rude! Watch what you're doing with that thing. Sound the alarm! We have stowaways on board. I trust you've already formulated a brilliant plan to rescue the senator. As a matter of fact, I have. But do we have a plan \"B\"? Every operation needs a backup, Anakin. I don't have a backup yet, but I do have a plan for getting on that ship. Really? The enemy sensors are obviously damaged, so we'll sneak in behind them and dock at the emergency airlock. That's your plan? Just fly there, land, hope they don't spot us, and walk in the door? Basically. Brilliant. Let's get going. Pardon me, but might I suggest we keep moving? I think I hear battle droids approaching. But we also need to contact the fleet. If I can just get this comm panel working. My lady, I'm afraid I was right. - General? - What? The damage to the hyperdrive was not as bad as we first thought. We should be able to get under way again shortly. I must inform Count Dooku. Stay here. Continue the search. Find the stowaway and bring them to me. Roger, roger. If they spot us, we'll be pulverized. They're too busy repairing the ship. They don't have time to notice us. Subtlety has never been one of your strong points, Anakin. Everything I know I learned from you, Master. If only that were true. - What was that? - What? That noise. Didn't you hear it? It sounded like a ship docking at one of the emergency airlocks. Your circuits are loose. No one's crazy enough to do that. Anakin, you're crazy. Spinning is not flying. - But it's a good trick. - We do not want to be spotted. - I knew it! It's them! - No. You stay here, R2. Another bold strategy by Skywalker, I presume. - That's my master. - Once they make it off that ship, we'll need reinforcements to finish off the enemy. I am on my way, Master Plo. We're receiving a transmission from inside the Malevolence. I believe it's the senator. Yes. Master, we've found the senator. I'm patching her through. - Padme? - Anakin. Are you all right? Where are you? On the lower levels. I'm fine, but I don't know for how long. - Droids are everywhere. - Obi-Wan and I are on board too. What? What are you doing here? We came to get you off this ship. Ahsoka, how can we get to the senator? According to our scans, there seems to be a larger open area in the center of the ship It should be halfway between the two of you. We're on our way. Did you hear that, Padme? I'll be there. General, we just detected an unauthorized communication - coming from within the ship. - What did it say? Well We don't know. We didn't catch it in time. Monitor all internal communications. I want that senator on this bridge. - I don't see her, Anakin. - She's here, master. I sense it. This is where we're supposed to meet them. He's probably late again. But we do have company of another sort. Blast them! There! Look, Jedi. - Fire! - No, wait. I knew that was a bad idea. Jump! Who, me? Padme!  There they are. Fire! - The bridge is out. - Jump to me. You have to trust me. - I've got you. - Nice catch. I'll fetch the droid. The things you do to get me alone. Stop talking. What is going on? Stop me, please! Blast, that's not good. Anakin, I got separated from your droid. I'll take care of it. - We'll meet you back at the Twilight. - No, we can't leave yet. I overheard Grievous. Their hyperdrive is almost repaired. I'm already headed in that direction, so I'll make certain that the hyperdrive stays offline. We'll see about that, Jedi. Come with me. I'm getting you out of here. R2, I need you to help me find 3PO. He's on the rail jet. I know. I know. He does. Look, just find him for me, and I'll be there soon. Someone stop this contraption, please! I suppose I did ask for that. Hello, there. General Kenobi, did you really think I would leave the hyperdrive unguarded? Anything is possible. You haven't exactly impressed me today. Kill him. That was impressive. Guard the hyperdrive! I will deal with this Jedi myself! Obi-Wan? Come in, Obi-Wan. Anakin, I'm afraid Grievous is on to us. Yeah, we noticed. We'll rendezvous back at the Twilight. The fleet must engage the Obi-Wan? Come in. Obi-Wan! - What's wrong? - They're jamming us. - That might buy us some time. - I suppose you have a plan. Follow me. I do believe I'm lost in enemy territory and all alone. Don't shoot! I surrender! R2-D2, my you are a sight for short circuits. Master Anakin sent you to find me? What kept you then? The General is demanding a status report. Is the hyperdrive repaired yet? It's almost done. I'll give him the good news. Ever since I've known you, you've been playing with droids. I used to put them together. Now I only take them apart. So where do we start? First we need to get rid of these droids so they won't know we were here. I'm gonna hotwire the ship, give Grievous a little surprise. I guess I'll clean up the droids then. Our ships are in attack position. Any word from master Skywalker? No, the droids are jamming our transmissions. We need to give him more time. I'm not sure we can. That ought to do it. How's the housecleaning going? Done. Let's get out of here. I guess repairs are finished. - Prepare to charge up the hyperdrive. - Roger, roger. R2, are you quite certain the ship is in this direction? This way looks potentially dangerous. I know the whole place is dangerous! I suggest we stay here and let master Anakin find us. Don't just stand there. Let's get back to the ship. - Power up the engines, R2. - Hold the ship! I'll contact the fleet. R2, release the docking clamp. - Time for some clever tricks, Anakin. - That's what I was thinking. All batteries, open fire! You know, we have guns. You can shoot back any time. - I was just about to - I got it. She seems to know her way around. General, the hyperdrive has been completely repaired. - Should we retreat to friendly space? - Engage the hyperdrive. I'll meet you at our secret base in sector four. You heard the General. Prepare to make the jump to hyperspace. Yes, Sir. - Nice shot, senator. - Beginner's luck. Pardon me, Sir, but R2's scan of the enemy's ship indicates their hyperdrive is activating. - Don't worry about it. - What? Coordinates are locked. Hyperdrive is engaging. I think we have a problem. General, there's something wrong with the hyperdrive. I thought the hyperdrive was fixed. The navicomputer is heading us right into the moon! Fools, reset the navicomputer! Quick, reset the navicomputer! General, we await the Malevolence at the rendezvous point. Have you made your escape yet? No, reset it General? General? Transmission has been cut off, Sir. I think the General did it himself. We're gonna die! Abandon ship! I imagine you had something to do with that. All part of the plan, Master. Next, all new Star Wars: The Clone Wars Nothing going on. As usual. Landed on the most boring post, in the Outer Rim. - And one of the most important. - What the It's an ambush! Send the alarm! This way, hurry! We have to retake this base.

Desperate took free her people, Duchess Satine has asked a friend Padme Amadala to speak with the Jedi Council. in hopes that they would send a systems to our struggling world. The Jedi Council's given you a mission Asoka. It' your duty to see it through. Don't you think I'm just a little overqualified for this. According to senator Amidala, Mandalore is a deeply corrupt world. If the cycle is to be broken, the future leaders at the Royal Academy of government must learn the evils of corruption. Yoda feels that only a young Padawan like you can get through to them. My lady, if I may, what do The jedi know of our ways? Do we really want them meddling With our children's education? Surely there is nothing to Fear from exposing them to new Ideas, prime minister. Duchess Satine. Prime minister almec. Master Skywalker, so good to See you again. This is your padawan, I assume. Yes, my lady. May I present Ahsoka Tano? Duchess. Prime minister. I am grateful that the jedi Council could spare the two of You to help instruct our leaders And peacekeepers of tomorrow. Please thank master yoda for me. Our limited resources, I must Return to battle immediately. So you will not be staying, Master Skywalker? No, but I assure you, padawan Tano is a highly capable jedi And has the full confidence of the council. Very well. Cadet Korkie, amis, lagos. These are some of the cadets That you will be instructing, Padawan Tano. That's a fine weapon. May I see it? I'm afraid not. Because of master Kenobi's Recent visit and the trouble That followed, no offworlders May carry weapons on Mandalore. Master Obi-Wan caused Trouble? That's a first. Just give me the lightsaber. Thank you for respecting our Ways, master jedi. Excuse the interruption, sir, But it is time to depart. General Fisto is expecting us. If you'll excuse me. Corruption is what happens When someone in power puts their Interests of the people they Represent. So it's a result of greed? Yes. A leader sacrifices moral Integrity for the sake of money or power. Entire star systems have Collapsed into chaos or Revolution because their greedy Politicians got caught up in a Cycle of bribery and blackmail While their people suffered. Does that mean most Government officials are corrupt? Well No, but the point is That temptation is always there, And citizens must be vigilant So corruption can't take root. The deadliest enemies of a Society dwell within its Borders, and from these internal Threats, the people need to be protected. But if you don't trust your Leaders, isn't that treason? It's every citizen's duty to Challenge their leaders, to keep Them honest, and hold them Accountable if they're not. How do you do that? By exposing corrupt officials For what they are.

Yeah, down at the government Warehouse. Someone just let you in to Inspect the warehouse? No, we broke in. Oh, great! So you committed a crime. It sounds bad, I know, but Then we saw a meeting and Offworlders And they chased us. Maybe they chased you because You broke into a government Warehouse. No, it was a black market Deal. I know it.

You're all under arrest for Treason, corruption, and conspiracy. You will come with us. These are the same guards we Saw last night. We've done nothing wrong. Looks like the prime minister Set you up. That's treason. He's the leader of our system. He couldn't possibly be a traitor. We need proof. We have the recording. That's no good. You can't see who it is. Wait. Stop right there. Information retrieval. I need you to I.D. a hologram. That's him! You're right. That is the prime minister. We have to take this to my Aunt and warn her. They know I talked to her. We're too late. He's dead. Korkie, wait. The intruders may still be inside. They took her. This is all my fault. Who knows what they've done to her. Now what? How are we supposed to find her? Who can we trust? I need all of you to calm Down and focus. We know the prime minister is Behind this. After my aunt, he's the most Powerful person on Mandalore. So let's go talk to him. Master jedi, this is an Unexpected pleasure. What can I do for you? Actually, prime minister, It's what I can do for you. I believe some of my students Are involved in a conspiracy Against you. Intriguing. You can't do this! We trusted you, master Tano. Thank you for bringing the Traitors to justice, master jedi. They mentioned that duchess Satine was their leader. We should arrest her too. Do not worry. We already have her in custody. Really? Where? That is none of your concern. Now, I must prepare a public Statement about the duchess and Her crimes. Officer, I need to Interrogate the prisoners Immediately. Careful. We're being watched. Did he buy it? Have you found my aunt? Not exactly, but I know they Have her in custody. Where? The prime minister wouldn't Tell me. I knew this plan wouldn't work. Have a little faith. I'll find her. We'll just modify the plan a bit. How are you going to do that? Don't worry. You'll know when to act when I Give the signal. What's the signal? You'll know it when you see it. You will take me to duchess Satine. I will take you to duchess Satine. What are you doing? I must interrogate the duchess. You must interrogate the duchess. I'm getting you out of here. Ahsoka, it's a trap. I see you found the duchess, youngling. You may stop your playacting Now, sergeant. Prime minister, sir! Using a jedi mind trick was a Very poor decision. My guards have been trained to Resist such archaic magic. And now you have revealed Yourself as a conspirator. Set for stun. You little fool. Where is she? Stick to Ahsoka's plan. But how dwe do that? It's falling apart. Ahsoka wants us to wait for a Signal, and that's what we're Going to do. Sigit. Sign the confession and admit to Your treasonous ways. There is only one traitor to Mandalore here, prime minister, And that's you. You control the black market. You have betrayed the public Trust and used your office to Accumulate wealth and power. It's shameful. Your idealism is inspiring, my Dear, but hopelessly naive. I established the black market For the people. That's absurd. The war is disrupting trade Across the galaxy. The profits from the black Market are being used to Purchase humanitarian supplies for Mandalore. Think of it as a new tax in the Interest of national security. It's a tax for your benefit, Prime minister. Where are these humanitarian Supplies you speak of? Sergeant, put the shock Collar on her. My patience has worn thin, Duchess. Maybe this will convince you. I would rather die than sign Your confession. That can be arranged. You're wasting your time. Bring me those traitorous Cadets. No, you can't. They're just children. All right, let's move. I'm afraid your nephew will Have to suffer needlessly. Put the shock collar on cadet Korkie. Go! Got ya. Send for my personal guards. You must know by now that I Didn't bring you here just to teach. I knew something was amiss, but I had no one to trust. I thought if I brought a jedi, Especially a friend of senator Amidala's, we could solve this Mystery together. I never doubted you, duchess. Neither did we. It was an honor to serve with a jedi knight. It was my privilege to be your teacher. I hope this assignment wasn't Too boring for you. Ah, it had its moments. Huh, like the one where you Convinced untrained children to Help you overthrow a corrupt Government? That was a highlight. It sounds pretty risky. You're lucky you didn't get hurt. Nothing you wouldn't have done.   \n                "}, "Prisoners": {"episode": "s04e03", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tA last gasp of hope! After the assassination of his father and the fall of his kingdom beneath a planetary civil war, Mon Cala Prince Lee-Char has gone into hiding with Padawan Ahsoka Tano as his only protector. With his armies captured and friends imprisoned, the situation seems hopeless for the prince. Count Dooku commands his sinister agent Riff Tamson to use any means necessary to bring Prince Lee-Char out of hiding, for he knows that hope does remain as long as the prince is alive. A senator, two Jedi Knights, and a fumbling amphibian. I would have thought the prince would be easier to capture than the four of you. It must be part of our plan. I had the exact same thought. - Don't touch me. - Let go of her. Rack 'em up! No! Mesa don't like this. Ow! That pinching! Tamson, leave them alone. Do not worry, Jedi, there's plenty of suffering to go around. Ah. Eels, very dangerous. Now, tell me, where is Prince Lee-Char? We can't hide forever. The Gungan Army was the last of the Republic's reinforcements. There won't be any more. The failure is mine, not the Republic's. Get back! If my father were here, he could unite with Nossor Ri and the Quarren. The Quarren and Mon Cala have always had a difficult relationship, but it was respectful, until Riff Tamson arrived. Once that Carcadon got inside Nossor Ri's head the alliance between the Mon Cala and the Quarren fell apart. I know what I must do. The Mon Cala and Quarren people must be reunited. Okay. I like your thinking, but what's the strategy? Count all the prisoners, Mon Cala, Gungans, clones. If we all fought together we would outnumber our opponent. If this is going to work, we'll need to let your people know. They'll have to be ready to fight. We need Captain Ackbar and I think I know where to find him. I have interrogated the Jedi, My Lord, but they will not give up the whereabouts of the prince. The Jedi's resistance to pain is impressive. Press the interrogation, Tamson. We cannot allow the prince to survive. The royal bloodline must be broken. Count Dooku, is this necessary? The battle is won. The prince has no army to rally. Now is the time for the Quarren to take the lead - and think of rebuilding. - Rebuild? While this battle has been won, there is still a war going on, Senator Ri. A war in which you pledged your allegiance to the Separatist cause! Of course, Count, we owe you everything. Do not soon forget it. Tamson, have your soldiers arrived? - Soldiers? - Yes, Count. We now have the city under our control. Good. Continue as planned. It's a prison camp. How can we be sure Captain Ackbar is inside? There's only one way to find out. Will we ever get out of here? The city is fallen, prince is lost. Prince Lee-Char? Are you a prisoner here as well? I am here, but not as a prisoner. I've come with a message. As your future king, I have not lost hope. The time is coming when you will be free again. I will not fail you. We want to believe, but how can this be possible? - Commander Tano. - Monnk, am I glad to see you. Yes, Commander, but you both must come with me now. You'll attract too much attention here, and I think there's someone who'll be happy to see you. Prince! You can't leave us here. Have courage. The next time I appear to you, I will appear as your king. I grow tired of waiting, Jedi. - Where is the prince? - Even if we knew, we would not say. Unfortunate. To be honest, it matters little to me. I would torture you either way, but Count Dooku insists I capture the prince. And there is the slight chance you're deceiving me and holding back some information I could use. And in my position, I cannot afford to take chance! No! Time is of the essence. Now tell me what I want to know. You're alive. Captain, you were right. Prince, I knew you would survive the battle. Captain, I need your help. I have a plan. I know how we can win this fight. But the battle is over, young Prince. And it appears that we have lost. No. In truth, we now outnumber our enemy. We can overwhelm them. But we are prisoners. If we revolted thousands would die. Not if the Quarren struck first and aided in our attack. Prince, how can you say this? The Quarren betrayed us. They assassinated your father! No, Captain, Riff Tamson murdered my father. Of that, I am sure. The Quarren are being used, I've seen it happen before. Count Dooku has deceived them. The prince is right. Riff Tamson murdered my father. We'll find Nossor Ri. He was my father's friend. I know he will listen. - How can you be certain of this? - I can't, but it's time for me to lead. And this, I feel, is my only course of action. - I will ready our people, Prince. - But, Captain, you're injured. I'll be ready to fight with our future king. I'll marshal the remaining clones and Gungans. What will your signal be? When a Quarren attacks our enemy, that will be your sign. You are under arrest. No, stay your blade, my friend. I am Lee-Char, leader of the Mon Cala people, and I demand to speak to your superiors. Your friend's time is running short. I'm beginning to believe you're both telling the truth, and know nothing about the prince's whereabouts. - Yes. We have located the prince and have him in custody. He has requested an audience with the leadership. By all means, bring him to me. I shall meet you in the throne room. Roger, roger. The throne room? Yes. I want that little one to see me in my rightful place as ruler of this world. Ruler? That was not our arrangement with Count Dooku. No, it wasn't your arrangement. It was mine! Wait! The prisoner! You have to save her! - No, I don't. - Tamson Ani, mesa have an idea. Not now, Jar Jar. We need to save Padm\u00c3\u00a9. Anakin, we must create a bubble for her to breathe from. Use the Force to push the water away from her helmet. I'm on it. It's working! It's working! Look out! Jar Jar? - Padm\u00c3\u00a9! I'm sorry I couldn't - I'm here. Jar Jar sealed my helmet with his Yesa. It's Gungan waterproofing. It's why wesa swim so good. Greetings, Prince. We meet again. I must admit you were more difficult to capture than I anticipated, Prince. You have my respect as hunter to his prey. I do not seek, nor do I want your respect. I have come to demand the freedom of my people. Your people? You're mistaken, Prince. They are my people and under my rule. They, like you, are nothing more than slaves. Your rule is not recognized here, Tamson. My people are all those who live in these seas, whether they be Mon Cala or Quarren. Surely you have not come here seeking the aid of Nossor Ri. Do you really think he would trade his position to join you? The Quarren are already slaves, though they may not see it. Nossor Ri, you knew my father. Whatever differences our people had in the past, surely you must know we can work together to make Mon Cala whole. Dooku and Tamson want only to exploit us, and leave our cities broken and our resources depleted. What will then be left for the Quarren? Well, Nossor Ri, would you like to join this pitiful little fish and his dead father? There, you see. What good will their help be anyway, Prince? The Quarren are more gutless than your people. As long as I live, I shall give all people of Mon Cala hope to fight another day. Hmm. Hope? We are of the same mind, Prince. That is why I have scheduled your public execution. Take him away! Nossor Ri, there's still time! Unite and we will defend our home. All right, I think I'm getting the hang of this. Less talking helps. Jar Jar, I can't see anything. Where are they taking us? Hey, yousa. Where yousa taking us? To the execution of Prince Lee-Char. Good job protecting the prince. It's all part of the plan, Master. I was hoping you were going to say that. Anything I can do? Unfortunately, this time it's out of our hands. I'm not sure I like this plan after all. For crimes against the Separatist state, I command the execution of former Prince Lee-Char. Captain, Nossor Ri and the Quarren are with you. Kill him! Fight, Quarren! Fight for Prince Lee-Char! - Send in more droids! - Roger, roger. Look out! Prince Lee-Char. Your rule is at an end before it started, Tamson! I killed your father without pity or mercy. Then I'll return the favor! The day is won! Long live the prince! Long live the prince! Long live the prince! Long live the prince! Your father would be so proud. I know. May the blessings of the water keep you. The might of your ancestors, give you strength. As representative of the Quarren people, I pledge our loyalty to you. And as your king, I pledge my loyalty to all people of Mon Cala. I present King Lee-Char! Long live the king! Long live King Lee-Char! Long live the king! Long live King Lee-Char!   \n                "}, "Supply Lines": {"episode": "s03e03", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tWhere there's a will, there's a way. A world under siege! The Separatists have launched a massive offensive against the planet Ryloth. A blockade of deadly battleships, has cut off any support for the dwindling Republic defenses. Though they have fought Valiantly with the help of Twi'lek, freedom fighter Cham Syndulla, Hold his faith in jedi master Di and his men, as the droid Army closes in. Master jedi, We're running out of food and water, and our heavy weapon systems are out of power. I'll contact our forces in orbit. Admiral Dao, this is general Di. We're in trouble down here. We need those supplies Immediately. I understand, general, but I Am in no position to help. We are critically low on fuel and ammunition. Contact the jedi Council again! Tell them reinforcements must be dispatched without delay! If help does not arrive soon, The entire outer rim garrison will be wiped out. Surely there must be something you can do The main reactor's been hit, sir. Systems are shutting down. We are dead in space. With regret, I report that my fleet will no longer be able to provide protection for the troops on Ryloth. I repeat my request that help be sent right away. The shields are gone. We have no Trapped on Ryloth, Master Di and his men are. My trade mission was successful, thank you for asking. But what's the matter? You all look very somber. Senator, the fleet protecting Ryloth has been destroyed, and the supply lines have been cut the troops are out of food, fuel, ammunition. And the civilian population is starving. That is grim news. Our blockade runners should be able to penetrate the Separatist lines and drop Relief supplies. But they do not have the range to reach Ryloth. The planet Toydaria is 2,000 parsecs closer than the nearest fleet. If the blockade runners can supply from there, they might Reach Ryloth in time. What would you have me do? We've dispatched a ship loaded with relief supplies to meet you on Toydaria. You are a more experienced diplomat than the representative from naboo who is already there. Senator amidala is an excellent negotiator. - I am sure - Senator amidala could not leave the senate. Representative Binks accompanied the shipment. You must negotiate the treaty That we can dispatch ships from Toydaria and get Ryloth the relief supplies it needs. I understand perfectly. This had better be important. Sir, we intercepted a coded transmission between senator Organa, and the jedi council. We were able to partially unscramble it. The jedi have sent senator Organa to Toydaria to negotiate a treaty which would allow them to send relief supplies to their forces on Ryloth. Send a message to senator lott dod of the trade federation. I wish to speak with him immediately. Stop where you are, offworlder. We will provide you whatever you need to continue your journey, But you may not leave the ship. I am senator bail Organa of the galactic republic. I come to speak with the high exalted king of Toydaria. Hi-Lo! Let meesa through. Meesa on a diplomatic mission. Senator Organa! It's a pleasure to be Seeing yousa. And you, Representative Binks. Shall we? Our laws of hospitality demand that we offer assistance, But this planet is closed to offworlders. We are obliged to deliver our message to your king in person. It won't take a minute. H-Lo? Yousa majesty? Let me do the talking, okay? State your business, offworlders. Representative Binks Of naboo. Senator bail Organa of Alderaan, sire. We have come to ask for your help. Perhaps you failed to pay attention to the senate orientation. They should have explained that Toydaria is a neutral system. We are not part of the republic. Yes, your majesty. That is why we have come before you as friends. There is a humanitarian crisis on Ryloth. Millions will be starvin' and dyin' without your help. My esteemed colleague and I Humbly beg that you allow us to use Toydaria as a staging ground to supply the planet with relief aid. Do not make your decision in, your majesty. There are other factors you might wish to consider. I believe you know lott dod, Senator for the trade Federation. Yes, we are acquainted. Senator. Beggin' your highness, what'sa he doing here? Why shouldn't he be? Toydaria has an important contract with his trade federation. The trade federation is too chummy with the separatists for my taste. We have nothing to do with the separatists! Nute gunray is an extremist. His views do not reflect those of the trade Federation. Perhaps not. But you can understand the confusion. We are only here to ensure that nothing jeopardizes the agreement between Toydaria and the trade federation. Naboo and alderaan have a long tradition of providing humanitarian aid. - I see no reason for conflict. - Nor do I. The people of Ryloth are suffering, And compassion is a sacred Toydarian value. Honesty is also a Toydarian value, is it not? I'm sure the senator mentioned the separatists blockade around Ryloth. A blockade? Is this true? Yes, your majesty. But it changes nothing. Inconceivable! It changes everything. If the separatist are blockading the planet and we help the republic it will destroy our neutrality. I must convene my ministers, then we shall hear your arguments. General Di, the right flank has collapsed. The droids will be closing in on our position. What about reinforcements? Communication has been spotty. I promise you, Cham, the republic will not abandon Ryloth. I've heard enough of your promises, jedi. The fact remains: If we stay here without reinforcements, we're all going to die. Gobi, tell the people we're leaving. - Yes, sir. - I don't think you Understand. The right flank has collapsed. There's no leaving. We're stuck here together. We will now hear arguments in the matter of using Toydarian territory to aid the shipment of relief supplies to the citizens of Ryloth. Senator Organa. Thank you, your majesty. The operation the republic Humanitarian. We wish to deliver food and medical supplies to the people of Ryloth. But if you won't listen to me, wise king, listen to senator Orn Free Taa of Ryloth, who is well aware of the suffering of his people. Your highness, our cities lie in ruins. Our transportation hubs are all but destroyed, So I cannot return home. Our crops burn. The twi'lek people are starving. And they will die if no aid comes to them. I appeal to you, great king. This is a crisis of planetary proportions. We cannot let them starve. The basic tenets of our morality and even our constitution demand that we help those in need. Those ideals are noble, but we must be careful that our compassion doesn't draw us into this war Senator dod, if you please. Great king, senator Organa is deceiving you. The inconvenient fact remains that this is a war, and Ryloth is a battlefield. The planet is under a separatist blockade because jedi knights and clone soldiers, Are battling the droid army for control of the surface. This will not be a humanitarian base. It will be a military base. The separatist senate will see it as a violation of your neutrality. That in turn will expose the trade federation's ships to attacks from the separatists and force us to cease trade with Toydaria, a situation desirable to no one. We cannot How it might effect Our economy. Your majesty. The people of Ryloth didn't ask to be invaded. Do not let them suffer because war came to them. I sympathize with the plight of the twi'leks. But this is not about saving them, when they are fighting against the separatists. Thank you, senators. You have given us much to consider. I will summon you once I have made my decision. Come on. Hurry, hurry! Captain, Is the gunship ready? Yes, sir. But it's too small to evacuate the refugees. No escape? But our families are with us. If we reconfigure the fuel system, we can turn the ship Into a bomb big enough to collapse the pass here. The enemy will then only be able to engage us, on one front from this ravine. While we provide cover, The twi'leks will have time to escape with their families over the mountain. Brilliant strategy, general. I'll go tell the men. After considerable debate, I have made my decision. I am sorry, senator Organa. But for the sake of my people, Toydaria must remain neutral. A wise ruling, your majesty. That did not go well. - What are weesa gonna do now? - My friends. Toydaria cannot turn a blind eye to the suffering of Ryloth. The twi'leks are innocent victims caught between the warring factions through no fault of their own. I'm glad you agree, Your highness. What are you prepared to do? You may use Toydaria to transfer the supplies you brought with you. One, maybe two rotations. It will have to do. And you must guarantee that the trade federation will not be able to link toydaria to the mission. Agreed. I have an idea. I'll signal you when the ships are ready to depart. Meesa won't let you down, senator. We're pleased you could join us, senator. Your majesty. The pleasure is mine. Formal dinners are so tedious. I am afraid that, pressing matters require me to make immediate contact with Alderaan But I leave you in the capable hands of my colleague, Representative Binks. General, we're loading the rest of the explosives onto the gunship. Very good, captain. Ready the men. All units: Prepare for attack! We won't be able to hold off the droids for long. You'll have to move quickly to get your families out of danger. Cham is still angry. He feels betrayed. We counted on republic Assistance, and it didn't come. War turns promises into hopes. I wish it wasn't so. Tell him. I will. Captain keeli, tell the pilots to move the gunship into position. This is command. Are all the charges in place? Copy that. We're all ready. The droid army is closing. As soon as they're in range, blow up the gunship. There is a gunship blocking our way. Om-5, om-7, go check it out. Careful, it might be full of clones. No clones. Just explosives. Explosives? Gotcha. Halt, halt! We cannot get through. We will have to find another way around. Move those supplies into the transport as soon as possible. Repeat, the ships are ready to launch. Lookie, lookie! Meesa proposing a conceptual ambassador of trade federation. let's see. I'll take that one. Just give me. Are you done with that? That's really good. I heard toydarians really like that, but I'm taking it. Thank you very much. Did you enjoy that? Did you like that one? Excuse me. Thank you. I'll take that. Gentlemen and gentlemen. Here's a try this one. You thought I was going to drop I, here we go. One, two, three! There is conceptual art piece. Thank you. Meesa just sharing my gungan art with yousa and And meesa. What are you looking at? Meesa look at nothing! At nothing. Meesa creating and sharing gungan ritual style art with trade federation To promote love and understanding. Steady. Remember, we have to buy as much time for the twi'leks as possible. Yes, sir. For the republic! For the twi'leks! I'm not finished yet, sir. We can do this, general. Well, let's make the end memorable. This is republic blockade runner oh-Niner-Niner. We have broken through. The twi'leks will live to fight another day. The supplies have arrived at the drop point. It's food and medical supplies from the republic. Safe journey, my friends. I hope when we meet again it is under more pleasant circumstances. Stop right there. You look pale, senator. I have just received Information that a fleet of Republic ships has penetrated the blockade around Ryloth. If the trade federation has proof of any treaty violation, welcome to present it to the full senate. It takes years for the Senate to decide anything. You play a dangerous game, Organa. Next time, you will not get away with this. The republic has heart, My friend. But I am not convinced it has the strength to prevail. However, after what I witnessed here today, perhaps it is time I reconsidered our neutrality. Tell the jedi I am open to meeting with them. Master Yoda will be glad to hear it. For now, at least, The people of Ryloth shall endure.   \n                "}, "Voices": {"episode": "s06e11", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\t6x11 - \"Voices\"  Jedi mystery! A lightsaber was found on the moon of Oba Diah, belonging to Sifo-Dyas, a Jedi responsible for the creation of the clone army. The Jedi have learned that before the start of the war Count Dooku murdered Sifo-Dyas and skillfully manipulated the Republic into the galactic conflict, intending for the Jedi to fight with the clones at their side. Now as the Jedi Council meets to discuss the purpose of this deception, Master Yoda meditates deep into the Force in search of answers. Yoda Hear you I do. Who are you? My imagination it must be. No. It is I, Qui-Gon Jinn. That cannot be. Dead you are. No. I am part of the Living Force, Yoda. Impossible. I am not sure this Council is admitting how grave a situation we are in. What are you saying? That Dooku is not the Sith Lord; merely an apprentice. That, like many things, remains unclear. Master Yoda, your thoughts on these revelations? Hmm? Oh, oh, yes, yes. Forgive me, deep in thought I was. You were saying? Master Ki-Adi-Mundi is worried. Yes, worried we all should be. Lies and mistrust surround us in the Senate, and perhaps even within these walls. Hmm. On the precipice we are, yes. The growing dark side endangers us all. Excuse me, everyone. Master Kenobi, may I speak with you in private? Of course. There is great turmoil within Master Yoda. Yes, we all sensed it. For something to affect Yoda this deeply concerns me. We must keep an eye on our old friend. The war has taxed all of us to our limit. I suppose we're just surprised that Master Yoda has one. I hope it's that simple, but I feel the shadow of something greater on our horizon. Yoda. Oh! Master Yoda. Sorry, I didn't see you there. Is everything okay? Encountered something difficult, I have. Difficult? For you, Master? Spoke with Master Qui-Gon Jinn on Mortis did you not? Yes So did Obi-Wan. However, since he's dead, we don't think it was actually him. Rather an illusion A mind trick formed out of our memories. That's what Obi-Wan believes Why do you ask? Perhaps nothing it is. Everything that we know about the Force tells us that an individual retaining their identity after death is impossible. Everything that we know, yes. But what about what we know not? Hmm? Master Yoda, are you suggesting that you have spoken with Master Qui-Gon? Suggest this I am not. Rest I need. Yes, rest. Then speak with the Council I shall. Sense something that I have not before. Impossible it seems. Trust my feelings, I do not. The voice I hear does not come from within but speaks from beyond. Know I must if I am alone, or if any of you can hear it as well. Then together we shall meditate. Hmm. Hear the voice I did not. I also sensed nothing. Answers we will not find. Tired I am. Rest I must. We have to consider that this may be a deception by the Sith. Surely you're not suggesting Master Yoda is susceptible to such manipulation. Master Yoda, you are older and wiser than any living Jedi, but this does not mean you are beyond the corruption of the dark side. Agree I do. A possibility we must consider it is. Clouded so much of our vision the dark side has, deceived I may be. All I can tell you is, I have scanned Master Yoda three times and I find nothing wrong with him. I am not an expert on his biology, but from my point of view, he is in perfect health. And his mind? No signs of any degeneration. This section of the brain is particularly active, more than I have seen in any other Jedi. Probably what happens when you approach 900 years old. I think we are overlooking an obvious thread. Which is Count Dooku was Yoda's apprentice, and Count Dooku has fallen to the dark side. All of us have apprenticed to Master Yoda. He cannot be held accountable for Dooku's descent. But they are connected, profoundly. Whoever the Sith Lord is, he may be using this relationship as a direct link to Yoda. Impossible. Are you so sure? If the Sith Lord wanted to attack the Jedi Order from within, Master Yoda would be the perfect choice. I fear we are more vulnerable than we think. I would like to suggest something: a deprivation ritual. It is a dangerous procedure but one that will without question allow Yoda to go to the source of this voice whatever, whoever it may be. I'm sorry to bother you, but the Chancellor's requesting that Master Yoda attend an emergency meeting. I will go. What about the treatment? Ask Master Yoda what he wants to do. Only he can decide now. The chamber works to deprive the patient of any stimulation except from within. Master Yoda will be taken into an induced meditation. This allows the patient to go deeper than anything we can achieve by ourselves. Master Yoda, you don't have to do this. Solve this puzzle I will. But it could be more dangerous than you realize. The danger is not to know the truth. See clearly I must. Help this will. Life signs are normal. Beginning the procedure What are you doing? By reducing the flow of oxygen, the body will be forced into a deep meditative state. It will take him as close to death as possible. I don't like this.  Yoda. No, this is not the way. Come to Dagobah. The answers you seek are here. But why? You must complete what I could not. His vital signs are dropping too low. - But the test. - I want him out of there now! Master Yoda! Master Yoda, wake up! Come back to us! Speak of this to no one. Trust no one. Come to Dagobah alone. Master Yoda. Master Yoda, wake up! Welcome back, old friend. Thought we lost you there. Speaking to the dead I was, friends long gone. Good friends. How did the procedure go? We're not certain. Yoda seems to be under the impression he contacted the dead and spoke with them. What are your thoughts on this, Doctor? Medically Yoda seems fine, but I cannot speak to his spiritual balance. What Yoda claims is not possible. As far as we know. The dead are part of the Cosmic Force and lose their individuality. I fear Yoda is under attack by the Sith, though how remains unknown to us. Until what's going on is clear, I want temple guards placed in the medical bay. I am prescribing nothing but bed rest for you now, Master Yoda. I will leave you two alone. You asked for me, Master? Yes. Friends, we are? Hmm? Of course. A choice you must make. Worried for you I am. Why is that? Do for me something you must. Blamed you will be. What? What must I do? Help me to escape. Yes. Escape? But you're not in prison. No, perhaps, but perhaps I am. Already, all around us the cage may be. A journey I must make alone. The Council will not want you to travel at all, alone even less. Disobeying the Council your expertise is. That is why I ask for your help. It is the spontaneity you find so easily which others do not. That is what sets you apart. Now, a walk you will take me on. Come, come. Where are you going? Some fresh air I require. It's okay. He's with me. I'll watch him. I hope I don't regret this. Hey, Artoo, I have a mission for you. Doctor Nema is gonna notice Yoda is missing any minute now. Get him to his ship as fast as possible and get him out of here. Where's Master Yoda? What have you done? Hey, for once, none of this was my idea. Yes, stay with the ship you may. This task, for me alone it is. Here I am. Ready for my next instruction, Master Qui-Gon.  Yoda, my old friend, you have come at last. Qui-Gon Jinn. Really you, it is? It is. Losing my mind I am not?  No, my friend. No. Why have you brought me here? Follow the light. The light will be your guide. Strong this planet is with the Force. It is one of the purest places in the galaxy. How are you here? I am a manifestation of the Force, a Force that consists of two parts. Living beings generate the Living Force, which in turn powers the wellspring that is the Cosmic Force. Show yourself, can you?  I cannot. My training was incomplete. All energy from the Living Force from all things that have ever lived, feeds into the Cosmic Force, binding everything and communicating to us through the midi-chlorians. Because of this I can speak to you now. See the future, you can?  I exist where there is no future or past. Know you who the Sith Lord is? I can only show you a place where the answers will be revealed to you. Be wary. Give power to that which you fear, and it will show itself to you. No! No. No. You will die. Sidious. Sidious. Sidious. Join me. There is no other way. No. No! Yoda. Come back to us. Yoda. Such darkness. Such evil. When will this happen? It is happening right now. It has always been happening. With each day the Clone War wages, evil is growing in its power. What you felt in the cave is merely a portion of what the dark side now holds. Such power. Any hope that the Jedi can prevail is there? There is always hope, my friend, though it often comes in forms not looked for. The key is knowing how to see it and seizing that opportunity. I have been tasked with guiding you forward. There can be many outcomes, but your path is clear, Yoda. You have been chosen, as I was before you. For what chosen am I? You will learn to preserve your Life Force, and so, manifest a consciousness which will allow you to commune with the living after death. How? Dark times are ahead, and forces of light must remain. This is the path of only a few Jedi. You will travel to one of the origins of all life in the galaxy. This place is where? The Force will be your guide. Good-bye, my friend. Yes, my friend. All right I am. No, back to Coruscant we are not going yet. Afraid only begun our long journey has.   \n                "}, "The General": {"episode": "s04e08", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tTurning the tide! As Separatist control over vital but isolated supply routes expands, Republic forces invade a key planet, the darkened world of Umbara. In the midst of helping Obi-Wan Kenobi's battalion conquer the Umbaran capital, Anakin Skywalker is called away to Coruscant. His battalion is temporarily placed under the command of Jedi General Pong Krell, a shrewd and temperamental leader. Krell's reckless strategy forced Captain Rex to retreat with his platoons in a disastrous defeat. We have got to move before those fighters come back. Rex! Rex, over here! Jesse, take the right flank. Dogma, take the left flank. It'll be okay, buddy. This will ease the pain. The capital city's too fortified. We need your battalion to help us take it. Resistance from the Umbarans has been greater than anticipated. We're holding our ground at the moment. We've gathered intel on an airbase to the west. It is re-supplying the capital's defenses. Incoming! Incoming! Get down, get down! If you could capture that airbase, it will sever the capital's supply lines allowing the rest of our forces to move in. I'll see to it that the airbase is placed under our control. Remember, General Krell, the entire invasion depends on your battalion. Captain Rex, have those coordinates mapped and all troops ready to move out immediately! Yes, General! There's a base there, all right, and it's heavily guarded. At least three tank divisions, plus guns. We'll advance along the central gorge and engage their forces in a full-forward assault. The gorge is narrow, sir. We'll only be able to move our platoons in single squads. Perhaps a closer recon will tell us if there's a more secure route. Obi-Wan and the other battalions are holding off the enemy right now while they wait for us to take out this base. We don't have time to look for a more secure route. Yes, sir. All right, listen up. We'll assemble the squads into two divisions. We'll move straight up this gorge towards the airbase at the far side. The casualties are going to be high. Is Krell trying to get us killed? You know, I wasn't sure that Krell was crazy before, but now I'm positive. We had to retreat from the capital because the General pushed a flawed strategy. Now this? I don't know! Could be fun. Well, I, for one, agree with the General's plan. We're running out of time and this is the best option. No recon? No air support? We don't know what we're up against. They have weapons we've never seen before. A few of General Skywalker's plans seemed reckless, too, but they worked. Yeah, but General Skywalker is usually leading his men up in the front not bringing up the rear like General Krell. A full-forward assault would leave us too exposed. We have to look at other options. - It's going to be a meat grinder. - Fives. It would help if you eased their minds. What, you mean coax them into following another one of Krell's suicide missions? We lost a lot of men last time. Krell may do things differently, but he is effective in getting them done. He's a recognized war hero. He may have had some victories, but have you seen his casualty numbers? More troopers have been killed under his command than anyone else! That's the price of war, Fives. We're soldiers. We have a duty to follow orders and, if we must, lay down our lives for victory. You believe that, or is that what you were engineered to think? I honor my code. That's what I believe. - Is everyone clear on the plan? Hardcase? - Yes, sir. - Fives, are you clear? - Yeah. All right, get in your groups. Let's move out. Everybody stay alert. Fingers on the trigger. They look spooked. What the Oh, skrag! Blast it! Look out! Its head is ray-shielded! We need rocket launchers! Mayday, mayday! Rex, we need rocket launchers now! Get those rocket launchers down there! Move it, troopers! - Take it, take it. - Thanks, buddy. I got him, I got him. Go! Go, go, go! Keep moving, keep moving! - That was close. - You got a point there. Move it, trooper. Everyone regroup, now! Take cover! Move it! Move it! We're safe for the moment, but they'll be coming around any second. Bring up the launchers, spread detonators along that corridor. Trap them into the bottleneck. We're going to blow those things sky high. Hurry up, we only have a few seconds. Here they come! Hey, come on! Over here! - Let's see how tough you are! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Right over here! Over here! We got her! We got them! Good job! All right, let's move out. That one's still got some juice in it, waste it! Sure. No juice left in him either. Hey! Still hungry? Chew on that! Everyone, keep moving. Hey, Kix, leave it. We've got a problem. Fall back! Fall back now! What are they doing? Captain, continue your attack! Sir, we're overpowered. We need reinforcements! The rest of the battalion is holding the entrance to the gorge, Captain. They're guarding it so your troops can break through to the airbase. - Sir, we can't possibly - You must stand your ground! Do you read me? Captain, are you listening? Do not fall back! That is an order! The platoons are in the formation you requested, General. Should I send them to support Captain Rex? I'll give the order when I give it, Sergeant Appo. Keep the wounded as quiet as possible. All right, you heard the General. Let's go. You can't be serious. I used to think General Krell was reckless, but now I'm beginning to think he just hates clones. The Captain is right. Now let's move out. We can't take them head-on. We need to find another way. You got any ideas? Then this is it. Okay. Let's do it! The rocket launchers don't work on these things! Help me with the wounded! We got to get these guys out of here. Forget it, we have to leave them! We can't just leave them, sir! You don't have a choice. That's an order! You sound like General Krell. Look, Kix, it's more important to save yourself right now. If we survive, you can patch up the wounded later. We're finished. We've still got some fight left in us, Tup, and I've got an idea. What were you thinking? Remember what you were saying about finding another way to destroy those tanks? - Yeah. - Well, I have a mission for you. CT-7567, where are you? General Krell, we've come up with a plan to infiltrate the airbase. What is your plan? I've dispatched two men on a stealth incursion into the airbase. They've been ordered to co-opt starfighters and use them against the tanks. You what? You've put this entire assault on your hope that two clones can do what your entire group could not? Sir, the rocket launchers don't work on these tanks and it'll be easier to slip by undetected while the rest of us keep the tanks occupied. Captain, you will launch a full-forward strike immediately or you will be relieved of duty. We need to hold out as long as we can. I'm trusting Fives and Hardcase to pull this thing off. The second they spot us, I start blasting. Hardcase, can't you take it easy for once? Stick to the plan, instead of guns blazing. I'm sorry, it's just how I am. My commander on Kamino said my growth acceleration chamber had a leak. Made me hyper-active, I guess. Shh! There's the airbase. Hmm Some kind of sensor wall. Use the tree to get over the sensor wall. Uh, how am I supposed to do this, exactly? Figure it out. \"Figure it out, Hardcase. Figure it out.\" What's to figure out about climbing up a tree? How about you try it next time? Great, nice view. I prefer a good fight to all this sneaking around. Wow, I never actually thought that would work. So, how do I start this thing? Well, how should I know? Start pushing buttons! Glad these things are ray-shielded. I don't think I can do this! Watch out! Let's hope this trip was worth it. All right, let's go! Hey, Kix, put it down, you're wasting aim. - Clear out, Captain! - The big guns have arrived, sir! Take that! That's the stuff! Whoo-hoo! Way to go, boys! Attaboy, Hardcase! All right, let's bring them home. Impressive. Sergeant, their defenses are down. Send in the rest of our forces. Attack the airbase! All units, move out. Despite Hardcase's flying, you two saved us all. That wasn't so tough. You sure? You looked a little green when you came out of that fighter. Captain. Report. What is our situation? General, we have taken the base and cut off enemy supply lines to the capital. Luck has smiled on you today, Captain. Consider yourself fortunate. It wasn't all luck, sir. A lot of men died to take this base. The price for such victory. Perhaps someday you'll realize this. Dismissed. He's the one who will never realize.   \n                "}, "Witches of the Mist": {"episode": "s03e14", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tMale announcer: Mysterious deaths. Unknown to the Jedi, a new threat has been unleashed on the galaxy Savage Opress, a pawn in the dangerous game between count Dooku and his former assassin, Ventress. The victims of his brutal massacre on the planet of Devaron are being returned to the Jedi temple for evaluation. It's up to the Jedi council to find this mysterious killer and eradicate him. [Dramatic music] There were no survivors on Devaron. Everyone was killed, including master halsey and his padawan. In the past, only Dooku's assassin was capable of such an effort, but she was presumed dead at the battle of Sullust. Not everything is what it seems. There may be a new threat. Someone or something has eluded Sith Lord. This is not the work of a Sith lord or a Jedi but a reckless, impulsive animal. Ah! Ugh! You have no technique. Sloppy. Ah! But with the proper training, you could be a powerful warrior. You have a natural ability, but we must hone it. Are you up for the challenge of putting your hate to better use? Yes, master. Master Yoda, you called for me? Master Kenobi, show you something we must. We have recovered surveillance footage of the massacre on Devaron. Darth Maul alive? It can't be. I killed him myself. Correct you are, Obi-Wan. A creature of the same species he is, from Dathomir. Dathomir? The planet of the witches? I was under the impression that Darth Maul's home world was Iridonia. Dathomir is the planet where Maul was raised. Iridonia is where the rest of the males of the species dwell. Travel to Dathomir you must. Find the source of this threat you will. You must strengthen your connection with the force, my apprentice. Feel its power within you. [Rumbling] Thud! Now, lift them. [Grunting] Concentrate. [Grumbling] What you ask is impossible. Impossible? The task is only impossible because you have deemed it so. You must connect with your hatred. [Screams] Focus on your power building. Do not think of anyone or anything else. [Screaming] That's it. Your anger is your strength. [Shudders] I hate you. Good. [Groaning] How does one defend against such power? A wise master does not reveal all his secrets at once. In due time, my apprentice. There's the village. Be on guard. These men are ferocious warriors, and they will show no mercy. Don't worry. I won't start anything. Let me handle the negotiations. [Together] Ahh! Yah! So much for not starting something. Hey, don't look at me. Don't harm them. Don't tell me; tell them. [Dramatic music] Back off. We are not here to fight you. We're here for information. A man from your village murdered two Jedi. We need to know where he is. What makes you think he is one of ours? The Jedi council knows he's from this village. We have seen him. Mother Talzin should know of his whereabouts. One of her women took him as a mate. I apologize for the intrusion then. Anakin, kindly release him, please. Stop! Let them go. Who is this mother Talzin? She's the leader of an ancient order of witches, the nightsisters. Great. Warrior-like men, witches this place has all kinds of fun. I'm glad you think so. [Engine whirring] You have completed the first stages of your training, and I am sending you on an assignment to Toydaria. You will bring me king Katuunko, alive. Kill all who might interfere. Yes, my master. It will be done. [Dramatic music] [Engine rumbling] I don't know much of mother Talzin, but I don't expect to be welcome here. [Laughs] You never know. I tend to be popular with the ladies. Too popular. [Ominous music] We've got company. Jedi, come with us. Master Kenobi. Mother Talzin, thank you for your hospitality. I believe you have a question for me. Yes, you're right. We've had reports of a Dathomiri male on the loose. He's already killed two Jedi. Perhaps you know who he is? Master Jedi, we have no control over the males. Our clan has been in exile for years. Don't play innocent with me, mother. Everyone in the galaxy knows females are dominant on this planet. I do not believe anything happens here without your clan knowing about it. To think that the Jedi collect their facts from mere rumors. Rumors. You call two dead Jedi rumors? This thing, this animal, is extremely dangerous. If you have any information about his whereabouts, you must tell us. Savage. Savage Opress. Mother? He is on Toydaria. Thank you. The time has come, sister. You must put your plot against Dooku into effect now. He isn't ready, mother. He needs more training. He has to be ready. Together the two of you will be able to eliminate the count. But you must act now. We cannot keep your new assassin a secret forever. I will have my revenge. You will, sister. You will. [Dramatic music] [Shrieks] Your highness, there is an intruder at the door. Stop him! Boom! I will not be intimidated. Thud! Ugh! At last. [Dramatic music] Ugh! [Choking] Oh! Crack! I guess that's what's left of our ship. We'll borrow one from the Toydarians. [Ominous music] You ignorant beast. I told you I wanted him alive. [Groaning] [Breathing heavily] Forgive me, my master. That is not the way of the dark side. Zap! Ugh! Ventress. That's no way to treat your apprentice. I should know. Savage, you can make amends for your mistake by destroying this witch. [Laughing] I don't think that will be happening, will it, Savage? Remember where your true loyalties lie. With you, mistress. Look. A separatist dreadnought. The king's murderer must have fled there. Dooku sent his assassin to exact his revenge on the Toydarians. We'll make him pay for it. Halt! You are now pri zap! [Screams] Ugh! Finish him now! Ah! [Dramatic music] [Howls] Get up. We must defeat him. Get up. Kill him. Kill him, you fool! Ahh! I can't. He's too powerful. Your weakness will not be my downfall. A failed apprentice makes for a foolish master. Ah! Savage, no! We'll take him together. Right. [Grunting] Leaving so soon, master? You are no match for me. Hmm, that remains to be seen. As you wish. Zap! [Squealing] Time to end this once and for all. Ah! [Steam hissing] [Beeping] Commander, Savage Opress is a traitor. Destroy him. Roger, roger. [Blasters firing] They're not after us. They're attacking that monster. Ahh! You're not supposed to be here. Hey! No sense in hanging around here. My thoughts exactly. [Engine whirring] [Moaning] You have come home to us. I was betrayed by Ventress. The Jedi are after me. I'm not nearly strong enough to defeat them all. Calm yourself. You will be. Who will teach me? You have a brother. A brother? But all of my kin were killed. Not all of them. He lives in the outer rim in exile. You will find him. He will teach you everything you need to learn to become even more powerful. My brother How how will I find him? This talisman has been imbued with the power of our clan. It will be your compass. You have an important destiny to fulfill, Savage Opress you and your brother. Go. You will know where to find him.

Later they discover three beings, more powerful with the force than any jedi have seen before. The father keeps a fragile balance between his daughter, who allies with the light side, and the son, who drifts ever closer to the dark. With his strength failing, the father asks Anakin to stay and take his place, preserving the balance between light and dark, but after passing a perilous test, Skywalker refuses. Now, we find our heroes about to depart for their journey home Or so they think. Anakin. Anakin. Anakin. It's true what they say. You are the chosen one. Join me. Together we can change the balance of the universe, my friend. You must know I will never join the dark side willingly. How simple you make it, light and dark, as if there is one without the other. Aligned, you and I can restore balance wherever we go, peace to the universe. By becoming a sith. Never. We will destroy the sith and the jedi. Were you having a nightmare? Something like that. If you're done napping, I could use a little help here. I'm coming. Leaving so soon? Not without this, you won't. Ahsoka! What's going on? The son took ahsoka. What in the blazes are you talking about? Move. Let me fly. Look out! I didn't think you saw it. It was a giant tower. Of course I saw it. Any sign of him? No. But I think it's obvious where he's taken her. We must hurry. Anakin, this wasn't a mistake. He brought us here for a reason. We must not get involved. Any conflict here could have dramatic repercussions for the universe at large. I don't care. He's too powerful for ahsoka. I won't leave her alone. We are in the middle of something we don't truly understand. We'd be wise to confer with the father first. There's no time. This is what he wants, to divide us. It's my fault he took her. You must feel how strong this part of the planet is with the dark side. The father will know what to do. He can't help us. You cannot keep me here. You hear me? Save your energy. You have been left to die. Then I will escape. Impossible. I have been here for more years than I care to remember. I am a jedi. We don't give up easily. Jedi? Huh. But so young. Where is your master? He will come for me. And if he does not? He will. What makes you so sure? Thank you. The chains? The chains are the easy part. It's what goes on in here that's hard. Don't you see, child? You are alone now. If you are to survive, you must forget your master. I don't think I Ow! What have you done? You are mine now. Anakin. Always on the move. How do I even find the father? You are growing stronger, my son. Am I, father? Vanity, however, is getting the better of you. How so? You have done what is forbidden. You've chosen the dark side and allowed it to feed your anger and desire for power. By bringing the chosen one here, you've shown me my potential. You've only yourself to blame. Do not do this, son. Do not become what you should not. Be strong, I implore you, or else I will be forced to contain you. You look frail, father. I am not dead yet. Well, perhaps I am tired of waiting. I hate you! Father! We will leave him to rest. I must talk to him. Not until he's stronger. But your brother is losing himself to the dark side. He's taken our friend. Then he must have his reasons. The same reason he had for attempting to murder your father? He would never do such a thing. But I saw him. It is not his fault. My nature is to do what is selfless, but my brother's will always be to do what is selfish. Then know you must help us. I cannot interfere with the ways of the force. My father forbids it. Your brother will flee this place and wreak havoc on the universe. You and Anakin combined have the power to stop him. Come with me. I can go no further. When you reach the altar, it will give you what you need. I-I don't understand. He who wields the blade will be able to control my brother. Ahsoka. Ahsoka, it's me. You're safe now. Let's go. Are you proud of me, master? What? Uh, of course, snips. Course I'm proud of you. Now, let's get out of here. He's right, right about everything. You must join him. He only wants what's best for the universe. Hey, what's wrong with you? Always with the criticism, master. Never really believing in me, trusting me. Well, I don't need you anymore. Ahsoka. Ahsoka, listen to me. He has done something to you. Snap out of it. This isn't you, ahsoka. Isn't it? I feel more like myself than I ever have. He asked me to give you a message. He said if you don't join him, he will kill me. I won't let him. Then you will be forced to kill me. Sister. What a pleasant surprise. And you brought a friend. What have you done, brother? Done? I have done what is right Or what is wrong, depending on your point of view. Our father is dying. Did you do it? He is just so selfish and was taking too long to die, so I decided to move things along. Now, why are you here? I won't let you leave this planet. You are not strong enough to keep me here. Not alone, she isn't. Are you referring to your friend, the chosen one? You might want to check up on him. He's a little preoccupied right now. I don't want to fight you, ahsoka. And now the student will kill the master. You're getting ahead of yourself, aren't you, snips? Don'call me that. I hate it when you call me that! Two jedi. Finally, a challenge. Can you feel it, sister? Can you feel the anger, the hate, the fury? Their conflict is feeding you, isn't it? I must stop them. No. If you will stand in my way, then I guess we must fight. Any suggestions? Yes. We cut her free. What is that? It can kill the son. Where did you get that? Give it to me. Ah! You don't have to do this. Then stand aside. I can't. I won't. Stop this! So glad you could make it to our little party, father. You will stop this. You are too weak for me, old man. You mean nothing to me anymore. Anakin, now! Everything has transpired exactly as I planned. You showed them the altar? I am sorry, father. I didn't know how else to stop him. Give it to me, child. Ahsoka, no. Thank you. Your usefulness has come to an end. No! The jedi have brought me the dagger, and you have brought yourself. Now, father, you will die. Father! Why? My daughter. What have I done? Do not hate him, father. It is his nature. No. All is lost. The balance has been broken. I thought by bringing you here, I would But I have destroyed everything. Can you help her? There is no light. The evil has been unleashed, and the dark side shall consume her. You must help her. I cannot undo what is done. There is no hope. Yes, there is. There's always hope. Then let my daughter's last act be to breathe life into your friend. Hey, snips. What's going on? Uh, not much. It's good to see you. As the balance in this world crumbles, so shall war escalate in your galaxy. As my son has descended into the dark side, so have the sith gained strength. We will stop your son. No. You must go now. He needs your ship to leave the planet. You must leave before he can take it. What about you? I shall mourn all that I have done.

After the mysterious death of his friend Tup, ARC trooper Fives embarked on an investigation, which led to the discovery of a hidden chip which is placed inside clone troopers when they are still embryos. The Kaminoan scientist Nala Se claims the chip is harmless and is meant to restrain the clones from violent, unpredictable action. Fives claims otherwise and has convinced Jedi Master Shaak Ti to allow him to plead his case directly to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine on Coruscant. Attention. Please be advised we have arrived at Coruscant and will be touching down at our destination shortly. No Wait Ugh! No. What was that? What did you do? You drugged me. Shh. Greetings, Master Jedi. The Chancellor is waiting inside. Tup The mission AZI-3 Master Shaak Ti, it is good to see you again. I trust you've kept this matter extremely confidential. Of course, Chancellor. Ah, good. So this is the clone who has caused so much alarm? No, no, you drugged me. She There, there, soldier. Don't strain yourself. Sir. Guards, let him down, please. Now, trooper, what brings you before me? - The chips, Chancellor. - Chips? These were removed from both clone troopers. Clone trooper Fives claims they are the cause of the problem. Those are inhibitor chips, which are placed in clones to make them less aggressive and more compliant to orders. I tried to explain to this clone that they are placed in them for his own good, but he removed his chip nonetheless. Our own good? This thing they put in us malfunctioned in clone trooper Tup. I removed his and analyzed it. There were signs of rapid decay. And we're positive this has nothing to do with a virus? No, we still do not know for sure what caused trooper Tup to kill. We only know that his chip failed, and now this clone has removed his own chip, which makes him a risk to himself and others. I'm not at risk. Sir, they're covering something up. I know it. If it's not them, then it's a Separatist plot. They use this chip against us to make us more violent than less. That's why Tup killed General Tiplar! A Separatist plot from before the war even started? That seems unlikely. Don't you agree, Master Shaak Ti? It does, Chancellor. It seems very unlikely. It is absolutely impossible. What we have here is a single malfunction to one clone's inhibitor chip caused by a virus, Separatist plot or not. Perhaps it would be best if clone trooper Fives and I discussed this without your presence. Chancellor, I must object. Please, Master Jedi. Trust me. I will not be alone. I have my security here. I want this soldier to feel he is having a fair say in this matter. Now where were we? No! Let me go! Guards! No! You! He tried to kill me. It was so sudden. You were right, doctor. He must have gone mad without his chip. You have done all you can, Doctor. I trust you will keep these safe? Of course, Chancellor. Fives, stop! Fives! Close the blast doors! I can't believe Fives would try to assassinate the Chancellor. The Kaminoans feel a virus corrupted the clone's inhibitor chip, which has led to this behavior. ARC trooper Fives feels he is the victim of a plot, Separatist or otherwise. All security and clone forces on Coruscant have been ordered to join the manhunt. The Chancellor has been moved to his Senate quarters, and the perimeter has been secured. However, Jedi involvement has not been requested. That's a little odd, isn't it? Hmm. Discover the truth we must. If there is a plot involving the clones, we must get to the bottom of it. We will investigate quietly, undercover. We must make sure this clone is not killed. I'll handle this investigation. Fives was part of the 501st, If Rex and I find him, he'll trust us. Be wary. Since he removed his inhibitor chip, Fives may no longer be the man you once knew. Here you go. Thank you, ladies. Have a good time on Coruscant, now. Thank you! Heya, pal. Where to? Take me to 79's. The clone bar? Oh, you're a clone, huh? Look, just shut up and drive! Okay, you got it. So headin' out for a little fun on the town, eh? I didn't know clones could have fun. There's a lot you don't know about clones. No one knows. Ooh, very mysterious, eh? I like a good mystery. Yeah? You ever hear the one about the people engineered to kill, engineered to kill their best friends, their leaders, and they don't even know it? I'm a cab driver, pal. I hear stories like that all the time. Hey, you payin' for this ride or what? Ah, bill it to the Republic. Bill it to the Republic. Good one, brother! Lousy, cheap clones! It's your credit, pal. You're payin' for this. Ah, your mother's a droid! Get out of here! Droid lover! Come on, brother. Let's go inside. Corporal, that's a nice hat you got there. Mind if I see it? Uh, sure, yeah. Sure, you got it. Hit it! You got it! To the Republic! Can I get you fellas anything? I think it's time for another round. Hey, bartender! Hey, see you around, brother. Kix, Jesse. To the 212th! Down the hatch, boys! Ah! Fan out, and check IDs. So I guess the 501st is back on Coruscant? Oh, yeah, we just got back from Ringo Vinda. The strangest thing happened out there. Yeah, I know. Fives? Whoa. What's going on? They say you tried to assassinate the Chancellor and that you're infected with that virus that killed Tup. I don't have time to explain right now. All I can tell you is is that I'm being framed. All of us, even the Jedi, are in grave danger. But what can I do, Fives? How can I help? I need to talk to Rex, or or General Skywalker. Well, they've been tasked with finding you. Just just turn yourself in! No! No, I'll never get to them. You don't understand. What I'm mixed up in, it goes all the way to the top. The highest levels are involved in the conspiracy. I have to talk to General Skywalker and Rex directly, alone. Look, I can contact Rex, but I can't guarantee he'll bring the General. Good, good, good. Thanks, Kix. I appreciate it. Here. Here are the coordinates. Just make sure he meets me there. Right. Good luck, Fives. Identification, please. Have you seen this clone? Uh, no, sir. I haven't seen him. All right. Move along. Identification, please. All right, you guys check out. Move along. Sir, the fugitive clone has been spotted by one of our probes in sector I-9. Well, these are the coordinates Kix gave us. Let's hope Fives is inside. Eh, I hope he knows what he's doing. Fives? Fives, we're here. Come on out. We just want to talk to you. General Skywalker, thank you. Thank you for trusting me. Now, have you come without troops? We have. Put down your weapons, then. I don't think so, Fives. Please, sir! Please, I'm unarmed. All right. I'm putting my pistols down. What are we here for, Fives? I need your help. I know you do. We know you're not well. It's been rough for you these past couple days. I'm not crazy! Please, please, just just hear what I have to say. We're here to help you, Fives. Just come with us. Let us take you back to the Temple. No! I just need you to listen to me. Please. I'm not really sure we have any other choice. I was framed because I know the truth the truth about a plot, a massive deception. By whom? Well, there's a sinister plot in the works against the Jedi. I have proof of it. I can prove that everything that I know is true beyond a shadow of a doubt! Show me the evidence. The evidence is in here. It's it's in here. It's in all of us, every clone. What is it? Organic chips built into our genetic code to make us do whatever someone wants, even kill the Jedi. It's all in here. Let's just get you some help first. Then we can review everything. It'll be okay, Fives. We'll sort this out. Ah, you don't believe me! We're closing in on the target. Everyone be ready. Fives, we are listening to you. We only want to help. How do I know you're not tricking me? How do I know it won't be a trap? The Chancellor will try to kill me. I promise you that! The Chancellor? He's in on it! I don't know to what extent. But I know he orchestrated much of this. He told me in the medical bay! He told you? When you tried to assassinate him? You have gone too far, Fives. The Chancellor isn't capable of what you claim. He is! I swear to you, General. You have no idea Stand down, soldier! Stand down! Get on your knees! No! No! No! Stay back! Don't do it! Don't do it, soldier! Get away from me! Fives, no! Fives! Fives! Fives Get this ray shield off! Fives. Brother Call for help! We need a medic! Rex Fives This it's bigger than any of us than anything I could have imagined. I-I never meant to I only wanted to do my duty. Brother Fives. Stay with me, Fives! Fives! The mission the nightmares they're finally over. Fives? No, Fives. Come on, Fives, don't go! Stay with me. Stay with me. Fives! Fives! Don't go. No. Oh, no. A tragic situation, indeed. About the clones' breakdowns, have we discovered any new evidence? I've had my own personal doctors examine both bodies. It appears Nala Se did miss something in her examination. Another cause your doctors found? A parasite. Native to Ringo Vinda. Probably in the canteen of water they both shared. It did cause the inhibitors to decay, once the parasite had taken hold. It is very rare. However, just to be cautious, we have prepared an inoculation for every clone trooper in our army. So I guess it's over, then? Yes. We can finally put this whole wretched situation behind us. We must direct our attention back to the war at hand. Each day we grow closer and closer to victory. Lord Tyranus, have you received the inhibitor chip that you requested? I have, indeed. You have done well, doctor. Our plan has gone undiscovered, master. The clone in question is now dead, and the Jedi still suspect nothing. Good. Destroy all evidence. When the time comes, no one will be able to stop our plan to execute Order 66.   \n                "}, "Shades of Reason": {"episode": "s05e15", "transcript": "\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \t\t\tVillainy swells! With an army of the galaxy's most vicious criminals, Darth Maul and Savage Opress conspire with Pre Vizsla and the Death Watch to topple Duchess Satine, ruler of Mandalore. While the conspirators prepare to attack the Mandalorian capital of Sundari from a base on Zanbar, the fate of 2,000 other neutral systems is under threat as Darth Maul moves closer to establishing a vast criminal empire. Where are my targets? We've identified them at these locations. However, as I've said before, if we try to take Mandalore by force, our people will turn against us. I will use my army of crime lords to attack different targets across Sundari and sow chaos to undermine the Duchess' rule. Our gangsters will make her look too weak to maintain control. Then you and your Death Watch will capture and arrest us, bringing order where Satine's weak government could not. We'll be saviors. Exactly. A good plan. Indeed. I'll prepare the troops. It's a risk to trust those monsters. How do we know they'll keep their end of the bargain? We need those Sith and their thugs to cause some pain and show the Mandalorian people how weak Satine really is. After this is done, no one will doubt why we're in power. Most will welcome us. Then what? Then we execute Maul and those thugs. Those criminals will scatter, and Mandalore will be ours. I believe Vizsla will betray us. We have no other choice. We cannot rule openly without drawing the attention of the Jedi. We need Vizsla as the face of our rule for now. The promise of wealth will find us a new face on Mandalore. You have learned well, my apprentice. Greed never fails to motivate. What's the matter? I am scanning life forms. I believe this spice shipment is infested. Step back. Ah! Gangsters! We're under attack. Surrender. My Master is taking over these docks. You are now under the control of the Pyke Syndicate. Duchess, the shipping docks are under attack. By whom? The Death Watch? No, it appears to be a crime syndicate. Our guards are helpless against their numbers, and the people are demanding we do something to stop them. Welcome to Mandalore. Stand down. You are now all slaves of the Black Sun Clan. Fall back! It's the gangsters. Lock the vaults. Open the bank. We're here for a withdrawal. Guards, now. The Black Sun is attacking the vaults. Send reinforcements. Take him. I need you all to remain calm. These attackers are just thugs brought on by the lowest element. The Duchess Satine has led us to ruin. Death Watch. Guards, stay back. Vizsla, you must be the one responsible for these attacks. No, I'm not responsible. But I can offer a solution. People of Mandalore I am Pre Vizsla of clan Vizsla. Death Watch is here to save you from these intergalactic gangsters that threaten our great city. This is a war, and we will win. Join me and let us defend Mandalore against the criminals. We need action, not pacifism. Do not listen to him! His war will cause the end of Mandalore as we know it. We are under attack. There is no time for discussion. The name Mandalore should send fear into the hearts of these gangsters. It's war! It's war! Vizsla! Vizsla! War! The people are beginning to follow you. It is time for Death Watch to take action. Make sure you put on a good show. As you wish, Lord Maul. What should we do? There's nothing we can do. The Duchess' forces are being overrun across the entire planet. Listen. It sounds like there is fighting going on out there. Ah! What's going on? We're Death Watch, and we're here to rescue you. You have my thanks, soldier. No, thank Pre Vizsla. You're safe now. It's the Death Watch. The Death Watch are our saviors. - They saved us. - They freed us. Our saviors. The Death Watch saved us. Stop them! They've robbed the main vault. Keep up, you weaklings. Ugh. This monster will not trouble the people of Mandalore any longer. Take him away, Captain. Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Duchess, Pre Vizsla and his men have entered the palace. Should we stop them? How can we? The people are on their side now. Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! No! There will be no bloodshed. But, Duchess-- - I will not be provoked to violence by these terrorists. Listen, Duchess. Do you hear the people? They cry out for change. Your weak-minded rule of Mandalore is at an end. The resurrection of our warrior past is about to begin. Duchess Satine and the New Mandalorian leaders have fled in cowardice while the Death Watch brought these criminals to justice. Your new Prime Minister, Pre Vizsla, leader of Death Watch, exiled governor of Concordia, true son of Mandalore, presents you with the lords of the most feared crime families in the galaxy. Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! You cannot hold me here. I am the Duchess of Mandalore. Your actions will bring our civilization to ruin. Is that you, Satine? Almec? Here for a visit, or has peace betrayed you too, Duchess? Peace exists only in the minds of the faithful. And faith has been the greatest disappointment. Only when it is broken. What you did for the people as Prime Minister betrayed their trust. And you betrayed mine. Destitution leaves little room for faith. My actions allowed the people hope in your leadership. The supplies I bought on the black market kept you in power. Another error of judgment. The people made willing sacrifices for their freedom. Corruption is not the answer. Then enjoy your freedom, Duchess. You'll have plenty of time to tell me all about it. The transition of power will be seamless. We now have the support of the people and Satine to bait Kenobi. With his demise, our deal will be complete. Your oversight requires correction. We now have a base, an army, and the means to expand to other neutral systems. It wasn't an oversight. It was intentional. I don't have an interest in the other systems. Your vision no longer matters. Oh, don't fret. I'll still honor our deal. Kenobi will be dealt with. But now you'll do as I say. The violence is over! The last of the parasites infecting Mandalore has been caught. The Duchess has abandoned her duty to protect Mandalore. Her political dream only encourages aggression against our planet. We have learned from this beast the consequences of pacifist principles. It's now time to restore the traditions of Mandalore. No one will ever threaten us again! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla has captured the support of his people, just as we planned. However, he is not their anointed leader yet. There is still time for us to put in place a leader under our control. Then let us escape, and we shall find one. Patience. We must move cautiously. By placing us in prison, Vizsla has unwittingly put us in reach of several candidates for his successor. Who do you mean, brother? Vizsla has imprisoned the Duchess here. Other political advisors of hers will be within these walls who will suit our purposes well. Hey, quiet, you two. Apprentice, I wish a tour of this facility. Ah! You are the now the former Duchess Satine, are you not? What do you want, you monster? Mm, nothing yet, but I will have a use for you in time. Where are the other leaders of your people? You should know already. They've either sided with Vizsla or have been killed. There's no one left now but Almec and I, but he's as corrupt and vile as you. Really? Hmm. Thank you for being so cooperative. Almec? Yes? I can deliver you from this prison. What was your position in this government? I am the former Prime Minister. Satine imprisoned me on charges of corruption and conspiracy for using the black market. He's a murderer. He caused the death of children. Quiet. What do you want from me? Mandalore is in need of a Prime Minister. I thought you were in league with Pre Vizsla. We were. Clearly you are powerful, but how can two of you overthrow Vizsla and his supporters? Vizsla is a soldier, and like every soldier, he is bound by honor. I will challenge him to single combat in front of his men. He will not deny me. Hmm. If you defeat him, according to the ancient laws of Mandalore, his soldiers will be honor-bound to follow you. Precisely. Sir, they're attacking. I challenge you, one warrior to another. And only the strongest shall rule Mandalore. So be it. Give him his weapon. For Mandalore! Ah! Ah! Oh. Like you said, only the strongest shall rule. I claim this sword and my rightful place as leader of Death Watch. Never. No outsider will ever rule Mandalore. Hmm. If you will not join me, you will all die. You're all traitors. Unfortunately for you, history will not see it that way. Execute them! Silence, please, silence. Hear me now. Duchess Satine, the so-called pacifist, who could not protect you when your lives were at stake, has murdered Pre Vizsla, the true hero of Mandalore. Satine is now under arrest, and it was Pre Vizsla's last command that I be reinstated as Prime Minister. I know my past is checkered, but I promise you, I take full responsibility for my people. And my heart now bleeds for your pain. However, from this point on, Mandalore will be strong, and we will be known as the warriors we were always meant to be. You have done well, Prime Minister. I shall waste no time in building my administration. Choose wisely. I will hold you personally responsible for their failures. Yes, Master. Is there anything more you require? Go. Rule my people.   \n                "}}}}}
