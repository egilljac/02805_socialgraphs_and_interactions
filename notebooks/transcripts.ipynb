Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. This separatist movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to the Galactic Senate to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC To assist the overwhelmed Jedi\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\n[The text fades away, and a planet, Coruscant, the capital of the Galaxy, comes into view, as does a shining starship and two smaller guard ships.]\\n\\n[Aboard Senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ship]\\n\\nLieutenant: Senator, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making our final approach into Coruscant.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Cord\\xc3\\xa9): Very good, Lieutenant.\\n\\n[They make their way through a layer of fog, and then land safely on a landing platform amongst the flying traffic and tall skyscrapers. The pilots of the guard ships get out, and one (Captain Typho) takes his helmet off. The \\xe2\\x80\\x98Senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gets off the larger spacecraft.]\\n\\n[On Landing Platform]\\n\\nTypho: We made it. I guess I was wrong. There was no danger at all.\\n\\n[Just as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gets off her ship, it explodes. Debris flies everywhere. Typho and the other guard rush forward. The other guard takes off her helmet, and is revealed to be the real Senator. The other was a decoy for protection. Sen. Padm\\xc3\\xa9 Amidala rushes to her decoy.]\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: Cord\\xc3\\xa9!\\n\\nCord\\xc3\\xa9: *faintly* My lady\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 So sorry\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve failed you Senator\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: *whimpering* No\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\n[Cord\\xc3\\xa9 rolls onto her side, dead. Typho approaches.]\\n\\nTypho: My lady, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still in danger here.\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have come back.\\n\\nTypho: This vote is very important. You do your duty; Cord\\xc3\\xa9 did hers, now come.\\n\\n[Typho takes a step, Padm\\xc3\\xa9 doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t follow.]\\n\\nTypho: Senator Amidala, Please.\\n\\n[Both Leave]\\n\\n[A Large Dome-Shaped Building: The Chancellor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Palace. Inside a meeting room are six members of the Jedi Order and Chancellor Palpatine.]\\n\\nChancellor Palpatine: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.\\n\\nMace Windu: If they do break away-\\n\\nPalpatine: I will not let this republic that has stood for a thousand years be split in two. My negotiations will not fail.\\n\\nWindu: If they do, you must realize that there aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Keepers of the Peace, not soldiers.\\n\\nPalpatine: Master Yoda- do you think it will really come to war?\\n\\nYoda: *thinks* The Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is.\\n\\n[A Hologram Message pops up on the Chancellor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Desk. An Alien is projected.]\\n\\nHologram Alien: (speaking Huttese) The Loyalist Committee has arrived, your Honor.\\n\\nPalpatine: Good. Send them in.\\n\\n[Hologram flickers out]\\n\\nPalpatine: We will discuss this matter later.\\n\\n[Door opens, the Loyalists (including Padm\\xc3\\xa9) enter, while the Jedi exit.]\\n\\nYoda (to Padm\\xc3\\xa9): Senator Amidala\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Your tragedy on the landing platform\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 terrible. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: Do you have any idea who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behind this attack?\\n\\nWindu: Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo.\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: I think Count Dooku is behind it.\\n\\nKi Adi-Mundi: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a political idealist, not a murderer.\\n\\nWindu: You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t assassinate anyone: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not in his character.\\n\\nYoda: But, for certain Senator, in grave danger you are.\\n\\nPalpatine: Master Jedi\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 may I suggest the senator be placed under the protection of your graces.\\n\\nBail Organa: Do you really think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wise decision under these stressful times?\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: Chancellor, if I may comment I do not believe-\\n\\nPalpatine: \\xe2\\x80\\xa6the situation is that serious. No, but I do, Senator. I realize all too well that additional security may be disruptive for you. But, perhaps, someone you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re familiar with. An old friend, like\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Master Kenobi.\\n\\nWindu: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.\\n\\nPalpatine: Do it for me, milady, please. The thought of losing you\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 is unbearable.\\n\\nWindu: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady.\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: Thank you, Master Windu.\\n\\n[A smooth, tall building: Padm\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s temporary home. An elevator is running up the side, containing two people.]\\n\\n[Anakin straightens out his robes, looking nervous.]\\n\\nObi Wan: You seem a little on edge.\\n\\nAnakin: Not at all.\\n\\nObi Wan: I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t felt you this tense since\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 since we fell into that nest of gundarks.\\n\\nAnakin: *scoffs* You fell into that nightmare, Master, and I rescued you. Remember?\\n\\nObi Wan: Oh\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 yes. *Chuckles* You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.\\n\\nAnakin: I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen her in ten years, master.\\n\\n[The elevator stops, and they get off. They are approached by Jar-Jar Binks]\\n\\nJar Jar: Obi? Obi! Mesa so smilin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to seein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 yousa.\\n\\nObi Wan: Good to see you again, Jar-Jar.\\n\\nJar Jar: Senator Padm\\xc3\\xa9! Mesa palos here. Lookie, lookie, Senator. Desa Jedi arriven.\\n\\n[Padm\\xc3\\xa9 walks over, and Obi-Wan bows.]\\n\\nObi Wan: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great pleasure to see you again milady.\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: It has been far too long Master Kenobi. *To Anakin* Ani? My goodness, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve grown.\\n\\nAnakin: So have you. Grown more beautiful, I mean. Well, for- for a senator, I mean.\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: Ani, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.\\n\\n[All walk over to sit at two couches and a low table.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you.\\n\\nTypho: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Captain Typho of Her Majesty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s security service. Queen Jamilla has been informed of your assignment. I am grateful you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit to.\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need more security, I need answers. I want to know who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trying to kill me.\\n\\nObi Wan: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation.\\n\\nAnakin: We will find out who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trying to kill you, Padm\\xc3\\xa9. I promise you.\\n\\nObi Wan: We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.\\n\\nAnakin: I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.\\n\\nObi Wan: We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin, and you will pay attention to my lead.\\n\\nAnakin: Why?\\n\\nObi Wan: What?\\n\\nAnakin: Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overkill, Master; investigation is applies in our mandate.\\n\\nObi Wan: We will do exactly as the Council has instructed\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and you will learn your place, young one.\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: Perhaps with merely your presence, the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll excuse me, I will retire.\\n\\n[All stand as she walks off.]\\n\\nTypho: I know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll feel better with you here. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have an officer stationed at every floor, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be in the control center downstairs.\\n\\nJar Jar: Mesa bustin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with happiness seein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 yousa again, Ani.\\n\\nAnakin: She hardly even recognized me, Jar-Jar. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve thought about her every day since we parted. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forgotten me completely.\\n\\nJar Jar: Shesa happy. Happier than mesa seein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 her in a longo time.\\n\\nObi Wan: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focusing on the negative, Anakin, be mindful of your thoughts. She was pleased to see us. Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s check the security.\\n\\n[Anakin follows Obi-Wan in one direction, Jar-Jar goes in another.]\\n\\n[A walkway-type structure on Coruscant around a large, round building. Night has fallen. A green and yellow speeder is parked on the walkway, and someone gets out: Zam Wessel- a hired assassin. Zam meets a strange figure- a bounty hunter clad in blue and gray armor.]\\n\\nZam: I hit the ship but they used a decoy. Bounty Hunter: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam. My client is getting impatient. Here- take these.\\n\\n[The Bounty Hunter holds out a tube containing two wormlike beasts.]\\n\\nBounty Hunter: Be careful- they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very poisonous. Zam- there can be no mistakes this time.\\n\\n[Zam walks off]\\n\\n[Back in Padm\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s temporary home, Anakin and Obi Wan talk.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin would try that way. Any activity up here?\\n\\nAnakin: Quiet as a tomb. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like just waiting here for something to happen to her.\\n\\nObi Wan: What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on?\\n\\nAnakin: She covered the cameras. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think she liked me watching her.\\n\\nObi Wan: What is she thinking?\\n\\nAnakin: She programmed Artoo to warn us if there is an intruder.\\n\\nObi Wan: There are many other ways to kill a senator.\\n\\nAnakin: I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we, Master?\\n\\nObi Wan: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using her as bait.\\n\\nAnakin: It was her idea. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry: no harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.\\n\\nObi Wan: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too risky. Besides, your senses aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that attuned my young apprentice.\\n\\nAnakin: And yours are?\\n\\nObi Wan: Possibly.\\n\\n[Back to Zam and the Walkway.]\\n\\n[Zam loads the worm tube into a droid, which flies off.]\\n\\n[Back, again, to Anakin and Obi-Wan.]\\n\\nObi Wan: You look tired.\\n\\nAnakin: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep well anymore.\\n\\nObi Wan: Because of your mother?\\n\\nAnakin: *nods* I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why I keep dreaming about her.\\n\\nObi Wan: Dreams pass, in time.\\n\\nAnakin: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d much rather dream about Padm\\xc3\\xa9. Just being around her is\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 intoxicating.\\n\\nObi Wan: Your thoughts betray you, Anakin. You have made a commitment to the Jedi Order, a commitment not easily broken. And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a politician, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not to be trusted.\\n\\n[In Padm\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, the next one over. She is asleep in bed, Artoo is there on guard, and the droid is at the window.]\\n\\nAnakin: She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like the other senators, Master.\\n\\nObi Wan: It is my experience that senators focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy in order to get those funds.\\n\\nAnakin: Not another lecture\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 at least not on the economics of politics.\\n\\n[The droid flies closer to the window, and cuts a circular hole in the glass with a laser. It opens the tube, releasing the large, poisonous worms, which scuttle around, keeping out of Artoo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sight and creeping closer to Padm\\xc3\\xa9.]\\n\\nAnakin: And besides, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re generalizing. The Chancellor doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appear to be corrupt.\\n\\nObi Wan: Palpatine is a politician. I have observed that he is very clever in following the passions and the prejudices of senators.\\n\\n[Back to Anakin and Obi-Wan.]\\n\\nAnakin: I think he is a good man. But-\\n\\nObi Wan: I sense it, too!\\n\\n[Both rush into Padm\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room. Anakin jumps up onto her bed, ignites his lightsaber, and chops the creatures in half. Padm\\xc3\\xa9 awakens, and Obi-Wan sees the droid back away from the window. He jumps through the window, smashing the glass, and grab hold of the droid. Dorm\\xc3\\xa9, Padm\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Handmaiden, rushes in.]\\n\\nAnakin: *frantic* Stay here!\\n\\nDorm\\xc3\\xa9: Are you all right, milady?\\n\\n[The droid is flying through the city at high speeds, Obi-Wan dangling by his fingertips. The droid smashes Obi-Wan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand into a building in an attempt to make him fall.]\\n\\n[A sort of garage.]\\n\\n[Anakin rushes around, looks for a speeder, and then hops into one and flies off.]\\n\\n[Back to Obi-Wan.]\\n\\n[The droid flies directly through a line of traffic: attempting again to shake Obi-Wan off.]\\n\\nAlien in Speeder: What the-?\\n\\nDug in Speeder: Argh! Jedi poo-doo!\\n\\n[Over to Zam- still on the balcony.]\\n\\n[She sees the droid approaching with Obi-Wan on it. Seeing this as a bad sign, she shoots with a rifle, then gets in her speeder and flies off.]\\n\\n[Back to Obi-Wan.]\\n\\n[The droid is hit by Zam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shot, and it explodes. Obi-Wan is forced to let go and stats to fall. The ground is hundreds of feet off- maybe thousands. Luckily, Anakin saves him in his speeder. He crawls into the front seat, and Anakin continues to chase Zam the Assassin through Coruscant.]\\n\\nObi Wan: What took you so long?\\n\\nAnakin: Oh\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 ah\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 you know, Master. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find a speeder that I really liked.\\n\\nObi Wan: There he is. Anakin: With the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\nObi Wan: If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you did your wit you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.\\n\\nAnakin: I thought I already did\\n\\nObi Wan: Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.\\n\\n[They take a very violent, steep, and sharp turn down. Anakin keeps going straight down.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Pull up Anakin. Pull up!\\n\\n[He pulls up only when they almost collide with the foundations of a skyscraper.]\\n\\nAnakin: Whoa-oa!\\n\\nObi Wan: You know I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it when you do that!\\n\\nAnakin: Sorry, Master. I forgot you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like flying.\\n\\nObi Wan: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind flying, but what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing is suicide!\\n\\n[They follow Zam into a trench-sort of area between two buildings. Zam reaches her pistol out the window and shoots a power coupling. Just before it starts to shoot out violet beams of electricity, she passes by. Unfortunately, Anakin and Obi-Wan get zapped.]\\n\\nAnakin: Ow- ow- ow- ow- ow\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\nObi Wan: Anakin! How many times have I told you to stay- away- from- power- couplings\\xe2\\x80\\xa6! *pauses* *sarcastic* That was good!\\n\\n[They fly out of the trench. Zam goes through a tunnel, dodging other speeders and vehicles. Anakin flies out in that general direction, and then takes a right.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Where are you going? He went that way!\\n\\nAnakin: Master, if we keep this chase going any longer that creep is gonna end up deep-fried. Personally, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to know who he is and who he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working for. This is a shortcut\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I think.\\n\\n[Anakin flies a bit longer and then stops.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Well, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lost him.\\n\\nAnakin: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m deeply sorry master.\\n\\nObi Wan: That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. Once again you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve proved-\\n\\nAnakin: If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll excuse me\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\n[Anakin jumps out, falling down until he lands on top of Zam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speeder.]\\n\\nObi Wan: I hate it when he does that.\\n\\n[Anakin is just barely holding on, and Zam tries to get him off by shooting, suddenly turning down, and pulling up. She turns her head at one point, and a patch of her skin turns greenish and then goes back to normal. Eventually Anakin gets himself on top of the cockpit. He ignites his lightsaber and stabs down at the assassin, but jets go of the handle while avoiding blasts from her pistol. It falls away to be caught by Obi-Wan, who is still following close behind. More blasts from Zam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pistol set fire to the control panel. She frantically tries to put out the flames and land her ship at the same time. In her frenzy, Anakin falls off, but luckily she was near the ground. A few seconds later, she crash-lands and runs into a club. Anakin follows her, and meets up with Obi-Wan at the entrance.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Anakin!\\n\\nAnakin: She went into the club, Master!\\n\\nObi Wan: Patience. Use the Force. Think.\\n\\nAnakin: Sorry, Master.\\n\\nObi Wan: He went in there to hide, not to run.\\n\\nAnakin: Yes, Master.\\n\\n[Obi Wan holds out Anakin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightsaber.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Next time, try not to lose it.\\n\\nAnakin: I try, Master.\\n\\nObi Wan: Why do I get the feeling you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be the death of me?\\n\\nAnakin: Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that, Master. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the closest thing I have to a father.\\n\\nObi Wan: Then why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you listen to me?\\n\\nAnakin: I am trying.\\n\\n[Both walk into the club. Obi-Wan surveys the crowd, looking for Zam.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Do you see him?\\n\\nAnakin: I think that he is a she. And I think that she is a Changeling.\\n\\nObi Wan: In that case be extra careful. Go and find her.\\n\\nAnakin: Where are you going, Master?\\n\\nObi Wan: For a drink.\\n\\n[Both walk off in different directions. Anakin goes wandering in search of Zam, Obi-Wan goes directly to the bar. The bartender hands him a drink. A mean sitting next to him with two antennae holds out something similar to a cigarette.]\\n\\nObi Wan: *to bartender* Thank you.\\n\\nStranger: You want to buy some death sticks?\\n\\n[Obi-Wan waves his hand with every sentence he says, using a mind trick on the stranger.]\\n\\nObi Wan: You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to sell me death sticks.\\n\\nStranger: Oh\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 uh\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to sell you death sticks.\\n\\nObi Wan: You want to go home and rethink your life.\\n\\nStranger: I want to go home and\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 rethink my life\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\n[The Stranger walks off to rethink his life. Obi-Wan takes a sip of his drink. Meanwhile, Anakin isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t having much luck with finding Zam, but he can sense she is close. She happens to be walking towards Obi-Wan, laser pistol in hand. Obi-Wan senses her presence as well. Anakin walks toward the bar, following Zam. When Zam reaches Obi-Wan, she raises her pistol to the back of his head and is about to shoot, when he suddenly ignites his lightsaber, wheels around, and takes off her arm. The crowd hushes instantly. Anakin arrives at the scene.]\\n\\nAnakin: *to Zam* Easy\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 *To Crowd* Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.\\n\\n[The three walk outdoors, Obi-Wan supporting Zam. They set her down on the sidewalk and begin to interrogate her.]\\n\\nObi Wan: Do you know who it was that you were tring to kill?\\n\\nZam: *weakly* Mmph\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It was a senator from Naboo.\\n\\nObi Wan: And who hired you?\\n\\nZam: It was just a job.\\n\\nAnakin: *pleadingly* Who hired you? Tell us. *pause* *forcefully* Tell us now!\\n\\nZam: *whimpers * It was a bounty hunter called-\\n\\n[A dart flies out of the air and hits her in the neck. Obi-Wan looks up and sees a person hovering on a jetpack a ways above them, clad in blue and gray armor. He flies away a second later. Her skin begins to shift color and form to a rough green and an inhuman texture and shape. Zam says something in a strange language, and her head falls back. She is dead. Obi-Wan picks up the dart and inspects it.]\\n\\nObi Wan: A toxic dart\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\n[The next day, in the Jedi Temple. The High Council is seated, but Obi-Wan and Anakin remain standing.]\\n\\nYoda: Track down this bounty hunter, you must, Obi-Wan.\\n\\nWindu: Most importantly, find out who he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working for.\\n\\nObi Wan: What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting.\\n\\nYoda: Handle that, your Padawan will.\\n\\nWindu: Anakin- escort the Senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be safer there. And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use registered transport. Travel as refugees.\\n\\nAnakin: As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.\\n\\nYoda: Until caught, this killer is, our judgment she must respect.\\n\\nWindu: Anakin- go to the senate and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.\\n\\n[A little later that day- in the Chancellor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meeting room again. Anakin and Palpatine are discussing Senator Amidala.]\\n\\nPalpatine: I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that.\\n\\nAnakin: Thank you, Your Excellency.\\n\\nPalpatine: And so... they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve finally given you an assignment! Your patience has paid off.\\n\\nAnakin: Your guidance rather my patience.\\n\\nPalpatine: You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible. I have said it many times: you are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.\\n\\nAnakin: Thank you, Your Excellency.\\n\\nPalpatine: I see you becoming the greatest of all Jedi\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 even more powerful than Master Yoda.\\n\\n[In the Jedi Temple. Windu, Obi-Wan, and Yoda are walking along.]\\n\\nObi Wan: I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment.\\n\\nYoda: The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.\\n\\nWindu: The boy has exceptional skills.\\n\\nObi Wan: But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.\\n\\nYoda: Yes, yes. A flaw more and more common among\\n\\nJedi. Hmm\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Too sure of themselves, they are: even the older, more experienced ones.\\n\\nWindu: Remember, Obi-Wan: if the prophecy is true, your apprentice is the only one who can bring the force back into balance.\\n\\n[Later on: In Padm\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s temporary home.]\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking an extended leave of absence. It will your responsibility to take my place in the senate. Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.\\n\\nJar Jar: Mesa honored to be taking on disa heavy burden. Mesa accept dis wit moy moy humility and euh\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\nPadm\\xc3\\xa9: Jar Jar- I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wish to hold you up.

Please do not resist.\\n\\nYAVIN 4: Rebel Base\\n\\nPA: LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.\\n(Inside the temple)\\nDRAVEN:You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re currently calling yourself Liana Hallik. Is that correct? Possession of unsanctioned weapons, forgery of Imperial documents, aggravated assault,escape from custody, resisting arrest. Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out who you really were. Jyn Erso? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your given name, is it not? Jyn Erso? Daughter of Galen Erso. A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development.\\nJYN ERSO: What is this?\\nMON MOTHMA: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a chance for you to make a fresh start.\\nCASSIAN: We think you might be able to help us.\\nMON MOTHMA: This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence.\\nCASSIAN: When was the last time you were in contact with your father?\\nJYN ERSO: 15 years ago.\\nCASSIAN: Any idea where he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been all that time?\\nJYN ERSO: I like to think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dead, makes things easier.\\nCASSIAN: Easier than what? That he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being a tool of the Imperial war machine?\\nJYN ERSO: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had the luxury of political opinions.\\nCASSIAN: Really? When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera?\\nJYN ERSO: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a long time.\\nCASSIAN: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d remember you, though, wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he? He might agree to meet you, if you came as a friend.\\nDRAVEN:We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up against the clock here, girl, So if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing to talk about, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just put you back where we found you.\\nJYN ERSO: I was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve no idea where he is. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen him in years.\\nCASSIAN:We know how to find him, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not our problem. What we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed.\\nJYN ERSO: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all rebels, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\nMON MOTHMA: Yes, but Saw Gerrera\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an extremist. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust.\\nJYN ERSO: What does this have to do with my father?\\nCASSIAN: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an Imperial defector in Jedha. A pilot. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being held by Saw Gerrera. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets. The pilot says he was sent by your father.\\nMON MOTHMA: We need to stop this weapon before it is finished.\\nDRAVEN: Captain Andor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mission is to authenticate the pilot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story and then, if possible, find your father.\\nMON MOTHMA: It appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon. Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw,we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony.\\nJYN ERSO: And if I do it?\\nMON MOTHMA: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make sure you go free.\\n\\n(Outside the temple)\\nDRAVEN: Captain Andor!\\n(Inside a U-Wing)\\nK2-SO: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m K-2SO. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a reprogrammed Imperial droid.\\nJYN ERSO: I remember you.\\nK2-SO: I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha.\\nJYN ERSO: Apparently so.\\nK2-SO: That is a bad idea. I think so, and so does Cassian. What do I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis.\\n(Outside the ship)\\nDRAVEN: Galen Erso is vital to the Empire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weapon program. Forget what you heard in there, there will be no extraction. You find him, you kill him.Then and there.\\n(Inside the U-Wing)\\nCASSIAN:You met Kay-Tu?\\nJYN ERSO: Charming.\\nCASSIAN:He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a by-product of the reprogram.\\nK2-SO: Why does she get a blaster, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t?\\nCASSIAN: What.\\nJYN ERSO: I know how to use it.\\nCASSIAN: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid of. Give it to me.\\nJYN ERSO: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to Jedha. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a war zone.\\nCASSIAN: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the point. Where did you get it?\\nJYN ERSO: I found it.\\nK2-SO: I find that answer vague and unconvincing.\\nJYN: Trust goes both ways.\\nCassian hops into the pilot seat\\nK2-SO: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high.\\nCASSIAN: Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get going.\\nK2-SO: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very high.\\n\\n(Partisan base on Jedha)\\nSAW GERRERA: Lies!Deceptions!Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see it. Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot. Local boy, huh?\\nBODHI: Uh-huh.\\nTWO TUBES: (This was found in his boot when he was captured)\\nBODHI: Okay, I can hear you.He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t capture me,I came here myself.I defected, I defected.\\nSAW GERRERA: Every day, more lies.\\nBODHI: Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie? No, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have time for this! I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too late.\\nThe sack is pulled off of Bodhi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head.\\nBODHI: Okay... So, you... Um. Uh.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for you. And I gave it to them, they did not find it! I gave it to them. Galen Erso. He told me to find you.\\nSAW GERRERA: Bor Gullet.\\nBODHI: Bor Gullet? Galen Erso sent me! He told me to find you!\\n\\n(On the bridge of a Star Destroyer overlooking the construction of the Death Star.)\\nTARKIN: Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha, Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays, and now this. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project, countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.\\nKRENNIC: When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin, the Senate will be of little concern.\\nTARKIN: When has become now, Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay, you have made time an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience.\\nKRENNIC:I will not fail.\\nTarkin watches the superlaser be set into place, completing the Death Star.\\n\\nInside Jyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream, she sees herself as a little girl.\\nGALEN:What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the matter, Jyn? You looked frightened.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll always protect you. Stardust. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ever change.\\nLYRA: Trust...\\nLYRA: Galen.\\n\\nJyn wakes up\\nCASSIAN:We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming into orbit.You have controls.\\nThe U-Wing lands in front of a view of the Holy City of Jedha with a Star Destroyer hovering over. Multiple smaller shuttles are going back and forth between the destroyer and the city.\\nCASSIAN: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jedha.Or what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left of it. We find Saw, we find your father.\\nJYN:What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with the Destroyer?\\nCASSIAN:It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been attacking the cargo shipments.\\nJYN:What are they bringing in?\\nCASSIAN: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98what are they taking out?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Kyber crystal. All they can get. We wondered why they were stripping the temple, now we know.It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the fuel for the weapon.\\nK2-SO: The weapon your father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s building.\\nJYN ERSO: Maybe we should leave target practice behind.\\nK2-SO: Are you talking about me?\\nCASSIAN:She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right.We need to blend in. Stay with the ship.\\nK2-SO: I can blend in. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an Imperial droid. This city is under Imperial occupation\\nJYN ERSO: Half the people here want to reprogram you. The other half want to put a hole in your head.\\nK2-SO: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m surprised you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so concerned with my safety.\\nJYN ERSO: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just worried they might miss you and hit me.\\nK2-SO: Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sound so bad to me.\\n\\n(In the Partisan base.)\\nBodhi is strapped to a chair. A strange bloblike alien with long tentacles emerges from the darkness.\\nSAW GERRERA: Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts, No lie is safe.What have you really brought me, cargo pilot? Bor Gullet will know the truth.The unfortunate side effect, is that one tends to lose one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind.\\nBor Gullet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tentacles begin to wrap around Bodhi and stroke his head, reaching into his thoughts.\\nBODHI: No.\\n\\n(In the Holy City of Jedha)\\nCassian and Jyn walk through a crowd. Jyn bumps into Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba\\nDR. EVAZAN: Hey, you just watch yourself.\\nCASSIAN: No, no.Tourist, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any trouble, sorry. Come on. Come on.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Citizens of Jedha, you must come forward with information of the location of this missing cargo pilot. A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded.\\nCASSIAN: I had a contact, one of Saw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rebels, but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just gone missing.His sister will be looking for him. The temple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been destroyed but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be there waiting. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw.\\nJYN: Hope?\\nCASSIAN: Yeah. Rebellions are built on hope.\\nSTORMTROOPER: (To a citizen of Jedha City) Hands where I can see them. Get over there. Show me some identification. Check inside.\\nJYN: Is this all because of your pilot?\\nShe notices Chirrut Imwe sitting beside the street.\\nCHIRRUT: May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you.\\nCASSIAN: Wait for me.\\nCassian leaves.\\nCHIRRUT: May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you.\\nCHIRRUT: (To Jyn) Would you trade that necklace for a glimpse into your future? Yes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m speaking to you. I am Chirrut \\xc3\\x8emwe.\\nJYN ERSO: How did you know I was wearing a necklace?\\nCHIRRUT: For that answer you must pay. What do you know of kyber crystals?\\nJYN ERSO: My father, he said they powered the Jedi lightsabers.\\nCassian returns.\\nCASSIAN: Jyn. Come on, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go.\\nCHIRRUT: The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.\\nCASSIAN: Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not here to make friends.\\nJYN ERSO: Who are they?\\nCASSIAN: The Guardians of the Whills. Protectors of the Kyber Temple. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing left to protect, so now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just causing trouble for everybody.\\nJYN ERSO: You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.\\nCASSIAN: We have to hurry. This town, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ready to blow.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Citizens of the Empire, Imperial forces...\\nThe stormtrooper tank explodes and Partisans begin fighting the stormtroopers.\\nJYN: Tell me you have a backup plan.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Incoming.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Put your guns down.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Behind us.\\nJYN: Looks like we found Saw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rebels.\\nJyn sees a small child standing in the danger, crying. She runs to save her.\\nCASSIAN: Jyn, no!\\nthe child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother quickly arrives and takes her daughter.\\nMOTHER: Thank you.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Hit the tower.\\nCITIZEN: Get out of there!\\nCITIZEN: Quickly, the kyber, get it. Here, take the kyber. Take the kyber. Come on!\\nCASSIAN: This way!\\nThey are surprised by an imperial droid that looks exactly like K2-SO. Jyn shoots it and it falls to the ground. K2-SO walks out from behind it.\\nK2-SO: Did you know that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t me?\\nJYN ERSO: Of course!\\nCASSIAN:I thought I told you to stay on the ship.\\nK2-SO: You did, but I thought it was boring, and you were in trouble. There are a lot of explosions for two people blending in.\\nA grenade sails towards K2-SO and he catches it without looking and throws it backwards towards a group of stormtroopers.\\nSTORMTROOPER:Freeze right there...\\nThe grenade explodes, killing the stormtroopers.\\nK2-SO: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right, I should just wait on the ship.\\nCassian, Jyn and K2-SO walk into a clearing with multiple stormtroopers.\\nSTORMTROOPER:Halt! Stop right there!\\nSTORMTROOPER:Where are you taking these prisoners?\\nK2-SO: These are prisoners.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Yes. Where are you taking them?\\nK2-SO: I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison.\\nCASSIAN: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking us to...\\nK2-SO slaps Cassian.\\nK2-SO: Quiet! And there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fresh one if you mouth off again!\\nSTORMTROOPER: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take them from here.\\nK2-SO: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. If you could just point me in the right direction, I can take them, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken them this far\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nCASSIAN: Hey, wait a second.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Take them away.\\nK2-SO: Wait!\\nSTORMTROOPER: Hey, droid.You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take them away! You stay here. We need to check your diagnostics.\\nK2-SO: Diagnostics? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m capable of running my own diagnostics, thank you very much.\\nChirrut emerges from a doorway.\\nCHIRRUT: Let them pass in peace! Let them pass in peace. The Force is with me, and I am with the Force. And I fear nothing, for all is as the Force wills it.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Hey! Stop right there!\\nSTORMTROOPER: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blind.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Is he deaf?\\nSTORMTROOPER: I said: Stop right there!\\nChirrut stops. Listening closely to the stormtroopers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 movements. At the right moment, he springs into action, easily beating up the stormtroopers.\\nCHIRRUT: Is your foot all right?\\nChirrut knocks down the last stormtrooper, but many more surround him. Suddenly, rapid blaster fire kills all the stormtroopers. The blaster fire has come from Chirrut\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend, Baze Malbus.\\nCHIRRUT: You almost shot me.\\nBAZE: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re welcome.\\nCassian, Jyn and K2-SO emerge from a hiding spot.\\nK2-SO: Clear of hostiles!\\nBaze aims his blaster at K2-SO\\nK2-SO: One hostile!\\nJYN: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with us!\\nCHIRRUT:They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all right.\\nJYN:Thanks.\\nK2-SO: Cassian, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry about the slap.\\nCASSIAN: Go back to the ship. Wait for my call.\\nCASSIAN: Is he a Jedi?\\nBAZE: There are no Jedi here anymore. Only dreamers like this fool.\\nCHIRRUT: The Force did protect me.\\nBAZE: I protected you.\\nJYN: Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?\\nCHIRRUT: Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you see we are no friends of the Empire?\\nThe Partisans suddenly surround the group\\nTWO TUBES: (Tell that to the one who killed our men.)\\nJYN ERSO: Anyone who kills me or my friends will answer to Saw Gerrera.\\nTWO TUBES: (And why Is that?)\\nJYN ERSO: Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso.\\nTWO TUBES: (Take them!)\\nSacks are put over everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heads.\\nCHIRRUT: Are you kidding me? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m blind!\\n\\n(Inside the prison cells in the Partisan base.)\\nCHIRRUT: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one with the Force and the Force is with me.\\nBAZE: You pray?\\nCHIRRUT: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one with the Force and the Force is with me.\\nBAZE: Really?\\nCHIRRUT: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one with the Force and the Force is with me.\\nBAZE: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s praying for the door to open. CHIRRUT: It bothers him, because he knows it is possible. Baze Malbus was once the most devoted Guardian of us all.\\nCASSIAN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m beginning to think the Force and I have different priorities.\\nBAZE: Relax, Captain. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in worse cages than this one.\\nCASSIAN: This is a first for me.\\nCHIRRUT: There is more than one sort of prison, Captain, I sense that you carry yours wherever you go.\\n\\n(Outside of the prison cells)\\nSAW GERRERA: Jyn. Is it really you? I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it.\\nJYN ERSO: Must be quite a surprise.\\nSAW GERRERA: Are we not still friends?\\nJYN ERSO: The last time I saw you, you gave me a knife and loaded blaster and told me to wait in a bunker until daylight.\\nSAW GERRERA: I knew you were safe.\\nJYN ERSO: You left me behind.\\nSAW GERRERA: You were already the best soldier in my cadre.\\nJYN ERSO: I was sixteen.\\nSAW GERRERA: I was protecting you!\\nJYN ERSO: You dumped me!\\nSAW GERRERA: You were the daughter of an Imperial science officer! People were starting to figure that out. People who wanted to- to use you as a hostage. Not a day goes by that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of you. But today, of all days? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a trap, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\nJYN ERSO: What?\\nSAW GERRERA: The pilot! The message. All of it. Did they... send you? Did you come here to kill me? There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not much of me left.\\nJYN ERSO: The Alliance wants my father.They think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sent you a message about a weapon. I guess they think by sending me you might actually help them out.\\nSAW GERRERA: So what is it that you want, Jyn?\\nJYN: They wanted an introduction, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m out now. The rest of you can do what you want.\\nSAW GERRERA: You care not about the cause?\\nJYN: The cause? Seriously? The Alliance? The...The rebels? Whatever it is you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re calling yourself these days?All it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever brought me is pain.\\nSAW GERRERA: You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?\\nJYN: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a problem if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look up.\\nSAW GERRERA: I have something to show you, come.\\n\\n(On the Death Star)\\nTARKIN: The Emperor is awaiting my report.\\nKRENNIC: One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion.\\nTARKIN: And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.\\nKRENNIC:Your concern is hardly warranted.\\nTARKIN: If saying it would only make it so.\\nKRENNIC:All Imperial forces, have been evacuated, and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.\\nTARKIN: That won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be necessary. We need a statement, not a manifesto. The Holy City will be enough for the day. KRENNIC: Target Jedha City, prepare single reactor ignition.\\nPTERRO: Sir, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in position, ready to...\\nKRENNIC: Fire!\\nPTERRO: Commence primary ignition.\\n\\n(In the Partisan prison)CHIRRUT: Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one in the next cell?\\nCASSIAN: What? Where?\\nBaze looks through the hole in the wall and sees Bodhi\\nBAZE: An Imperial pilot.\\nCASSIAN: Pilot?\\nBAZE: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to kill him!\\nCASSIAN: No, no, No, wait!\\nBAZE: Come here!\\nCASSIAN: NO!\\nBAZE: Back off. Back off.\\nCASSIAN: Okay.\\nCASSIAN: Are you the pilot? Hey, hey are you the pilot? The shuttle pilot? Pilot?\\nCHIRRUT: What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong with him?\\nCASSIAN:Galen Erso. You know that name?\\nBODHI: I brought the message, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the pilot. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the pilot. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the pilot.\\nCASSIAN: Okay, good. Now where is Galen Erso?\\n\\n(On the Death Star)\\nGUNNER: Standby.\\n\\n(In the Partisan base)\\nSAW GERRERA: This is the message I was sent.\\nThe holoprojector lights up and a hologram of Galen Erso appears.\\nGALEN ERSO: Saw, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re watching this, then perhaps there is a chance to save the Alliance. Perhaps there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a chance to explain myself and, though I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dare hope for too much, a chance for Jyn, if she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alive, if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve missed her. Jyn, my Stardust, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t imagine what you think of me. When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths. I was told that, soon enough, Krennic would have you as well. As time went by, I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work, if I took my own life, it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable, and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never find it. But, Jyn. Jyn, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re listening My beloved, so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m strong, because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw, the reactor module, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the key. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the place I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve laid my trap. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well hidden and unstable, one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station.\\nThe Death Star blasts the Holy City of Jedha, vaporizing it in an instant.\\nGALEN ERSO: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need the plans, the structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor. I know there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station...\\nThe hologram cuts off because of the earthquake going through the Partisan base due to the Death Star\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fire.\\nCASSIAN: Go. Go.\\nCASSIAN:(Over the comms)K-2? K-2, where are you?\\nK2-SO: There you are. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m standing by as you requested. Although there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon.\\nCASSIAN: Locate our position. Bring that ship in here now!\\nCHIRRUT:Where are you going?\\nCASSIAN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to find Jyn. Get the pilot. We need him.\\nBAZE: All right. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get the pilot.\\nBAZE: Pilot.\\nHe aims his blaster at Bodhi\\nBODHI: No, no, no.\\nHe fires but the blaster hits the cell door, freeing Bodhi.\\nBAZE: Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go.\\nCASSIAN: Jyn! We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go. I know where your father is.\\nSAW GERRERA: Go with him, Jyn. You must go.\\nJYN ERSO: Come with us.\\nSAW GERRERA: I will run no longer.\\nCASSIAN: Come on.\\nJYN ERSO: But you must save yourself.\\nCASSIAN: Come on.\\nSAW GERRERA: Go! There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no time! Save the Rebellion! Save the dream!\\n\\n(On the Death Star)\\nKRENNIC: Oh. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautiful.\\n\\n(Outside the Partisan base)\\nBAZE: Chirrut, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go! CASSIAN: [to Bodhi]Come on! Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get out of here!\\nThey all pile into the U-Wing\\nCASSIAN: Get us out of here! Punch it!\\nK2-SO: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not very optimistic about our odds.\\nCASSIAN: Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not, K. Come on! Punch it.\\nK2-SO:I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t completed my calculation.\\nCASSIAN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make them for you.\\nThe U-Wing shifts into hyperspace and zips away from Jedha.\\n\\n(On the Death Star)\\nTARKIN:I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations.\\nKRENNIC: And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell the Emperor as much?\\nTARKIN: I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.\\nKRENNIC: That was only an inkling of it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s destructive potential. TARKIN:I will tell him, that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of years ago effective immediately.\\nKRENNIC: We stand here amid my achievement not yours!\\nTARKIN:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.\\nKRENNIC: The breaches have been filled, Jedha has been silenced.\\nTARKIN:You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s facility.\\nKRENNIC: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see about this.\\n\\n(In the Rebel base on Yavin 4)\\nREBEL: A coded message from Captain Andor, sir. Weapon confirmed. Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise.\\nGENERAL DRAVEN: Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance.\\n\\n(In hyperspace, in the U-Wing.)\\nCHIRRUT: Baze, tell me. All of it? The whole city?Tell me.\\nBODHI: All of it.\\nCASSIAN: Understood. Set a course for Eadu.\\nK2-SO: Setting course for Eadu.\\nJYN: Is that where my father is?\\nCASSIAN: I think so.\\nBODHI: So you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Galen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter.\\nJYN: You know him?\\nBODHI: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Bodhi, the pilot.\\nJYN: You brought the message.\\nBODHI: Yes, your father... He said I could get right by myself.He said I could make it right, if I was brave enough and listened to what was in my heart. Do something about it. Guess it was too late.\\nJYN: It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too late.\\nBODHI: Seems pretty late to me.\\nJYN: No. We can beat the people who did this. My father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it.They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a way to defeat it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wrong about my father.\\nCASSIAN: He did build it.\\nJYN: Because he knew they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do it without him. My father made a choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rigged a trap inside it.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why he sent you. To bring that message.\\nCASSIAN: Where is it? Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the message?\\nJYN: It was a hologram.\\nCASSIAN: You have that message, right?\\nJYN: Everything happened so fast.\\nCASSIAN: Did you see it?\\nJYN: You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe me.\\nCASSIAN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not the one you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to convince.\\nCHIRRUT: I believe her.\\nCASSIAN: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good to know.\\nBAZE:What kind of trap? You said your father made a trap.\\nJYN: The reactor. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s placed a weakness there. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been hiding it for years. He said if you can blow the reactor- the module- the whole system goes down. You need to send word to the Alliance.\\nCASSIAN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done that.\\nJYN: They have to know there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a way to destroy this thing. They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.\\nCASSIAN: I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t risk sending that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the heart of Imperial territory.\\nJYN:Then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find him. And bring him back, and he can tell them himself.\\n\\n(On the Death Star)\\nPTERRO: Course set for Eadu, sir.\\n\\nEADU: Imperial Research Facility\\n\\nThe U-Wing flies carefully through the rainy, dark canyons of Eadu.\\nCHIRRUT: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one with the Force and the Force is with me.\\nK2-SO: 20 degrees to the right. 10 degrees up.\\nBODHI: No, no, no, lower. Lower!\\nK2-SO: Are you sure this is the way?\\nBODHI: They have landing trackers. They have patrol squadrons. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to stay in the canyon, keep it low.\\nCASSIAN: Watch your right!\\nK2-SO: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a 26% chance of failure.\\nCASSIAN: How much farther?\\nBODHI: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure, I never really come this way, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re close, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re close. I know that.\\nK2-SO: Well, now there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a 35% chance of failure.\\nBODHI: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to know, thank you.\\nK2-SO: I understand.\\nBODHI: Now! Put it down now!\\nK2-SO: The wind...\\nBODHI: If you keep going, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be right over the shuttle depot. Watch out!\\nThe U-wwwWing hits its engine on a rock and the ship begins to fall.\\nK2-SO: Hey!\\nCASSIAN: Hold on tight! We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming down hard!\\n\\n(On Yavin 4)\\nDRAVEN: Try them again.\\nREBEL: I am, sir. We... The signal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone dead.\\nDRAVEN: Squadron up, target Eadu.\\n\\n(On Eadu)\\nBODHI: How about now, check stabilizers?\\nCASSIAN: Bodhi, where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the lab?\\nBODHI: The research facility?\\nCASSIAN: Yeah. Where is it?\\nBODHI: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just over the ridge.\\nCASSIAN: And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a shuttle depot straight ahead of us? You are sure of that?\\nBODHI: Yes.We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to hope there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still an Imperial ship left to steal. \\nCASSIAN: Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. Hopefully, the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here.Bodhi, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming with me. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go up the ridge and check it out.\\nJYN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m coming with you.\\nCASSIAN: No, your father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t risk it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the messenger.\\nJYN: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ridiculous. We all got the message.Everyone here knows it. K2-SO:One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how you said it. The whole system goes down.\\nCASSIAN: Get to work fixing our comms! All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up against.So, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go very small and very carefully up the rise and see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get out of here.\\nCHIRRUT: Does he look like a killer?\\nBAZE: No. He has the face of a friend.\\nJYN: Who are you talking about?\\nCHIRRUT: Captain Andor.\\nJYN: Why do you ask that? What do you mean, does he look like a killer?\\nCHIRRUT: The Force moves darkly near a creature that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about to kill.\\nK2-SO: His weapon was in the sniper configuration.\\n\\n(On a rocky ridge.)\\nBODHI: No, no, no... We got to go up. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see much from down there. This way.\\nCASSIAN:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be right behind you. Come on.\\n\\n(In the crashed U-Wing.)\\nBAZE: Where are you going?\\nCHIRRUT: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to follow Jyn. Her path is clear.\\nBAZE: Alone? Good luck!\\nCHIRRUT: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need luck, I have you!\\nK2-SO: What are they doing? If Cassian comes back, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving without them.\\n\\n(On a ridge overlooking the Imperial Research Facility.)\\nCASSIAN: You see Erso out there?\\nBAZE:We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come too far.\\nCHIRRUT:Patience, my friend.\\nBODHI: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s him. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s him, Galen, in the dark suit.\\nCASSIAN:Get back down there, and find us a ride out of here.\\nBODHI: What are you doing?\\nCASSIAN: You heard me.\\nBODHI: You said we came up here just to have a look.\\nCASSIAN:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking. Go. Hurry!\\n\\n(On the landing platform in front of the research facility.)\\nKrennic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ship is landed and he walks out, flanked by deathtroopers, towards a group KRENNIC: Excellent news, Galen. The battle station is complete. You must be very proud.\\nGALEN ERSO: Proud as I can be, Krennic.\\nKRENNIC: Gather your engineers, I have an announcement. Is that all of them?\\nGALEN ERSO: Yes.\\nKRENNIC: Gentlemen.One of you betrayed the Empire. One of you has conspired with a pilot to send messages to the Rebellion. And I urge that traitor step forward.\\nKRENNIC: Very well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll consider it a group effort, then. Ready!\\nENGINEER: No.\\nENGINEER: No, please.\\nKRENNIC: Aim... and...\\nENGINEER: No, no.\\nKRENNIC: fire!\\nGALEN ERSO:Stop! Stop! Krennic, stop. It was me. It was me. They have nothing to do with it. Spare them.\\nKRENNIC: Fire!\\nKRENNIC: How do I know the weapon is complete?\\nGALEN ERSO: Let me share with you some details.\\n\\nK2-SO: Cassian. Cassian, can you hear me?\\nCASSIAN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here.You got it working.\\nK2-SO:Affirmative yes, although we have a problem! There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an Alliance squadron approaching.\\nREBEL PILOT: Clear the area!\\nCASSIAN: No. No, no, no!Tell them to hold up!Jyn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on that platform!\\n\\nKRENNIC: Jedha. Saw Gerrera.His band of fanatics. Their Holy City. The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone.\\nGALEN: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never win.\\nKRENNIC:Now where have I heard that before?\\n\\nK2-SO:Relay from Captain Andor.\\nREBEL: General.\\nK2-SO: Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support. Alliance forces onsite.Please confirm.\\nDRAVEN: Get the squadron leader on, Get him on now!\\nREBEL:They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already engaged, sir.\\n\\nCASSIAN: Dead. No.\\nKRENNIC: Return fire! To your stations. Get our fighters in the air now!\\nJYN:Father!\\n\\nSTORMTROOPER: Go, go, go, go.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Fall back! Fall back!\\nPTERRO: Director, we need to evacuate.\\nJYN: Papa. Papa, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jyn.\\nGALEN ERSO: Jyn.Stardust.\\nJYN: Papa.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen your message. The hologram, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it.\\nGALEN ERSO: It must be destroyed.\\nJYN: I know. I know. We will.\\nGALEN ERSO: Jyn.Look at you.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve so much to tell you.\\nJYN: Papa.No. No. Papa!Papa! Come on.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Over there, take them down.\\nCASSIAN: Come on. Jyn, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go. Come on.\\nJYN: I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave him,\\nCASSIAN: Listen to me. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing you can do. Come on.\\nJYN: I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave him.\\nCASSIAN: Come on! Help me. Move!\\nCASSIAN: Down!\\nCASSIAN:Come on. Come on.\\nK2-SO: Well done.You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a Rebel now.\\nCASSIAN: Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go. Come on, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move! Come on, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get out of here. Move, move, move. Okay, K-2, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go.\\nK-2SO: Copy that.\\n\\nCASSIAN: Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm.\\nK2-SO: Understood.\\nJYN: You lied to me.\\nCASSIAN: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in shock.\\nJYN: You went up there to kill my father.\\nCASSIAN: You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about.\\nJYN: Deny it.\\nCASSIAN: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in shock, and looking for someplace to put it.\\nJYN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it before.\\nCASSIAN: I bet you have.\\nJYN: They know.You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone.\\nCASSIAN: I had every chance to pull the trigger. But did I? Did I?\\nJYN: You might as well have. My father was living proof and you put him at risk. Those were Alliance bombs that killed him!\\nCASSIAN: I had orders! Orders that I disobeyed! But you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand that.\\nJYN: Orders?When you know they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wrong? You might as well be a stormtrooper.\\nCASSIAN: What do you know? We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all have the luxury of deciding when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you? Some of us live it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in this fight since I was 6 years old. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it.\\nJYN: You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk your way around this.\\nCASSIAN: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to. Yavin Four! Make sure they know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming in with a stolen ship.\\nAnybody else?\\n\\nVANEE: My lord, Director Krennic has arrived.\\nDARTH VADER: Director Krennic.\\nKRENNIC: Lord Vader.\\nDARTH VADER:You seem unsettled.\\nKRENNIC:No. Just pressed for time. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a great many things to attend to.\\nDARTH VADER:My apologies. You do have a great many things to explain.\\nKRENNIC:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 potential.\\nDARTH VADER:Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked.\\nKRENNIC:It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test.\\nDARTH VADER:You were not summoned here to grovel, Director Krennic.\\nKRENNIC: No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s...\\nDARTH VADER: There is no Death Star. The Senate has been informed that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.\\nKRENNIC:Yes, my lord.\\nDARTH VADER:I expect you to not rest until you can assure the Emperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way.\\nKRENNIC:So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still in command? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll speak to the Emperor about\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nDARTH VADER:Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director.\\n\\nPAMLO: We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender.\\nORGANA: Are we really talking about disbanding something that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked so hard to create?\\nRADDUS: We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just give in.\\nVASPAR: We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact!\\nORGANA: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only now managed to gather our forces.\\nJEBEL: Gather our forces? General Draven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already blown up an Imperial base!\\nDRAVEN: A decision needed to be made.\\nPAMLO: If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s war you want, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fight alone!\\nVASPAR: If that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going, why have an Alliance at all?\\nRADDUS: If she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s telling the truth, we need to act now!\\nMON MOTHMA: Councilors, please!\\nMERRICK: It is simple, the Empire has the means of mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.\\nJEBEL: A Death Star, this is nonsense.\\nJYN ERSO: What reason would my father have to lie? What benefit would it bring him?\\nDRAVEN:To lure our forces into a final battle. To destroy us once and for all. VASPAR:To risk everything, based on what? The testimony of a criminal? The dying words of her father, an Imperial scientist?\\nJEBEL: Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget the Imperial pilot.\\nJYN ERSO: My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this.\\nDODONNA: So you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve told us.\\nPAMLO: If the Empire has this kind of power, what chance do we have?\\nJYN: What chance do we have? The question is \\xe2\\x80\\x98What choice?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. The time to fight is now!\\nREBEL: Yes.\\nJYN: Every moment you waste is another step closer to the ashes of Jedha.\\nREBEL: What is she proposing?\\nREBEL: Just let the girl speak!\\nJYN ERSO: Send your best troops to Scarif.Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to. We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it.\\nPAMLO: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope?\\nJYN ERSO: Rebellions are built on hope.\\nVASPAR: There is no hope.\\nRADDUS: I say we fight.\\nJEBEL: I say the Rebellion is finished.\\nMON MOTHMA: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry, Jyn. Without the full support of the council, the odds are too great.\\n\\nPA: General Syndulla, please report to the briefing room.\\nBAZE:You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look happy.\\nJYN: They prefer to surrender.\\nBAZE: And you?\\nCHIRRUT: She wants to fight.\\nBODHI: So do I. We all do.\\nCHIRRUT: The Force is strong.\\nJYN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure four of us is quite enough.\\nBAZE: How many do we need?\\nJYN: What are you talking about?\\nCASSIAN:They were never going to believe you.\\nJYN: I appreciate the support.\\nCASSIAN: But I do. I believe you.We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to volunteer. Some of us... ... most of us, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spies. Saboteurs. Assassins. Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion. And every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in. A cause that was worth it. Without that, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lost.Everything we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done would have been for nothing. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t face myself if I gave up now. None of us could. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be comfortable.\\nBODHI: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a bit cramped, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll all fit.We could go.\\nCASSIAN: Okay. Gear up. Grab anything that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nailed down. Go, go, go!\\nK2-SO: Jyn. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be there for you. Cassian said I had to.\\nJYN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not used to people sticking around when things go bad.\\nCASSIAN: Welcome home.\\n\\nPA: Bravo team to the Intelligence office for extraction mission report.\\nJYN: May the Force be with us.\\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: Cargo shuttle, read back, please. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on out there? That ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s off limits. No one is suppose to be on board until farther instructions.\\nBODHI: Yes, yes we are. Affirmative.\\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an impounded Imperial ship. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your call sign, pilot?\\nBODHI: Um.\\nJYN ERSO: We have to go.\\nBODHI:It-It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s um...\\nJYN: Say something. Come on.\\nBODHI: Rogue... Rogue One.\\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: Rogue One? There is no Rogue One.\\nK2-SO: Well, there is now.\\nBODHI: Rogue One, pulling away.\\nK2-SO: Pulling away.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: Despite what the others say, war is inevitable.\\nSENATOR ORGANA: Yes, I agree. I must return to Alderaan to inform my people that there will be no peace. We will need every advantage.\\nMON MOTHMA: Your friend, the Jedi.\\nSENATOR ORGANA: He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purge. Yes, I will send for him.\\nMON MOTHMA: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need someone you can trust.\\nSENATOR ORGANA: I would trust her with my life. Captain Antilles, I have a mission for you.\\nCAPTAIN ANTILLES: Senator.\\n\\nBODHI: Okay, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming in. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a planetwide defensive shield with a single main entry gate. This shuttle should be equipped with an access code that allows us through.\\nK2-SO: Assuming, the Empire hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t logged it as overdue.\\nBODHI: Or stolen. JYN:And if they have?\\nBODHI:Then,they shut the gate and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all annihilated in the cold, dark vacuum of space.\\nK2-SO: Not me, I can survive in space.\\nBODHI: Okay. Here it goes. Cargo shuttle SW-0608 requesting a landing pad.\\nSHIELD GATE OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not listed on the arrival schedule.\\nBODHI: Acknowledged, Gate Control. We were rerouted from Eadu Flight Station. Transmitting clearance code now.\\nK2-SO: Transmitting.\\nSHIELD GATE OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608? You are cleared for entry.\\nBODHI:- Yes!\\nK2-SO: Impressive.\\nJYN: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell the others.\\nBODHI: Okay.\\n\\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9. Acknowledge, please.\\nBODHI: SW-0608 proceeding to LP9 as instructed.\\nCASSIAN: The main building down there, what is it?\\nBODHI:That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Citadel Tower. They keep all the Imperial structure archives in there. If the plans are anywhere, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be there.\\nCASSIAN: The dish at the top? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it for?\\nBODHI: I guess it takes a lot of signals to send those data files out.\\nK2-SO: Landing track engaged\\nBODHI: Landing track locked.\\nCASSIAN: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re landing. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming in!\\nJYN: Saw Gerrera used to say,1 fighter with a sharp stick and nothing left to lose can take the day. They have no idea we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming. They have no reason to expect us. If we can make it to the ground, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take the next chance. And the next.On and on until we win... or the chances are spent. The Death Star plans are down there.Cassian,K2, and I will find them. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find a way to find them. \\nCASSIAN: Melshi, Pao, Baze, Chirrut, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take main squad, move east and get wide of the ship. Find a position between here and the tower.Once you get to the best spot, light the place up. Make ten men feel like a hundred.\\nBAZE: All right.\\nCASSIAN: And get those troopers away from us.\\nBODHI: What should I do?\\nCASSIAN: Keep the engine running. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re our only way out of here.\\n\\nSTORMTROOPER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, be prepared to receive inspection team.\\nJYN: Ready?\\nOFFICER: Hello.\\nBODHI: Hey, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably looking for a manifest.\\nOFFICER: That would be helpful.\\nBODHI: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just down here.\\n\\nPILOT: Director Krennic, we are entering the Scarif shield gate. General Ramda has been informed of your arrival.\\n\\nBAZE: Good luck, little sister.\\nBODHI: Go! Go now, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re clear!\\nMELSHI: All right, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go. Come on. Move, move, move.\\nK2-SO: I have a bad feeling about\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nCASSIAN: Kay!\\nJYN ERSO: Quiet.\\nK2-SO: What?\\n\\nCASSIAN: We need a map.\\nK2-SO: Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one just lying about.\\nCASSIAN: You know what you have to do.\\n\\nMELSHI: One per pad. Pick your spot. We want to draw them out. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call the timing. Go!\\nSTORMTROOPER: Hey, did you hear the rumors?\\nSTORMTROOPER:Yeah, the T-15s have been marked obsolete.\\nSTORMTROOPER:Oh boy, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about time for that.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Hey.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Watch out.\\nSTORMTROOPER: What the...?\\n\\nRAMDA: Director, what brings you to Scarif?\\nKRENNIC: Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission he has ever sent called up for inspection.\\nRAMDA: All of them?\\nKRENNIC: Yes. All of them. Get started.\\n\\nCASSIAN: Kay?\\nK2-SO: Our optimal route to the data vault places only 89 stormtroopers in our path. We will make it no more than 33% of the way before we are killed.\\nCASSIAN: Melshi, talk to me.\\nMELSHI: Ready, ready. Standing by.\\nCASSIAN: Light it up.\\n\\nKRENNIC: Are we blind?Deploy the garrison! Move!\\n\\nTONC: Troopers! Troopers. Troopers on the left!\\n\\nROMODI: Sir? Scarif base, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reporting a rebel incursion.\\nTARKIN: I want to speak to Director Krennic.\\nROMODI: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s there, sir. On Scarif.\\nTARKIN: The original plans for this station are kept there, are they not?\\nROMODI: They are.\\nTARKIN: Prepare for the jump to hyperspace and inform Lord Vader.\\n\\nOFFICER: Can I help you?\\nK2-SO: That won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be necessary.\\n\\nREBEL: Senator! Senator.\\nMERRICK: Stop right there, Private.\\nMON MOTHMA: Let him speak.\\nREBEL: Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am. Rebels on Scarif.

Retreat!\\n\\nRADDUS: This is Admiral Raddus of the Rebel Alliance. All Squadron leaders report in.\\nMERRICK: Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.\\nGOLD LEADER: This is Gold Leader, standing by.\\nRED LEADER: This is Red Leader, standing by.\\n\\nIMPERIAL CREW MEMBER: Sir, those are rebel ships.\\nIMPERIAL LIEUTENANT: Get Admiral Gorin, immediately.\\n\\nADEMA: Director, the rebel fleet, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amassing outside the shield.\\nKRENNIC: Lock down the base. Lock down.\\nADEMA: And close the shield?\\nKRENNIC: Do it!\\n\\nRADDUS: Red and Gold squadron, attack formations. Defend the fleet.

We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trapped?\\nK2-SO: We could transmit the plans to the rebel fleet. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to get a signal out to tell them it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming.It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the size of the data files. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the problem.They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never get through.Someone has to take that shield gate down.\\nCASSIAN: Bodhi.Bodhi, can you hear me?Bodhi, tell me you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out there. Bodhi!\\nBODHI: Hello, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re standing by. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started fighting, the base is on lockdown!\\nCASSIAN: I know, listen to me!The rebel fleet is up there.You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to tell them to blow a hole in the shield gate so we can transmit the plans.\\nBODHI: Wait, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not hooked into the comm tower. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not tied in.\\nCASSIAN: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting them out of here. Find a way! Cover our backs.\\nJYN ERSO: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need this. You wanted one, right?\\nK2-SO: Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected.\\nCASSIAN: Jyn. Come on.\\n\\nAT-ACT PILOT: Fire on my command.\\nBAZE: Look!\\n\\nBODHI: Get ready. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to go out there.\\nREBEL:What\\xe2\\x80\\x99re you doing?\\nBODHI:They closed the shield gate, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stuck here. But, the rebel fleet is pulling in.We just have to get a signal strong enough to get through to them and let them know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trapped down here. For that, we have to connect to the communications tower. Now, I can patch us in over here, the landing pad but you have to get on the radio, get one of the guys out there to find a master switch. Get them to activate the connection between us and that comm tower. REBEL: Okay.\\nBODHI: Then go!\\n\\nRADDUS:What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on down there, Lieutenant?\\nLIEUTENANT: Unknown, sir. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t raise them. All rebel frequencies are blocked.\\nRADDUS: Keep trying.

I can locate the tape, but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need the handles for extraction.\\nCASSIAN: What are we supposed to do with these? Whoa.\\nK2-SO: Well, finally.\\nSTORMTROOPER: Wait, stop.\\nK2-SO:The rebels! They went over there.\\nCASSIAN: Kay. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on out there?\\nK2-SO: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one. Oh well.\\nRED PILOT:Come on!\\nVANDER: Red Leader, this is Gold Leader, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting our attack run on the shield gate.

Bodhi will send a signal from here. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patching us in.But you guys have to open up a line for the tower.\\nMELSHI: How? Please advise.\\nTONC: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a master switch to the base of the Comm tower.\\nMELSHI: Master switch, describe, what are we looking for?\\nTONC: What does it look like? The master switch? Where is it?\\n\\nMERRICK: Two wings, reinforce those troops on the beach. All fighters, on me. We have to shield them from air attack.\\nBLUE ELEVEN: Troop reinforcements.\\nREBEL MARINE: Here we go. For Jedha!\\nMARINE: Jedha!\\n\\nRED PILOT: We have no effect on that shield.

Rebel spaceships, \\n                   striking from a hidden base, have won their first \\n                   victory against the evil Galactic Empire.\\n                   During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal \\n                   secret plans to the Empire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ultimate weapon, the \\n                   Death Star, an armored space station with enough \\n                   power to destroy an entire planet.\\n                   Pursued by the Empire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sinister agents, Princess \\n                   Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of \\n                   the stolen plans that can save her people and \\n                   restore freedom to the galaxy\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n              The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total \\n              eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny \\n              silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \\n              from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \\n              by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly \\n              laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing \\n              the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\\n              INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\\n              An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\\n              D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way \\n              through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are \\n              old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \\n              face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \\n              Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \\n              human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic \\n              surface of an Art Deco design.\\n              Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\\n                                    C-3PO\\n                        Did you hear that?

This is madness!\\n              Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in \\n              the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\\n                                    C-3PO\\n                        We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doomed!\\n              The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that \\n              only another robot could understand.\\n                                    C-3PO\\n                        There\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be no escape for the Princess \\n                        this time.\\n              Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as \\n              loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment \\n              are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\\n                                    C-3PO\\n                        What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that?\\n              EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\\n              The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade \\n              Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the \\n              underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\\n              INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\\n              The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a \\n              tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and \\n              a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make \\n              their way into the smoke-filled corridor.\\n              In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with \\n              laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \\n              creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \\n              behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers \\n              who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered \\n              arms and faces.\\n              An explosion hits near the robots.\\n                                    C-3PO\\n                        I should have known better than to \\n                        trust the logic of a half-sized \\n                        thermocapsulary dehousing assister\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n              Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages \\n              around the two hapless robots.\\n              EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\\n              A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. \\n              The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone \\n              figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations \\n              who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy \\n              hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable \\n              lad with a prize-winning smile.\\n              A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \\n              large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \\n              desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \\n              by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \\n              appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  \\n              A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye and \\n              he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \\n              utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying \\n              the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \\n              Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \\n              above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \\n              tiny robot to follow him.\\n                                    LUKE\\n                        Hurry up! Come with me! What are you \\n                        waiting for?! Get in gear!\\n              The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and \\n              smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his \\n              arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \\n              into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \\n              madly.\\n              INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY\\n              The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his \\n              way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is \\n              Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \\n              by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \\n              stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \\n              Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \\n              from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \\n              the Rebel troops.

TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET\\n              The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange \\n              foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures \\n              fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock \\n              canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he \\n              goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for \\n              a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\\n              In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall \\n              and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little \\n              further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a \\n              pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the \\n              narrow path.\\n              The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until \\n              suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out \\n              of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages \\n              one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his \\n              back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then \\n              off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller \\n              than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they \\n              cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and \\n              their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be \\n              seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave \\n              the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down \\n              the trail.\\n              EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\\n              The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-\\n              like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a \\n              small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a \\n              large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot \\n              is sucked into the giant machine.\\n              The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders \\n              and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\\n              INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA\\n              It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo \\n              switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles \\n              around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty \\n              metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and \\n              maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper \\n              and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end \\n              of the chamber.\\n              INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA\\n              Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the \\n              middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various \\n              shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, \\n              while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls \\n              out from the gloom.\\n                                    THREEPIO\\n                        Artoo-Detoo! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s you!

TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\\n              The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent \\n              twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain \\n              ridge.\\n              EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY\\n              Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-\\n              buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. \\n              A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.\\n                                    FIRST TROOPER\\n                        Someone was in the pod.

SANDCRAWLER\\n              Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped \\n              prison chamber.

TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON\\n              The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their \\n              battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of \\n              the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small \\n              homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground \\n              surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small \\n              adobe block house.\\n              The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening \\n              them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. \\n              The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting \\n              small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils \\n              should be.\\n              Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, \\n              a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are \\n              sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully \\n              inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- \\n              shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little \\n              Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales \\n              pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.\\n              A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the \\n              homestead.

Threepio is startled \\n              and backs away, right off the side if the cliff.

His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\\n              covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  \\n              Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, \\n              and little else.

Luke and \\n              Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are \\n              blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of \\n              laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser \\n              gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the \\n              last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is \\n              about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink \\n              system, which is screeching questions about what is going \\n              on.

All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.\\n\\nANAKIN: Here we go.\\n\\nThe Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'m going high and right.\\n\\nANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m coming around. I\\'m coming around on your tail.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.\\n\\nIn one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.\\n\\nARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.\\n\\nANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that\\'s not good.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know. I know!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know. I know!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Break right and go high.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m going low and left.\\n\\nObi-Wan shakes his head.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.\\n\\nANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.\\n\\nANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I\\'m going to pull them through the needle . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: \"Survive.\"\\n\\nANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.\\n\\nOBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.\\n\\nOBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) You\\'ll never get through there, Anakin. It\\'s too tight.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS nervously.\\n\\nANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we\\'ve done this before.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.\\n\\nARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo\\'s squeal reads out, \"WE\\'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.\"\\n\\nANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.\\n\\nANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) I\\'m through.\\n\\nOBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION. \\nA CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space. \\nFinally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.\\n\\nODD BALL: There are too many of them.\\n\\nCLONE PILOT 2: I\\'m on your wing. Break left. Break left. They\\'re all over me. Get them off my . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m going to go help them out!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!\\n\\nAnother CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.\\n\\nANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: They overshot us . . .\\n\\nThe second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan\\'s ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.\\n\\nANAKIN: They\\'re coming around!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.\\n\\nANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.\\n\\nANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.\\n\\nANAKIN: We got \\'em. Artoo!\\n\\nTwo missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.\\n\\nSuddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I\\'m hit! Anakin?\\n\\nANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.\\n\\nThe BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan\\'s ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .\\n\\nARFOUR\\'s head gets ripped off and flies away.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh dear. They\\'re shutting down all the controls.\\n\\nANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I\\'m running out of tricks here.\\n\\nANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan\\'s left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan\\'s ship.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...\\n\\nANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You\\'re not helping here.\\n\\nANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can\\'t see a thing! My cockpit\\'s fogging. They\\'re all over me, Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: Move to the right.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You\\'re going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There\\'s nothing more you can do.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not leaving without you, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN\\'s and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN\\'s ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan\\'s ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi\\'s view.\\n\\nANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin\\'s ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can\\'t see . . . my controls are gone.\\n\\nANAKIN: Get \\'em, Artoo. Watch out!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid\\'s center eye.\\n\\nARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.\\n\\nANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General\\'s Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?\\n\\nANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN\\'s disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.\\n\\n9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.\\n\\nANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut. \\nOBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.\\n\\nANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.\\n\\nANAKIN: Tap into the ship\\'s computers.\\n\\nThey cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Chancellor\\'s signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.\\n\\nANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I sense a trap.\\n\\nANAKIN: Next move?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Spring the trap.\\n\\nThe JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.\\n\\nOBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.\\n\\n10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: What\\'s the situation, Captain?\\n\\nCAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.\\n\\n11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'s BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.\\n\\nBODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We\\'ve been waiting for you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.\\n\\nAs a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin. . .\\n\\nANAKIN: Ready.\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.\\n\\n12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That\\'s why they\\'ve stopped shooting.\\n\\nANAKIN: Well then, we\\'re safe for the time being.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.\\n\\nThey run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.\\n\\nANAKIN: They\\'re sealing this section off.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!\\n\\nThe last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.\\n\\nANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.\\n\\nThey move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We\\'ll never get through that. It\\'s too small!\\n\\nThey move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.\\n\\nThe fuel is up to the Jedi\\'s chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.\\n\\nANAKIN: I found our escape vent.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We\\'re in serious trouble here.\\n\\nANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .\\n\\nANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a \"man-sized\" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.\\n\\n13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.\\n\\nANAKIN: Here\\'s a way out.\\n\\nAs the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.\\n\\n14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.\\n\\n15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nA hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: That won\\'t hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.\\n\\nANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side\\'s pressurized.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.\\n\\n16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.\\n\\n17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.\\n\\n18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE\\n\\nA GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.\\n\\n19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nA large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let\\'s go!\\n\\nANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.\\n\\n20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.\\n\\nANAKIN: Destroyers!!\\n\\nFinally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.\\n\\nBATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop \\'em.\\n\\nThe JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.\\n\\n21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nR2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.\\n\\n22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button?\\n\\nANAKIN: No, did you?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No!\\n\\nANAKIN: Well, there\\'s more than one way out of here.\\n\\nANAKIN ignites his laser sword.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We don\\'t want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . .\\n\\nANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.\\n\\n23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nTWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan\\'s voice over the comlink and are distracted.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What\\'s that?\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It\\'s nothing.\\n\\n24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Artoo?\\n\\nANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.\\n\\nOBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.\\n\\n25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.\\n\\n26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nSuddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.\\n\\n27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe elevator starts to descend rapidly.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.\\n\\n28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAnakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.\\n\\nDROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don\\'t move.\\n\\nDROID 2: Roger, roger.\\n\\n29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN\\'s comlink messages to ARTOO.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: There it is again.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.\\n\\n30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!\\n\\nThe elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.\\n\\n31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: Hey you!\\n\\nARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.\\n\\n32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Now, that\\'s better . . .\\n\\n33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: You stupid little astro droid!\\n\\n34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.\\n\\nBefore ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, it\\'s you . . .\\n\\n35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.\\n\\n36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN: What was that all about?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He\\'s doing the best he can.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Did I say anything?\\n\\nANAKIN: He\\'s trying!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I didn\\'t say anything!\\n\\n37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.\\n\\n38 INT. GENERAL\\'S QUARTER\\'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General\\'s Quarters. \\nAt the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR. \\nAs they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor\\'s face.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.\\n\\nANAKIN: Are you all right?\\n\\nPALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.\\n\\nPALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.\\n\\nANAKIN: I was about to say that.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Get help! You\\'re no match for him. He\\'s a Sith Lord.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don\\'t want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You won\\'t get away this time, Dooku.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: I\\'ve been looking forward to this.\\n\\nANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.\\n\\nDOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You\\'ll have to do better.\\n\\nAs the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force. \\nANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General\\'s Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking. \\nANAKIN hits the archway. \\nDOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use them.\\n\\nAnakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense. \\nAnakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.\\n\\n39 INT. GENERAL\\'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAnakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU\\'s hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord\\'s hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU\\'s defeat.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!\\n\\nANAKIN: I shouldn\\'t . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Do it!!\\n\\nANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU\\'s head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.\\n\\nANAKIN: ... I couldn\\'t stop myself.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.\\n\\nANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU\\'s lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.\\n\\nANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral\\'s Chair. The Chancellor\\'s restraints pop loose.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn\\'t have done that, Chancellor. It\\'s not the Jedi way.\\n\\nPALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.\\n\\nPALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn\\'t the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.\\n\\nThe ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it\\'s too late.\\n\\nANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing\\'s all right.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Leave him, or we\\'ll never make it.\\n\\nANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.\\n\\nANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.\\n\\n40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare for attack.\\n\\nPILOT: All batteries fire! Fire!\\n\\n41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER\\n\\nClone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying.\\n\\n42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL\\'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.\\n\\nANAKIN: The elevator\\'s not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.\\n\\nSuddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!\\n\\n43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nWindows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space.\\n\\nPILOT: Reverse stabilizers.\\n\\n44 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAs the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other. \\nSeveral objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.\\n\\n45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL\\'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAs the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway. \\nANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.\\n\\n46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.\\n\\n47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nPILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize!\\n\\n48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.\\n\\n49 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT\\n\\nThe TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward the planet.\\n\\n50 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL\\'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.\\n\\nANAKIN: We can\\'t wait. Come on, we have to be fast.\\n\\nPALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.\\n\\n51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines.\\n\\nPILOT: Leveling out, sir.\\n\\n52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi\\'s leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.\\n\\n53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.\\n\\nANAKIN: Easy. . . . We\\'re in a bit of a situation.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Did I miss something?\\n\\nOBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan\\'s comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.\\n\\nANAKINN: Hold on.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: What is that?\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!\\n\\nThey fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal. \\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.\\n\\n54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Let\\'s see if we can find something in the hangar bay that\\'s still flyable. Come on.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?\\n\\n55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAs the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.\\n\\n56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.\\n\\n57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nIt is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.\\n\\nANAKIN: I agree.\\n\\nPALPATINE: What are we going to do?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Don\\'t look at me. I don\\'t know.\\n\\nANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin\\'s Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.\\n\\nANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We\\'ll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.\\n\\nANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.\\n\\n58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.\\n\\n59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.\\n\\nANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\n60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nBODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They\\'re in hallway 328.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields.\\n\\n61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThey run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.\\n\\nANAKIN: Ray shields!\\n\\nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how\\'d this happen! We\\'re smarter than this.\\n\\nANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it\\'s my fault.\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re the Master. I\\'m just a hero.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'m open to suggestions here.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Why don\\'t we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku\\'s demise, we can negotiate our release.\\n\\nThe Jedi look at each other in disbelief.\\n\\nANAKIN: I say . . . patience.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Patience! That\\'s your plan, is it?\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he\\'ll release the ray shields . . .\\n\\nARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.\\n\\nSuddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS. \\nARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID: Don\\'t move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?\\n\\n62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We\\'ve been waiting for you. That wasn\\'t much of a rescue.\\n\\nA BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI\\'S lightsabers.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.\\n\\nANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You\\'re shorter than I expected.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won\\'t escape.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo.\\n\\nARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around. \\nOBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General\\'s hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!\\n\\nANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General\\'s hand.\\n\\nThe DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'s TWO BODYGUARDS.\\n\\nCHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.\\n\\nOBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous\\'s BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge. \\nOBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD\\'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.\\nANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor. \\nOBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces. \\nALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\\n\\nPILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don\\'t bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD\\'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.\\n\\nOne of the PILOTS stands next to the General.\\n\\nPILOT: The ship is breaking up!\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: We\\'ve run out of time.\\n\\nOBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship. \\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.\\n\\n63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN. \\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.\\n\\nPALPATINE: The hull is burning up!\\n\\n64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.\\n\\n65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Time to abandon ship.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned.\\n\\n66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE\\n\\nHe gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged Cruiser.\\n\\n67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator\\'s chair.\\n\\nANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?\\n\\nANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what\\'s left of this thing?\\n\\nANAKIN sits in the pilot\\'s chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well?\\n\\nANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I\\'d say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine \\'s controls and assists in flying the cruiser.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.\\n\\nARTOO beeps.\\n\\nANAKIN: Pressure rising. We\\'ve got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .\\n\\nA large part of the ship breaks away.\\n\\nANAKIN: We lost something.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Not to worry, we\\'re still flying half the ship.\\n\\nANAKIN: Now we\\'re really picking up speed . . . I\\'m going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Careful . . . we\\'re heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: What\\'s our speed?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we\\'re in the atmosphere . . .\\n\\nANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.\\n\\nANAKIN: Grab that . . . Keep us level.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Steady. Steady.\\n\\nANAKIN: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.\\n\\nFlRESHIP PILOT: We\\'ll take you in.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Copy that. Landing strip\\'s straight ahead.\\n\\nANAKIN: We\\'re coming in too hot.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Easy-easy.\\n\\nThe ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.\\n\\n68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOON\\n\\nA large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Another happy landing.\\n\\n69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.\\n\\nANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh no. I\\'m not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.\\n\\nANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let\\'s be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.\\n\\nANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn\\'t count. I\\'ll see you at the briefing.\\n\\nANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN. \\nThe CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.\\n\\nPALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.\\n\\nBAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.\\n\\nANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.\\n\\nANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.\\n\\nARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.\\n\\nC-3PO: It couldn\\'t possibly be as bad as all that.\\n\\nARTOO beeps.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.\\n\\n70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor\\'s draconian security measures.\\n\\nANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.\\n\\nBehind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: I\\'ll do everything I can with the Senate.\\n\\nANAKIN: Excuse me.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Certainly.\\n\\nANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.\\n\\nPADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you\\'re back.\\n\\nANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I\\'ve missed you so.\\n\\nPADME: There were whispers . . . that you\\'d been killed. I\\'ve been living with unbearable dread.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m back, I\\'m all right. It feels like we\\'ve been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn\\'t been kidnapped. I don\\'t think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.\\n\\nANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.\\n\\nPADME: Wait, not here . . .\\n\\nHe grabs her again.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, here! I\\'m tired of all this deception. I don\\'t care if they know we\\'re married.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, don\\'t say things like that. You\\'re important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won\\'t let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'ve given my life to the Jedi order, but I\\'d only give up my life, for you.\\n\\nPADME: (playfully) I wouldn\\'t like that. I wouldn\\'t like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.\\n\\nANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.\\n\\nANAKIN: Are you all right? You\\'re trembling. What\\'s going on?\\n\\nPADME: I\\'m just excited to see you.\\n\\nANAKIN: That\\'s not it. I sense more . . . what is it?\\n\\nPADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what\\'s going on!\\n\\nPADME begins to cry.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'ve been gone five months . . . it\\'s been very hard for me. I\\'ve never felt so alone. There\\'s . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?\\n\\nPADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don\\'t trust me. Nothing has changed.\\n\\nANAKIN: (sheepish) I\\'m afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that\\'s all.\\n\\nPADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.\\n\\nANAKIN: It\\'s just that I\\'ve never seen you like this . . .\\n\\nPADME: Something wonderful has happened.\\n\\nThey look at each other for a long moment.\\n\\nPADME: (continuing) I\\'m . . . Annie, I\\'m pregnant.\\n\\nANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.\\n\\nANAKIN: That\\'s . . . that\\'s wonderful.\\n\\nPADME: What are we going to do?\\n\\nANAKIN: We\\'re not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.\\n\\n71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nA small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.\\n\\n72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY\\n\\nA hologram of Darth Sidious appears.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Yes, Lord Sidious.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.\\n\\nThe hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.\\n\\n73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT\\n\\nPADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.\\n\\nANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I\\'ve never been so happy as I am at this moment.\\n\\nPADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby\\'s room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.\\n\\nANAKIN: You are so beautiful!\\n\\nPADME: It\\'s only because I\\'m so in love . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: No, it\\'s because I\\'m so in love with you.\\n\\nPADME: So love has blinded you?\\n\\nANAKIN: Well, that\\'s not exactly what I meant . . .\\n\\nPADME: But it\\'s probably true!\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\nANAKIN: I haven\\'t laughed in so long . . .\\n\\nPADME: Neither have I.\\n\\n74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM\\n\\nThe view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.\\n\\nShe screams and dies.\\n\\n75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin??\\n\\nShe gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.\\n\\n76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught. \\nPADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn\\'t look at her.\\n\\nPADME: What\\'s bothering you?\\n\\nANAKIN: Nothing . . .\\n\\nANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME\\'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?\\n\\nANAKIN: It was a dream.\\n\\nPADME: Bad?\\n\\nANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.\\n\\nPADME: And?\\n\\nANAKIN: It was about you.\\n\\nThey look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.\\n\\nPADME: Tell me.\\n\\nANAKIN: It was only a dream.\\n\\nPADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . .\\n\\nPADME: And the baby?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nPADME: It was only a dream.\\n\\nANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.\\n\\nANAKIN: . . . I won\\'t let this one become real, Padme.\\n\\nThey embrace, then part.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know \\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?\\n\\nANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?\\n\\nPADME: No, but he\\'s your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.\\n\\nANAKIN: He\\'s been a father to me, but he\\'s still on the Council. Don\\'t tell him anything!\\n\\nPADME: I won\\'t, Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.\\n\\n77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY\\n\\nYODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda \\'s room, deep in thought.\\n\\nYODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .\\n\\nYODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?\\n\\nANAKIN: Someone . . .\\n\\nYODA: . . . close to you?\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes.\\n\\nYODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.\\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t let these visions come true, Master Yoda.\\n\\nYODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.\\n\\nANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda?\\n\\nYODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\\n\\n78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.\\n\\n79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.\\n\\nANAKIN: What\\'s wrong then?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.\\n\\nANAKIN: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.\\n\\nANAKIN: Be careful of what?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He has requested your presence.\\n\\nANAKIN: What for?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He would not say.\\n\\nANAKIN: He didn\\'t inform the Jedi Council? That\\'s unusual, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it\\'s making me feel uneasy. You\\'re probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor\\'s power, mine also for that matter. Aren\\'t we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.\\n\\n80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?\\n\\nPALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.\\n\\nANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.\\n\\nPALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.\\n\\nANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.\\n\\nANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin, I\\'ve known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: Of course.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I need your help, son.\\n\\nANAKIN: What do you mean?\\n\\nPALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They\\'re shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.\\n\\nANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I\\'m depending on you.\\n\\nANAKIN: For what? I don\\'t understand.\\n\\nPALPATINE: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .\\n\\nANAKIN thinks about this.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin . . . I\\'m appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.\\n\\nANAKIN: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.\\n\\n81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA\\'S OFFICE-DAY\\n\\nPADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa \\'s office.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.\\n\\nFANG ZAR: When did this happen?\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.\\n\\nPADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.\\n\\nGIDDEAN DANU: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We can\\'t let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.\\n\\nEVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.\\n\\nTERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn\\'t mean to sound like a Separatist.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.\\n\\nGlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We can\\'t sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .\\n\\nPADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it\\'s better to leave some things unsaid.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.\\n\\nThey ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.\\n\\nPADME: Agreed.\\n\\n82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.\\n\\n83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI.\\n\\nMACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor\\'s personal representative.\\n\\nANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.\\n\\nYODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.\\n\\nANAKIN: I understand.\\n\\nMACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.\\n\\nAnakin reacts with anger.\\n\\nANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it\\'s unfair . . . I\\'m more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?\\n\\nMACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker.\\n\\nANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.\\n\\nYODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.\\n\\nMACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.\\n\\nYODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?\\n\\nMACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He\\'s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It\\'s the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.\\n\\nMACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.\\n\\nYODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.\\n\\nMACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.\\n\\nANAKIN is disappointed.\\n\\n84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.\\n\\nANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That\\'s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It\\'s insulting!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It\\'s never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you\\'re too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn\\'t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.\\n\\nANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn\\'t ask to be put on the Council . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: But it\\'s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.\\n\\nANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.\\n\\nANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn\\'t you listen? You walked right into it.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Council is upset I\\'m the youngest to ever serve.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They\\'re dangerous, dark thoughts.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I hope so . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I sense there\\'s more to this talk than you\\'re saying.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.\\n\\nANAKIN: And?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn\\'t want to see you put in this situation.\\n\\nANAKIN: What situation?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor\\'s dealings. They want to know what he\\'s up to.\\n\\nANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That\\'s treason!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.\\n\\nANAKIN: Why didn\\'t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He\\'s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That\\'s what\\'s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.\\n\\n85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nA JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.\\n\\n86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY\\n\\nYODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.\\n\\nYODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.\\n\\nMACE: It\\'s very dangerous, putting them together. I don\\'t think the boy can handle it. I don\\'t trust him.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He\\'ll be all right. I trust him with my life.\\n\\nMACE:I wish I did.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?\\n\\nMACE: So the prophecy says.\\n\\nYODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.\\n\\nYODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.\\n\\nThe GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.\\n\\n87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET\\n\\nPadme\\'s Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.\\n\\nPADME: Thank you, Captain.\\n\\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.\\n\\nCAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.\\n\\nPADME: I\\'ll be up in a while.\\n\\nMOTEE: Yes, my lady.\\n\\nC-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.\\n\\nC-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?\\n\\nPADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.\\n\\nThe golden droid turns and exits.\\n\\nPADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.\\n\\nANAKIN: Beautiful, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nPADME jumps and turns around.\\n\\nPADME: You startled me.\\n\\nHe sits next to her on the bench.\\n\\nANAKIN: How are you feeling?\\n\\nPADME: He keeps kicking.\\n\\nANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it\\'s a boy?\\n\\nPADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition.\\n\\nShe puts his hand on her belly.\\n\\nANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it\\'s got to be a girl.\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\nPADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I\\'m so proud of you.\\n\\nANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.\\n\\nPADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.\\n\\nANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that\\'s the problem.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what\\'s happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.\\n\\nPADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?\\n\\nANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean?\\n\\nPADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t believe that. And you\\'re sounding like a Separatist!\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you\\'re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.\\n\\nANAKIN: (growing angry) Don\\'t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I\\'m not your errand boy. I\\'m not anyone\\'s errand boy!\\n\\nPADME: What is it?\\n\\nANAKIN: Nothing.\\n\\nPADME: Don\\'t do this . . . don\\'t shut me out. Let me help you.\\n\\nANAKIN: You can\\'t help me . . . I\\'m trying to help you.\\n\\nThey look in each other\\'s eyes.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.\\n\\nPADME is startled at this.\\n\\nPADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.\\n\\nPADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.\\n\\nPADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.\\n\\n88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN lands his speeder and exits. \\nANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House. \\nANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine\\'s box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing \"Squid Lake.\"\\n\\nANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.\\n\\nANAKIN: At last, we\\'ll be able to capture that monster and end this war.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn\\'t select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 but, they can\\'t always be trusted to do the right thing.\\n\\nANAKIN: They try.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.\\n\\nANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I\\'m not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven\\'t included you in their plot, they soon will.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not sure I understand.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they\\'re planning to betray me.\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t think . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don\\'t you?\\n\\nANAKIN: I know they don\\'t trust you . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.\\n\\nANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn\\'t they?\\n\\nANAKIN doesn\\'t say anything. He simply looks down.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn\\'t they?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know ... I don\\'t know what to say.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .\\n\\nANAKIN: . . . evil.\\n\\nPALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi\\'s point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.\\n\\nPALPATINE: And the Jedi don\\'t?\\n\\nANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.\\n\\nPALPATINE smiles.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Or so you\\'ve been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not sure it\\'s wrong.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.\\n\\nANAKIN is deep in thought.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \"the wise\"?\\n\\nANAKIN: No.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I thought not. It\\'s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\\'s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.\\n\\nANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?\\n\\nPALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\\n\\nANAKIN: What happened to him?\\n\\nPALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It\\'s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\\n\\nANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.\\n\\n89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY\\n\\nA WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.\\n\\n90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY\\n\\nYODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.\\n\\nMACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.\\n\\nANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.\\n\\nYODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?\\n\\nAll the JEDI concur.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.\\n\\nThey all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.\\n\\nMACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.\\n\\nANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.\\n\\nYODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.\\n\\nMACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.\\n\\nANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.\\n\\nOBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I\\'m only stating a fact.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh no, you\\'re quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.\\n\\nYODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.\\n\\nYODA: I agree.\\n\\nAll the JEDI concur.\\n\\nMACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.\\n\\nANAKIN is angry.\\n\\nMACE: (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there\\'s no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.\\n\\n91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY\\n\\nYODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators.\\n\\nYODA: Then now the time is, Commander.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe battle begins.\\n\\n92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY\\n\\nA WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.\\n\\n93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING\\n\\nPadme\\'s apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.\\n\\n94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING\\n\\nPADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?\\n\\nPADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'re not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'re not very good at hiding your feelings.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: It\\'s Anakin . . . He\\'s becoming moody and detached. He\\'s been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor\\'s representative . . . but I think it\\'s more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.\\n\\nPADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?\\n\\nOBI-WAN studies her.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.\\n\\nPADME: Don\\'t give me that look.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.\\n\\nPADME: (nervous) What did he say?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn\\'t have to.\\n\\nPADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.\\n\\nPADME: I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I\\'m worried about him.\\n\\nPADME looks down and doesn\\'t answer.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He\\'s changed considerably since we returned . . .\\n\\nThey stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I\\'m not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn\\'t upset you. We\\'re all friends, I care about both of you . . .\\n\\nPADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.\\n\\n95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-DAY\\n\\nPADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme\\'s living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.\\n\\nPADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that\\'s all.\\n\\nPADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.\\n\\nBANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: We don\\'t know where the Jedi stand in all this.\\n\\nPADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.\\n\\nGiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.\\n\\nPADME: The Jedi aren\\'t any happier with the situation than we are . . .\\n\\nCHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.\\n\\nFANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.\\n\\nBANA BREEMU: When you present the \"petition of the two thousand\" to the Chancellor, things may change.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.\\n\\nPADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.\\n\\n96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re going to need me on this one, Master.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.\\n\\nOBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master!\\n\\nOBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I\\'ve disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I\\'ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won\\'t be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.\\n\\nOBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Don\\'t worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I\\'ll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.\\n\\nANAKIN: Well, there\\'s always a first time.\\n\\nOBI-WAN laughs.\\n\\nThey talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.\\n\\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.\\n\\n97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.\\n\\n98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE\\n\\nCLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'ll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don\\'t take too long.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.\\n\\nOBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: I\\'m counting on you.\\n\\n99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.\\n\\n100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR\\'S TRANSPORT-DAY\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\'s Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?\\n\\nANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous\\'s head.\\n\\nPALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn\\'t make a mistake.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.\\n\\nThey exit the landing platform.\\n\\n101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nThey enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.\\n\\nJAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .\\n\\nThe Gungan waves to Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.\\n\\nJAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.\\n\\nAnakin turns back to the Chancellor.\\n\\nPALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.\\n\\nANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?\\n\\nPALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.\\n\\nANAKIN: That\\'s ridiculous. Who?!?\\n\\nPALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.\\n\\nANAKIN: That\\'s impossible. I would know.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.\\n\\nANAKIN becomes worried.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I\\'m sure your Master will do fine.\\n\\n102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM\\n\\nPADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Save your energy.\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Don\\'t give up, Padme. Don\\'t give up . . .\\n\\n103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.\\n\\nANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan\\'s been here, hasn\\'t he?\\n\\nPADME: He came by this morning.\\n\\nANAKIN: What did he want?\\n\\nPADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.\\n\\nPADME: He\\'s worried about you.\\n\\nANAKIN: You told him about us, didn\\'t you?\\n\\nShe continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.\\n\\nPADME: He\\'s your best friend, Anakin. He says you\\'re under a lot of stress.\\n\\nANAKIN: And he\\'s not?\\n\\nPADME: You have been moody lately.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not moody . . .\\n\\nPADME: Anakin! Don\\'t do this again.\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know ... I feel . . . lost.\\n\\nPADME: Lost? What do you mean? You\\'re always so sure of yourself. I don\\'t understand.\\n\\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don\\'t trust me.\\n\\nPADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.\\n\\nANAKIN: Something\\'s happening . . . I\\'m not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I\\'m not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn\\'t.\\n\\nPADME: You expect too much of yourself.\\n\\nThey stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.\\n\\nANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.\\n\\nPADME: Save me?\\n\\nANAKIN: From my nightmares.\\n\\nPADME: Is that what\\'s bothering you?\\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t lose you, Padme.\\n\\nPADME: I\\'m not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.\\n\\nANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.\\n\\nPADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.\\n\\nPADME: You don\\'t need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.\\n\\nThey embrace and kiss.\\n\\n104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER\\'s hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet\\'s surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.\\n\\n105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS\\'s BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you\\'ve brought it with you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.\\n\\nA GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I understand.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.\\n\\nOBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS\\'s BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I\\'m staying here. Tell Cody I\\'ve made contact.\\n\\nThe little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.\\n\\n106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY\\n\\nOn a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'s BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel.\\n\\nBODYGUARD: What was his name?\\n\\nTlON MEDON: He didn\\'t say.\\n\\nThey watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.\\n\\n107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.\\n\\n108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It\\'s hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.\\n\\n109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates. \\nHe comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around. \\nOBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I need transportation.\\n\\nWRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Get it for me.\\n\\nWRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.\\n\\nOne of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: This one.\\n\\nThe WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.\\n\\nWRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga.\\n\\nOBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.\\n\\n110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY\\n\\nThe LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.\\n\\n111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won\\'t be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.\\n\\nOBI-WAN is deep in thought.\\n\\n112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nThe JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Hello, there!\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you\\'re doomed, (to droids) Kill him!\\n\\nAbout a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS. \\nThey stare at each other for a moment.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.\\n\\nThe BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi\\'s lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury. \\nOBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your move.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.\\n\\nHis arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!\\n\\nOBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS\\'s hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nTWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard\\'s electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.\\n\\n113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nMore CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS. \\nThe JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.\\n\\n114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.\\n\\n115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET\\n\\nThe sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.\\n\\n116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-SUNSET\\n\\nPALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.\\n\\nPADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?\\n\\nPALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .\\n\\nPADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.\\n\\nFANGZAR: But surely . . .\\n\\nThe Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.\\n\\nPADME: On behalf of the \"delegation of two thousand,\" I thank you, Chancellor.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.\\n\\nPADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.\\n\\nANAKIN: What do you mean?\\n\\nPALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.\\n\\nANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m sure you\\'re mistaken.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I\\'m surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.\\n\\nANAKIN: I simply don\\'t sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.\\n\\nPALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don\\'t seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.\\n\\n117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nKI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we \\nhave begun our attack.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his \\nintentions.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY\\'s hologram disappears.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from \\noffice.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.\\n\\nYODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.\\n\\n118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.\\n\\nANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.\\n\\nPALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.\\n\\nANAKIN: I should be there with him.\\n\\nPALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn\\'t seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don\\'t you wonder why they won\\'t make you a Jedi Master?\\n\\nANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.\\n\\nPALPATINE: They don\\'t trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.\\n\\nThey walk into the hallway.\\n\\nANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?\\n\\nPALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.\\n\\nThey stop.\\n\\nANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.\\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.\\n\\nANAKIN: What did you say?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re a Sith Lord!\\n\\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don\\'t continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I\\'ve known you, you\\'ve been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re wrong!\\n\\nPALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?\\n\\nANAKIN: I would certainly like to.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.\\n\\nANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE\\'s throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.\\n\\nANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Of course you should. But you\\'re not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?\\n\\nANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.\\n\\nANAKIN stares at him for a moment. \\nPALPATINE turns and moves to his office.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you\\'ll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE sits behind his desk.\\n\\n119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.\\n\\n120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY\\n\\nA LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan\\'s LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.\\n\\n121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan\\'s access to the General. Obi-Wan\\'s LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.\\n\\nOBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\\n\\nThe GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan\\'s LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.\\n\\n122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid\\'s electronic staff.\\n\\n123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nExtending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.\\n\\nOBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General\\'s scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General\\'s electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.\\n\\nOBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'s stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form\\'s guts encased in a bag in the Droid\\'s chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid\\'s laser pistol.\\n\\nThe JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: So uncivilized . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.\\n\\n124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nMACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR\\'s office. ANAKIN enters the hangar.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master Windu, I must talk to you.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.\\n\\nANAKIN: He won\\'t give up his power. I\\'ve just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: A Sith Lord?\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: How do you know this?\\n\\nANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: Are you sure?\\n\\nANAKIN: Absolutely.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.\\n\\nANAKIN: I must go, Master.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.\\n\\n125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME\\'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING\\n\\n(INTERCUT)\\n\\nPADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (V.O.) You do know, don\\'t you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.\\n\\nPADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.\\n\\nC-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?\\n\\nANAKIN: I can\\'t do this ... I can\\'t let her die.\\n\\nANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off.\\n\\n126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nThe sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform. \\nFOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across.\\n\\n127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nThe FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor\\'s aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor\\'s office.\\n\\n128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\xe2\\x80\\x99S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nMACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you\\'re here sooner than expected.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.\\n\\nMACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?\\n\\nMACE: The Senate will decide your fate.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!\\n\\nMACE: Not yet!\\n\\nPALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.\\n\\nPALPATINE: It\\'s treason, then.\\n\\nA close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.\\n\\nJedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.\\n\\nANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor\\'s office.\\n\\nIn the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor\\'s desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.\\n\\nThey stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: No! No! You will die!\\n\\nPALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE\\'s lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.\\n\\nPALPATINE: He is a traitor, Anakin.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: He\\'s the traitor. Stop him!\\n\\nPALPATINE: Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: You are not one of them, Anakin. Don\\'t let him kill me.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Don\\'t listen to him, Anakin.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Help me! Don\\'t let him kill me. I can\\'t hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .\\n\\nMACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine\\'s hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor\\'s face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I can\\'t ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don\\'t kill me. I give up. I\\'m dying. I can\\'t hold on any longer.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.\\n\\nANAKIN: You can\\'t kill him, Master. He must stand trial.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I\\'m too weak. Don\\'t kill me. Please.\\n\\nANAKIN: It is not the Jedi way . . .\\n\\nMACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) He must live . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Please don\\'t, please don\\'t . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I need him . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Please don\\'t . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: NO!!!\\n\\nJust as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi\\'s hand holding the lightsaber.\\n\\nAs MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life. \\nThe full force of Palpatine\\'s powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Power! Unlimited power!\\n\\nHis face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.\\n\\nANAKIN: What have I done?\\n\\nANAKIN sits.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nANAKIN: I will do whatever you ask.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Good.\\n\\nANAKIN: Just help me save Padme\\'s life. I can\\'t live without her. I won\\'t let her die. I want the power to stop death.\\n\\nPALPATINE: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.\\n\\nANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.\\n\\nANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.\\n\\nANAKIN: Thank you. my Master.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Rise, Darth Vader.\\n\\nPalpatine moves over to his desk.\\n\\n129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY\\n\\nYODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a disturbance in the Force.\\n\\n130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-EVENING\\n\\nPALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak: he is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.\\n\\nANAKIN: I agree. The Jedi\\'s next move will be against the Senate.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don\\'t you?\\n\\nANAKIN: I understand, Master.\\n\\nPALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.\\n\\nANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.\\n\\n131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers.\\n\\n132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you\\'ll be needing this.\\n\\nHe hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let\\'s get a move on. We\\'ve got a battle to win here.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir!\\n\\nOBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole. \\nThe battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\nThe HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him!\\n\\nThe battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him. \\nOBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.\\n\\n133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN\\n\\nThe sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . .\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He\\'s killed before he can defend himself.\\n\\n134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY\\n\\nA column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.\\n\\nAAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . .\\n\\nThey all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi.\\n\\nAAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they\\'re Droids?\\n\\nBLY: No.\\n\\nBLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground.\\n\\nAnother Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away.\\n\\n135 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY\\n\\nYODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a wall.\\n\\n136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY\\n\\nThe battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react.\\n\\nThe Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES. \\nThe cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION.\\n\\n137 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-COCKPIT CLONE FIGHTER-DAY\\n\\nThe CLONE PILOT watches a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Execute Order Sixty-Six.\\n\\nCLONE PILOT: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\n138 INT.

CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-NIGHT\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, My Lord.\\n\\nDABTH SIDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\\n\\n142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY\\n\\nA vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank-like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.\\n\\nYODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire.\\n\\nBut faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.\\n\\n143 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT\\n\\nA JEDI is surrounded and gunned down by CLONE TROOPERS.\\n\\n144 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN walks through the Jedi Temple, where he finds and kills SHAAK TI. \\nHe exits Shaak Ti\\'s room and enters a hallway, where the battle is taking place.\\n\\n145 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner.\\n\\nYOUNGLINGS: Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?\\n\\nANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\n146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nC-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window.\\n\\nC-3PO: The Chancellor\\'s office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don\\'t worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.\\n\\nPADME bursts into tears.\\n\\n147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nThe city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA\\'s Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke.\\n\\n148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nThe Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: What\\'s going on here?!?\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: There\\'s been a rebellion. Don\\'t worry, sir, the situation is under control.\\n\\nThe CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) I\\'m sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.\\n\\nThe CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) It\\'s time for you to leave, sir.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: And so it is.\\n\\nBAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at BAIL.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER APPO: Get him! Shoot him!\\n\\nSEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser \\npistol.\\n\\nThe YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot.\\n\\nThe Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.\\n\\n149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away.\\n\\n150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY\\n\\nThe Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.\\n\\n151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.\\n\\nOBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.\\n\\nThe NOS MONSTER\\'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.\\n\\nThe SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system.\\n\\n152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK\\n\\nCLONES in modified one-man AT-ST\\'s and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST\\'s spots something floating in the water. It is what\\'s left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.\\n\\nAT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there!\\n\\nA CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.\\n\\nCREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something?\\n\\nCREATURE: It\\'s nothing, nothing. (laughs)\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: It\\'s nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.\\n\\nCLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.\\n\\nSuddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS.\\n\\nCREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.\\n\\nTARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda.\\n\\nYODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.\\n\\nYODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.\\n\\nYODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .\\n\\nYODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect\\'s back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.\\n\\n153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK\\n\\nThe AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches. \\nThe ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.\\n\\nYODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are.

We\\'ve encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.\\n\\n157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.\\n\\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi?\\n\\nCLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall.\\n\\nHe watches them pass.\\n\\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship.\\n\\nCLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.\\n\\nOBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs.\\n\\n158 EXT.

Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .\\n\\nA BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.\\n\\nBAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I\\'ve locked on. Repeat.\\n\\nThe FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi??\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We\\'re sending you our coordinates.\\n\\n161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\xe2\\x80\\x99SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nPADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom.\\n\\nC-3PO: My Lady, there\\'s a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.\\n\\nPADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.\\n\\n162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nTHREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN\\'s ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud!\\n\\nPADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.\\n\\nPADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m fine. I\\'m fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.\\n\\nPADME: Captain Typho\\'s here, we\\'re safe. What\\'s happening?\\n\\nC-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.\\n\\nC-3PO: What is going on?\\n\\nARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) You can\\'t be anymore confused than I am.\\n\\nANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t believe that!\\n\\nANAKIN: I couldn\\'t either at first, but it\\'s true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.\\n\\nC-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.\\n\\nC-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS quietly.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we\\'ll be the last to know.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, what are you going to do?\\n\\nANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.\\n\\nANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.\\n\\nANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.\\n\\nPADME: What about Obi-Wan?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he\\'s remained loyal to the Chancellor.\\n\\nPADME: How could this have happened?\\n\\nANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren\\'t the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.\\n\\nPADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.\\n\\nPADME: What are you saying?\\n\\nANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.\\n\\nPADME: What if they start an inquisition? I\\'ve opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?\\n\\nANAKIN: That won\\'t happen. I won\\'t let it.\\n\\nPADME: Oh, Anakin, I\\'m afraid.\\n\\nANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.\\n\\nANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I\\'m going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.\\n\\nThey kiss.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me.\\n\\nPADME: I will.\\n\\nANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.\\n\\nC-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.\\n\\nARTOO beeps.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?\\n\\nPADME: No thank you, Threepio.\\n\\nG-3PO: A snack, perhaps?\\n\\nPADME: No.\\n\\nTHREEPIO starts to move off.\\n\\nC-3PO: I feel so helpless.\\n\\n163 EXT.

OBI-WAN enters and is greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the hallway.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: You made it.\\n\\nYODA: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also?\\n\\nYODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive?\\n\\nYODA: Heard from no one, have we.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That\\'s why I went looking for Yoda.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple?\\n\\nYODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: It\\'s too dangerous to return.\\n\\nYODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.\\n\\nYODA: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.\\n\\n165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY\\n\\nWorkers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.\\n\\n166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nA HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.\\n\\nThe hologram disappears.\\n\\n167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT\\n\\nThe Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant.

MAS AMEDDA appears on screen.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Tell the Chancellor I will be there.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Very well. He will be expecting you.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA\\'s image disappears from the screen.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: It could be a trap.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No, I don\\'t think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.\\n\\nYODA: If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.\\n\\n168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out.\\n\\nGUARD: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Certainly.\\n\\nGUARD: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.\\n\\nGUARD: It would be better if they stayed with you.\\n\\nBAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head for the Jedi Temple.\\n\\n169 EXT. MUSTAFAR-JEDI STARFIGHTER-SPACE\\n\\nANAKIN\\'s Jedi Starfighter heads for the hazy blood-red planet of Mustafar.\\n\\n170 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN flies over the volcanoes of Mustafar and lands his Jedi Starfighter on a complex of Landing Platforms. His cockpit opens as R2-D2 pops from the ship with a happy BEEP.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo . . . stay with the ship.\\n\\nARTOO lets out a sad little BEEP and moves back toward the ship.\\n\\n171 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving on Mustafar.\\n\\n172 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: Welcome, Lord Vader. We\\'ve been expecting you.\\n\\nEveryone in the room looks to him as he raises his hand toward a control panel, and all the exits close. The confused SEPARATISTS look around in bewilderment.\\n\\n173 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LATE DAY\\n\\nSmoke from the smoldering shell of the Jedi Temple fills the air with a brown haze.\\n\\n174 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MAIN ENTRANCE-LATE DAY\\n\\nA DOZEN CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance of the Jedi Temple. Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.\\n\\nYODA: Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.\\n\\n175 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE BUILDING-SUNSET\\n\\nThe awesome Senate Building looms over the city. The endless traffic continues to clutter the skyline.\\n\\n176 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET\\n\\nThe Chancellor is in the podium in the center of the vast arena giving a speech. MAS AMEDDA stands to the right of SIDIOUS. BAIL ORGANA walks through the hallway of the Main Senate Chamber. He enters the Senate Pod of Naboo and sits next to PADME. JAR JAR, CAPTAIN TYPHO and TWO HANDMAIDENS are in the pod also.\\n\\nPALPATINE: . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: I was held up. What\\'s happening?\\n\\nPADME: The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: That\\'s not true!\\n\\nPADME: He\\'s been presenting evidence all afternoon.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.\\n\\nPALPATINE: The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. (applause) Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.\\n\\n(applause)\\n\\nThese have been trying times, but we have passed the test.\\n\\n177 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-SUNSET\\n\\nYODA and OBI-WAN make their way through the Temple, avoiding the HUNDREDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. They use the Force to distract the CLONES when they can.\\nYODA and OBI-WAN walk through the ruins of the Temple until they come across the bodies of some students.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Not even the younglings survived.\\n\\nYODA: Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: . . .Who?? Who could have done this?\\n\\n178 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table.\\n\\nANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.\\n\\nThen POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, SHU MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.\\n\\n179 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET\\n\\nPALPATINE: The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.\\n\\nApplause.\\n\\n180 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nIn the hallway, ANAKIN cuts down DROIDS and SEPARATISTS alike. He is unstoppable. ANAKIN turns his head-his eyes are yellow.\\n\\n181 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET\\n\\nPALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.\\n\\nPALPATINE: The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.\\n\\nThere is a long period of APPLAUSE.\\n\\nPADME: Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.\\n\\nPALPATINE: In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.\\n\\nThere is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .\\n\\nThe Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .\\n\\nThe Senate APPLAUDS.\\n\\nPADME: So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We cannot let this happen.\\n\\nHe starts to stand up. PADME stops him.\\n\\nPADME: Not now! There will be a time.\\n\\n182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY\\n\\nAfter everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.\\n\\nRUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right!\\n\\nRUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.\\n\\n183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: The war is over.

CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT\\n\\nOBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'ve recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.\\n\\nYODA: Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.\\n\\n185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT\\n\\nOBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .\\n\\nYODA: If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I must know the truth, Master.\\n\\nOBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) It can\\'t be . . . It can\\'t be . . .\\n\\nAs ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him.\\n\\nANAKIN: The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, My Master.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.\\n\\nOBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I can\\'t watch any more.\\n\\nOBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments.\\n\\nYODA: Destroy the Sith, we must.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.\\n\\nYODA: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.\\n\\nYODA: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: How could it have come to this?\\n\\nYODA: To question, no time there is.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don\\'t know where to look.\\n\\nYODA: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.\\n\\n186 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON\\n\\nA DC0052 Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of Padme\\'s apartment.\\n\\n187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.\\n\\nC-3PO: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it\\'s you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.\\n\\nThe security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been here . . . ?\\n\\nC-3PO: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.\\n\\nPADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.\\n\\nPADME: Master Kenobi . . .\\n\\nShe embraces Obi-Wan.\\n\\nPADME: (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you\\'re alive.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .\\n\\nPADME: I know, it\\'s hard to believe everything to which we\\'ve dedicated our lives is gone.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.\\n\\nPADME: The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No. Padme . . . It\\'s over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.\\n\\nPADME: The Sith!?!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'m here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?\\n\\nPADME: Yesterday.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: And do you know where he is now?\\n\\nPADME: (looks down) No.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Padme, I need your help.

How could you even say that?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.\\n\\nPADME: Not Anakin! He couldn\\'t!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we\\'ve been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.\\n\\nPADME: I don\\'t believe you ... I can\\'t.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Padme, I must find him.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'re going to kill him, aren\\'t you?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He has become a very great threat.\\n\\nAs PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy.\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin is the father, isn\\'t he?\\n\\nPADME looks away.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I\\'m so sorry.\\n\\nOBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her neck.\\n\\n188 INT.

CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET\\n\\nA small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO.\\n\\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: My Lady, let me come with you.\\n\\nPADME: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.\\n\\nTYPHO bows.\\n\\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.\\n\\nPADME: I\\'ll be all right, Captain.\\n\\nHe goes to the speeder and gets in.\\n\\nPADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.\\n\\nC-3PO: Oh, dear.\\n\\nTYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off.\\n\\n192 INT. NABOO SKIFF\\n\\nTHREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.\\n\\nC-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I\\'m beginning to get the hang of this flying business.\\n\\nOBI-WAN stows away on Padme\\'s ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.\\n\\n193 INT.

MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY\\n\\nA Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.\\n\\nDARTH VADER: Very good, My Lord.\\n\\nANAKIN sees Padme\\'s ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.\\n\\n195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin\\'s GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.\\n\\nANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . .\\n\\nThey embrace.\\n\\nPADME: Oh, Anakin!\\n\\nANAKIN: It\\'s all right, you\\'re safe now. What are you doing out here?\\n\\nPADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.\\n\\nANAKIN: What things?\\n\\nPADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.\\n\\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.\\n\\nPADME: He cares about us.\\n\\nANAKIN: Us??!\\n\\nPADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you.\\n\\nANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can\\'t ... he can\\'t help you. He\\'s not strong enough.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.\\n\\nANAKIN: Love won\\'t save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.\\n\\nPADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don\\'t do this.\\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t lose you the way I lost my mother! I\\'ve become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I\\'ve done it for you. To protect you.\\n\\nPADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.\\n\\nANAKIN: Don\\'t you see, we don\\'t have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.\\n\\nPADME: I don\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You\\'ve changed.\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don\\'t you turn against me.\\n\\nPADME: I don\\'t know you anymore. Anakin, you\\'re breaking my heart. I\\'ll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I \\ncan\\'t follow.\\n\\nANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan?\\n\\nPADME: Because of what you\\'ve done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.\\n\\nANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!\\n\\nPADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.\\n\\nPADME: No!\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re with him. You\\'ve betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!\\n\\nPADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...\\n\\nANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Let her go, Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: What have you and she been up to?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Let her go!\\n\\nANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.\\n\\nANAKIN: You turned her against me.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You have done that yourself.\\n\\nANAKIN: You will not take her from me.\\n\\nANAKIN throws off his cloak.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.\\n\\nOBI-WAN flings off his cloak.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.\\n\\nThey circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.\\n\\nANAKIN: Don\\'t lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your new Empire?\\n\\nANAKIN: Don\\'t make me kill you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.\\n\\nANAKIN: If you\\'re not with me, you\\'re my enemy.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.\\n\\n(ignites his lightsaber)\\n\\nANAKIN: You will try.\\n\\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force. \\nThey work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower level. \\nARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious PADME\\'s aid.\\n\\n196 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR\\'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT\\n\\nYODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS\\'s desk.\\n\\nYODA: I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Master Yoda, you survived.\\n\\nYODA: Surprised?\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.\\n\\nThe Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out, surrounding YODA. \\nYODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.\\n\\n197 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.\\n\\n198 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO CRUISER-DAY\\n\\nR2-D2, tries to drag PADME on board the Naboo Cruiser. C-3PO pokes his head out of the ship\\'s doorway.\\n\\nC-3PO: What are you doing? You\\'re going to hurt her. Wait!!\\n\\nC-3PO starts down the ramp.\\n\\n199 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR\\'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned YODA.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.\\n\\nYODA: Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.\\n\\nYODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.\\n\\nYODA: (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.\\n\\nYODA: (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??\\n\\nYODA ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nYODA: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nTheir swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.\\n\\n\\n200 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nView screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.\\n\\nANAKIN: Don\\'t make me destroy you, Master. You\\'re no match for the dark side.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'ve heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I\\'d hear it from you.\\n\\nANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same.\\n\\n201 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT\\n\\nPALPATINE seeks refuge in the vast Senate Chamber. He gets into the Chancellor\\'s Podium and it starts to rise up into the Arena. YODA makes a giant leap into the control pod. The sword fighting is intense in the confined space.\\n\\n202 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nThe battle intensifies.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.\\n\\nOBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.\\n\\nANAKIN: You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN. \\nBoth combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels. \\nThey regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN away. \\nThey battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony.\\n\\n203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT\\n\\nYODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord\\'s lightning bolts.\\n\\nThe energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed.\\n\\nYODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.\\n\\nYODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another.\\n\\nYODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment.\\n\\nYODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA.\\n\\n204 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as he pushes him further and further along the walkway.\\n\\nThe balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava.\\n\\nANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel. \\nALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.\\n\\n205 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY, PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER, MAIN COLLECTION PLANT-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN, following OBI-WAN, jumps down onto the flexing pipe, lands, and resumes fighting.\\n\\n206 INT. MUSTAFAR-PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN work their way across the small pipe, fighting ferociously as they go. OBI-WAN slips, throws his lightsaber up in the air, grabs on to the pipe, swings around, grabs on to an upper pipe, retrieves his lightsaber, and lands back on the original pipe. They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant.\\n\\n207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT\\n\\nYODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink.\\n\\nYODA: Hurry. Careful timing we will need.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: (in speeder) There aren\\'t many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you\\'re ready.\\n\\n208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT\\n\\nA Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda \\'s body.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER THIRE: There is no sign of his body, sir.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Then he is not dead.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Double your search.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER THIRE: Yes sir. Right away, sir.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Yes, Master.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.\\n\\nPALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods.\\n\\n209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It\\'s raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover. \\nSupport for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river.\\n\\nIt bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava.\\n\\n210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads away from the Senate Building.\\n\\n211 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA\\'S SPEEDER-NIGHT\\n\\nYODA straightens himself out.\\n\\nYODA: Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.\\n\\nYODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.\\n\\n212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows. \\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.\\n\\n213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\\n\\nC-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks on. BEEPING.\\n\\nC-3PO: I am being careful. I\\'ve got a good hold on her, but . . . I\\'m worried about my back. I hope it\\'s able to hold up under this weight.\\n\\nC-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.\\n\\n214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY\\n\\nFrom their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.\\n\\nSNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.\\n\\nOBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.\\n\\nANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.\\n\\nOBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin\\'s DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.\\n\\nANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.\\n\\nANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!\\n\\nANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.\\n\\nANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN\\'s platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: It\\'s over, Anakin. I have the high ground.\\n\\nANAKIN: You underestimate my power!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Don\\'t try it.\\n\\nANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.\\n\\nANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.\\n\\nOBI-WAN picks up Anakin\\'s light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.\\n\\nANAKIN: I hate you!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.\\n\\nANAKIN\\'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.\\n\\n215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can\\'t watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.\\n\\nHe runs back to Padme\\'s ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.\\n\\n216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.\\n\\nC-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.\\n\\nOBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.\\n\\n217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\\n\\nPADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.\\n\\nPADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?\\n\\nOBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her. \\nOBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot\\'s station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.\\n\\n218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands.\\n\\n219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE-DAY\\n\\nAn Imperial Shuttle closes its wings and settles on the highest of the Mustafar Landing Platforms. A PLATOON OF CLONE TROOPERS exits the craft, followed by DARTH SIDIOUS.\\n\\n220 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS walks in front of the CLONE TROOPERS on his way to get to Anakin at the edge of the lava pit.\\n\\n221 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He\\'s still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.\\n\\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Yes sir. Right away.\\n\\nSeveral of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN\\'s forehead.\\n\\n222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT\\n\\nOn the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.\\n\\nYODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...\\n\\nQUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.\\n\\nYODA: Eternal consciousness.\\n\\nQUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.\\n\\nYODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.\\n\\nQUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.\\n\\nYODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.\\n\\nYODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.\\n\\n223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER. DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes off.\\n\\n224 EXT. POLIS MASSA-LANDING PLATFORM-NIGHT\\n\\nOBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBI-WAN emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We\\'ll take her to the medical center, quickly.\\n\\n225 EXT. LANDING PLATFORM-CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\\n\\nThe shuttle lands. DARTH SIDIOUS and CLONE TROOPERS leave the shuttle. ANAKIN\\'s body is carried along in a floating medical capsule.\\n\\n226 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\\n\\nPOLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can\\'t explain, we are losing her.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: She\\'s dying?\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: We don\\'t know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Babies??!!\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: She\\'s carrying twins.\\n\\nYODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope.\\n\\nThe MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.\\n\\nC-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.\\n\\n227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.\\n\\n228 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\\n\\nThe TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Don\\'t give up, Padme.\\n\\nPADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: It\\'s a boy.\\n\\nPADME: Luke . . .\\n\\nPADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl.\\n\\nPADME: . . . Leia.\\n\\nR2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.\\n\\n229 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\\n\\nVADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly.

POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\\n\\nOBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t . . .\\n\\nPADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN\\'s hand. She is holding Anakin\\'s japor snippet.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Save your energy.\\n\\nPADME: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .\\n\\nA last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.\\n\\n231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.\\n\\nThe DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?\\n\\nDARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.\\n\\nDARTH VADER: Yes, My Master.\\n\\nDARTH VADER looks around the room.\\n\\nDARTH VADER: (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: I\\'m afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.\\n\\nA LOW GROAN emanates from Vader\\'s mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.\\n\\nDARTH VADER: I couldn\\'t have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It\\'s impossible! No!!!\\n\\nVADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren\\'t so lucky. VADER\\'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.\\n\\n232 EXT.

We\\'ve always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: And what of the boy?\\n\\nYODA: To Tatooine. To his family, send him.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin\\'s twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?\\n\\nYODA: Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.\\n\\nBAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.\\n\\nYODA: (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Training??\\n\\nYODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Who?\\n\\nYODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?\\n\\nYODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?\\n\\nYODA: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force.

There\\'s still 30 pallets of cannon shells in C bunker.\\n\\nKAYDEL KO CONNIX: Forget the ammunition, there\\'s no time. Just get everyone on the transport.

This is where we snuff-out the resistance once and for all. Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought. Incinerate their base, destroy their transports and obliterate their fleet.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - DAY\\n\\nThe enormous Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought known as the Fulminatrix, owned by CAPTAIN MODEN CANADY, pops from hyperspace and into the foreground from the far reaches of space. Two massive cannons slung beneath the ship\\'s belly begin to lower and take aim.\\n\\nINT. STAR DESTROYER FINALIZER - BRIDGE PIT\\n\\nIn the destroyer\\'s bridge pit, a beautiful yet stern monitor eyes a red X shape on her radar screen, her surroundings lit red for ideal visibility during battlefield conditions.\\n\\nMONITOR: General, Resistance ship approaching. Launching shields in attack mode.\\n\\nARMITAGE HUX: (incredulous) A single light fighter?\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - DAY\\n\\nThe X-wing ship faces off with the Fulminatrix. The tiny droid BB-8 occupies the tailseat with COMMANDER POE DAMERON up front.\\n\\nINT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT\\n\\nPOE: Happy beeps here, buddy, come on. \\n\\nINT.

X-WING SHIP - HOLD\\n\\nBB-8 drops down to a socket to a cable-filled hold. His head hovers from his body as he searches the craft compartment. Appendages on his telescoping arm plug damaged panel sections, but more begin to spark as BB-8 chirps nervously.\\n\\nINT. STAR DESTROYER FULMINATRIX - BRIDGE PIT\\n\\nCanady paces aboard the Fulminatrix.\\n\\nCANADY: Are the auto cannons primed?\\n\\nGONERIL: Primed and ready, sir.\\n\\nCANADY: What are we waiting for?

SPACE - DAY\\n\\nTailing Poe\\'s X-wing ship through an antenna on the Fulminatrix\\'s hull, one of the TIE fighters crashes and burns.\\n\\nINT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT\\n\\nPOE: These things are fleet killers. We can\\'t let it get away.\\n\\nLEIA: (over intercom) Disengage now... Commander, that is an order...\\n\\nPoe flips a switch on his cockpit\\'s console and continues on.\\n\\nINT. RADDUS - CONTROL ROOM\\n\\nC-3PO the golden droid from Tatooine stands next to Leia\\n\\nLEIA: Wipe that nervous expression off your face, 3PO.\\n\\nC-3PO: Oh. Well, I\\'ll certainly try, General. Nervous?\\n\\nINT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT\\n\\nA target lines up in Poe\\'s cockpit\\'s viewfinder.\\n\\nPOE: Let\\'s go, BB-8... It\\'s now or never!\\n\\nEXT. X-WING SHIP - HOLD\\n\\nBB-8 chirps as with inventiveness born of desperation, he has lowered the elevator he used to assume his station in the droid socket halfway, which requires that he erases three improper-operation alerts from the X-wing ship, and rolls into the cavity of the fuselage, as close to the short in the junction box as possible. His arm retracts into his body. Then, he uses the welding arm to swing the head out and down, like a man doffing his hat, shrieking. It smashes into the sparking junction box, primary photoreceptor swirling with electronic feedback.\\n\\nINT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT\\n\\nPoe squeezes his weapon\\'s trigger, destroying the last cannon on the Fulminatrix\\'s hull.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - DAY\\n\\nThe X-wing zooms to the fiery cloud, then banks around. Two pursuing TIE fighters collide and explode, then BB-8 pops up, crackling with energy and exclaiming softly.\\n\\nINT.

Resistance bombers approaching.\\n\\nCANADY: Of course they are.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - DAY\\n\\nA squad of heavy bombers and A-wing ships known as Colbrat Squadron and Blue Squadron approaches the dreadnought, resembling World War II aeroplanes, with long virtual compartments extending from their fuselages like magazines from automatic rifles. LIEUTENANT TALLISSAN LINTRA the beautiful young blonde pilot hovers on board her blue A-wing ship.\\n\\nINT. A-WING SHIP - COCKPIT\\n\\nTALLIE: Bombers, keep that tight formation. Fighters, protect the bombers. It\\'s not every day we get a shot at a dreadnought, so make this count.\\n\\nINT. COLBRAT HAMMER - COCKPIT\\n\\nFINCH DALLOW: Copy that, Blue Leader.\\n\\nINT.

Tallie, they have targeted the fleet and begun the priming sequence.\\nTALLIE: Copy that. We are almost there. Bombardiers.... begin your drop sequence.\\nNIX JERD: I\\'ve got a visual on the target. We are approaching the point of attack. The bombs are armed.\\nBASCUS: Auto cannons aimed.\\nGONERIL: 40 seconds to full charge.\\nCANADY: Destroy that last bomber!\\nPOE: Paige, come in. We\\'re over the target. Why aren\\'t your bay doors open? You\\'re the only bomber left. It\\'s all down to you!\\nPAIGE: Nix!\\nPOE: Paige!

I\\'ll take it in my chambers.\\nSNOKE: General Hux.\\nARMITAGE HUX: Ah, good. Supreme leade-\\nSNOKE: My disappointment... in your performance can not be overstated.\\nARMITAGE HUX: They can\\'t get away, Supreme Leader. We have them tied on the end of a string.\\n\\nFINN: Rey!\\nPOE: Well done, pal. \"Finn naked leaking bag\"? What? Did you fry a chip? Finn! Hey, buddy. It\\'s so good to see you. What? Let\\'s uh... We need to get you dressed. Come on. You must have a thousand questions.\\nFINN: Where is Rey?\\n\\nREY: Master Skywalker? Master Skywalker? I\\'m from the Resistance. Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help. Hello?\\nLUKE: Go away. Chewie, what are you doing here?\\nREY: He said you\\'re coming back with us.\\nLUKE: How did you find me?\\nREY: Long story we\\'ll tell you in the Falcon.\\nLUKE: Falcon? Wait. Where is Han?\\n\\nSNOKE: Tied to a string, indeed, General Hux. Well done. The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.\\nARMITAGE HUX: Thank you, Supreme Leader.\\nSNOKE: Do you wonder why I keep a rabid cur... In a such a place of power? The cur\\'s weakness, properly manipulated... Can be a sharp tool. How\\'s your wound?\\nKYLO REN: It\\'s nothing.\\nSNOKE: The mighty Kylo Ren. When I found you... I saw what all masters live to see. Raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special. The potential of your bloodline. A new Vader. Now I fear... I was mistaken.\\nKYLO REN: Ive given everything I have to you To the dark side.\\nSNOKE: Take that ridiculous thing off. Yes, there it is. You have too much of your father\\'s heart in you, young Solo.\\nKYLO REN: I killed Han Solo. When the moment came I didn\\'t hesitate.\\nSNOKE: And look at you, the deed split your spirit to the bone. You were unbalanced... Bested by a girl who had never held a lightsaber! You failed! Skywalker lives. The seed of the Jedi Order lives. As long as it does... Hope lives in the galaxy. I thought you would be the one to snuff it out. Alas, you\\'re no Vader. You\\'re just a child... in a mask.\\nKYLO REN: Prepare my ship.\\n\\nREY: There is no light left in Kylo Ren. He\\'s only getting stronger. The First Order will control all the major systems within weeks. We need your help. We need the Jedi Order back. We need Luke Skywalker.\\nLUKE: You don\\'t need Luke Skywalker.\\nREY: Did you hear a word I just said?\\nLUKE: You think what? I\\'m gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order? What did you think was going to happen here? Do you think that I came... To the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all? Go away.\\nREY: I\\'m not leaving without you! Careful!\\nLUKE: You are wasting your time. \\nWho are you?\\nREY: I know this place.\\nLUKE: Built a thousand generations ago... to keep these. The original Jedi texts. Just like me, they\\'re the last of the Jedi religion. You\\'ve seen this place. You\\'ve seen this island.\\nREY: Only in dreams.\\nLUKE: Who are you?\\nREY: The Resistance sent me.\\nLUKE: They sent you? What is special about you? Where are you from?\\nREY: Nowhere.\\nLUKE: No one\\'s from nowhere.\\nREY: Jakku.\\nLUKE: All right, that is pretty much nowhere. Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?\\nREY: The Resistance sent me. We need your help. The First Order has become unstoppable.\\nLUKE: Why are you here?\\nREY: Something inside me has always been there Then now it\\'s awake. And I\\'m afraid. I do not know what it is... or what to do with it. And I need help.\\nLUKE: You need a teacher. I can\\'t teach you.\\nREY: Why not? I\\'ve seen your daily routine. You\\'re not busy.\\nLUKE: I will never train another generation of Jedi. I came to this island to die. It\\'s time for the Jedi to end.\\nREY: Why? Leia sent me here with hope. If she was wrong, she deserves to know why. We all do.\\n\\nLEIA: You\\'re demoted.\\nPOE: What? Wait! We took down a dreadnought.\\nLEIA: At what cost?\\nPOE: If you start an attack, you follow through.\\nLEIA: Poe, get your head out of your cockpit. There are things you can not solve... By jumping into an X-wing and blowing something up! I need you to learn that.\\nPOE: There were heroes on that mission.\\nLEIA: Dead heroes, No leaders.\\nFINN: We\\'re really nowhere. How\\'s Rey going to find us now? A cloaked binary beacon?\\nLEIA: To light her way home.\\nFINN: Alright, Well, until she comes back, what\\'s the plan?\\nLEIA: We need to find a new base.\\nLARMA D\\'ACY: One with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies. scattered in the Outer Rim.\\nACKBAR: Proximity alert!\\nRESISTANCE FEMALE SOLDIER: They found us.\\nPOE: That\\'s impossible. It\\'s Snoke\\'s ship. You\\'ve gotta be kidding me. Can we jump to lightspeed?\\nKAYDEL KO CONNIX: We have enough fuel for just one jump.\\nPOE: Do it. We have to get out of here.\\nLEIA: Wait. They tracked us through lightspeed.\\nFINN: That\\'s impossible.\\nLEIA: Yes. And they\\'ve done it.\\nFINN: So if we jump to lightspeed... they\\'ll just find us again, and we\\'ll be out of fuel. They\\'ve got us.\\nPOE: Not yet, they don\\'t. Permission to jump in an X-wing and blow something up?\\nLEIA: Permission granted. Admiral, spin us around!\\nACKBAR: Reverse. Rotate the shields!\\nRESISTANCE MONITOR: To your stations! Move, move, move!\\n\\nKYLO REN: Follow my lead.\\n\\nMALE ANNOUNCER: Green squadron to launch position. Clear the launch traffic.\\nPOE: Don\\'t wait for me! Jump in and fire her up!\\nMALE ANNOUNCER: Technicians, secure supplies for launch conditions.\\nPILOT: Move! Move!\\nFINN: Poe, are you alright?\\nPOE: We need to get outta range of those Star Destroyers.\\nACKBAR: We need to what?\\nLEIA: Full engines ahead. Get out of range of the Star Destroyers and the fighters will fall back.\\nACKBAR: All craft, full engines! Concentrate rear shields.\\nARMITAGE HUX: Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of reach. We can\\'t cover you at this distance. Return to the fleet. What is the point of all this if we can\\'t blow up three tiny cruisers?\\nPEAVEY: They are faster and lighter, sir. They can\\'t lose us but they can keep at a range where our cannons are not effective against their shields.\\nARMITAGE HUX: Well, keep up the barrage. Let\\'s at least remind them that we\\'re still here.\\nPEAVEY: Very good sir.\\nARMITAGE HUX: They won\\'t last long burning fuel like this. It\\'s just a matter of time.\\nPOE: Move! Outta the way, everybody! Make way! Make room!\\nMEDIC DROID: Her vital signs are weak, but she is fighting.\\n\\nLUKE: Artoo? Artoo! Yes. Yes I know. Hey, it\\'s a sacred island, watch the language. Old friend. I wish I could make you understand. But I\\'m not coming back. Nothing can make me change my mind.\\nLEIA IN HOLOGRAM: Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. It hurts me not to be able to fulfill my father\\'s request in person...\\nLUKE: That was a cheap move.\\nLEIA IN HOLOGRAM: But they are attacking my ship... and I fear that my mission to bring you to Alderaan failed. It is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You\\'re my only hope.\\nLUKE: Tomorrow at dawn. Three lessons. I will teach you the ways of the Jedi... and why they need to end.\\n\\nLARMA D\\'ACY: General Organa... Leia... is unconscious but recovering. This is the only good news I have. Admiral Ackbar... all our leadership, they\\'re gone.\\nC-3PO: Oh, dear, oh, dear.\\nLARMA D\\'ACY: Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge. If she were here, she\\'d say save your sorrow for after the fight. And to that end... The chain of command is clear as to who should take her place. Vice Admiral Holdo... of the cruiser Ninka.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: Thank you, Commander. There are four hundred of us... on three ships. We\\'re the very last of the Resistance But we\\'re not alone. In every corner of the galaxy... the downtrodden and oppressed know our symbol... and they put their hope in it. We are the spark that will ignite the fire that will restore the Republic. That spark... this Resistance, must survive. That is our mission. Now, to your stations. And may the Force be with us.\\nPOE: That\\'s Admiral Holdo? Battle of Chyron Belt, Admiral Holdo? Not what I expected. Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron. With our current fuel consumption... there is a very limited amount time... That we will stay out of range of those Star Destroyers.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: Very kind to make me aware.\\nPOE: Let\\'s get me those fuel projections. And we need to shake them before we find a new base, so... What\\'s our plan?\\nAMILYN HOLDO: Our plan, captain? Not commander, right? Wasn\\'t it Leia\\'s last official act to demote you? Because of your dreadnought plan... Where we lost our entire bombing fleet?\\nPOE: \"Captain.\" \"Commander.\" You can call me whatever you like. I just want to know what\\'s going on.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: Of course you do. I understand. I\\'ve dealt with plenty of trigger happy flyboys like you... You are impulsive. Dangerous. And the last thing we need right now. So stick to your post... and follow my orders.\\nFEMALE P.A. ANNOUNCER: Turbo-lifts seven and eight disconnected for maintenance.\\n\\nROSE: What are you doing here?\\nFINN: Hey, hi. Uh, I was... Uh, you know...\\nROSE: You are Finn! The Finn!\\nFINN: The Finn?\\nROSE: Sorry... I work behind pipes all day. Doing talking with the Resistance heroes is not my forte. Doing... Doing talking, yeah... I\\'m Rose. \\nFINN: Breathe.\\nROSE: OK.\\nFINN: Yeah, look I\\'m not a Resistance hero, but... It was nice talking to you, Rose. May the Force be with you.\\nROSE: Wow. You too. Good. But you are a hero. You left the First Order-what you did on the Starkiller Base. When we heard about it, my sister Paige said... \"Rose, that\\'s a real hero.\" \"Know right from wrong.... \"and don\\'t run away from when it gets hard,\" she said. You know... Just this morning, I had to stun... three people who were trying to jump ship. In this escape pod.\\nFINN: What?\\nROSE: They were running away.\\nFINN: That\\'s disgraceful.\\nROSE: I know.\\nFINN: Anyway, uh... I gotta get back to what I was doing, so.\\nROSE: What were you doing?\\nFINN: Just, just, uh checks.\\nROSE: Checking the escape pods.\\nFINN: No, it\\'s routine checks.\\nROSE: While boarding one... with a packed bag.\\nFINN: Okay. Listen, I... I can\\'t move. I can\\'t move.\\nROSE: I know.\\nFINN: What happened?\\nROSE: I\\'m taking you to the bridge and turning you in for desertion.\\nFINN: I was not deserting. - I told you that...\\nROSE: My sister just died... protecting the fleet. And you were running away.\\nFINN: I\\'m sorry. This fleet is doomed... If my friend comes back to it, she\\'s doomed too. I\\'ve gotta get this... I\\'ve gotta get this beacon very far away from here, then she\\'ll find me and be safe.\\nROSE: You\\'re a selfish traitor.\\nFINN: Look, we cannot outrun the First Order fleets.\\nROSE: We can jump to light speed!\\nFINN: Well they can track us through lightspeed.\\nROSE: They can track us through lightspeed?\\nFINN: Yeah. They\\'ll just show up 30 seconds later and we\\'ll have blown a ton of fuel. Of which, by the way, we\\'re dangerously short on.\\nROSE: They can track us through lightspeed.\\nFINN: Yes. And they could... I can\\'t feel my teeth. What did you shoot me with?\\nROSE: Active tracking.\\nFINN: What now?\\nROSE: New hyperspace tracking... Hyperspace tracking is a new tactic but the principal must be the same as any active tracker.\\nFINN: So they\\'re just tracking us...\\nROSE: Only tracking us...\\nFINN AND ROSE: From the lead ship.\\nROSE: But we can\\'t get to the tracker. It is an A-class process they\\'ll control from the main bridge.\\nFINN: Well, I mean, yes, but every A-class process...\\nFINN AND ROSE: Has a dedicated power breaker.\\nROSE: But... Wait, but who knows where the breaker room is on the Star Destroyer?\\nFINN: I\\'m the guy who used to mop it. If I can get us there....\\nROSE: I can shut their tracker down.\\n\\nPOE: Just give it to me one more time, but simpler.\\nFINN: So the First Order\\'s only tracking us from one Destroyer, the main one.\\nPOE: So we make blow that one up?\\nFINN: I like where you\\'re heading, but no. They\\'d only start tracking us from another Destroyer.\\nROSE: But if we can....\\nFINN: If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer and disable the tracker without them realizing, then we can...\\nROSE: They won\\'t realize if it\\'s for one system cycle. About six minutes.\\nFINN: Sneak on board. Disable the tracker Our fleet escapes before they even realize.\\nPOE: How did you two meet?\\nROSE: Just luck.\\nPOE: Yeah? Good luck?\\nROSE: Not sure yet.\\nFINN: Poe, we\\'ve got to do this It will save the fleet and it\\'ll save Rey.\\nC-3PO: If I surely must be the voice of reason... Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan.\\nPOE: Yeah, you\\'re right, 3PO. It\\'s a need-to-know plan, and she doesn\\'t.\\nC-3PO: That was not exactly...\\nPOE: All right... You guys shut down that tracker. I\\'ll be here to jump us to lightspeed. The question is... How do we sneak the two of you onto Snoke\\'s destroyer?\\nROSE: We steal clearance codes.\\nFINN: No, they are Bio-Hexaencripted and rescrambled every hour. We can\\'t get through their security shields undetected. Nobody can.\\n\\nMAZ: Could I do it? Of course I could do it. But I can\\'t do it, I\\'m a little tied down right now.\\nFINN: Maz? What is happening?\\nMAZ: A union dispute, you do NOT want to hear about it. But, lucky for you... There\\'s exactly one guy I trust that can crush that kind of security! He is a master codebreaker, an ace pilot... a poet with a blaster.\\nC-3PO: Oh my. It seems that this codebreaker can practically do everything.\\nMAZ: Oh yes, he can. You will find him with a red ploom flower on his lapel... rolling on a high stakes table... in the casino... on Canto Bight.\\nPOE: Canto Bight? - No, no. That\\'s... Maz... Is there any way we can take care of this ourselves?\\nMAZ: I\\'m sorry, kiddo. This is rarified cracking. If you want to get on that Destroyer, I know only one option. Find the master codebreaker.\\n\\nKYLO REN: You\\'ll bring Luke Skywalker to me. You\\'re not doing this. The effort would kill you. Can you see my surroundings?\\nREY: You are going to pay for what you did!\\nKYLO REN: I can\\'t see yours. Just you. So no. This is something else. Luke.\\nLUKE: What\\'s that about?\\nREY: I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.\\nLUKE: Let\\'s get started.\\nREY: Who were those things?\\nLUKE: Caretakers. Island natives. They\\'ve kept up the Jedi structures since they\\'ve been built.\\nREY: I don\\'t think they like me.\\nLUKE: I can\\'t imagine why.\\nREY: Master Skywalker, we need you to bring the Jedi back because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force. Without the Jedi, we won\\'t stand a chance against him.\\nLUKE: What do you know about the Force?\\nREY: It\\'s a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and make things float.\\nLUKE: Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong. Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed. The Force is not a power you have. It\\'s not about lifting rocks. It\\'s the energy between all things, a tension, a balance, that binds the universe together.\\nREY: OK. But what is it?\\nLUKE: Close your eyes. Breathe. Now, reach out.\\nREY: I feel something.\\nLUKE: You feel it?\\nREY: Yes, I feel it.\\nLUKE: It\\'s the Force.\\nREY: Really?\\nLUKE: Wow, it must be really strong with you.\\nREY: I\\'ve never felt anythi----OW! You meant reach out like.... I\\'ll try again.\\nLUKE: Breathe. Just breathe. Reach out with your feelings. What do you see?\\nREY: The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.\\nLUKE: And between it all?\\nREY: Balance. And energy. A Force.\\nLUKE: And inside you?\\nREY: Inside me the same Force.\\nLUKE: And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity. Can you feel that?\\nREY: There\\'s something else beneath the island. A place. A dark place.\\nLUKE: Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness.\\nREY: It\\'s cold. It\\'s calling me.\\nLUKE: Resist it, Rey. Rey? Rey! You went straight to the dark.\\nREY: That place was trying to show me something.\\nLUKE: It offered you something you needed. And you didn\\'t even try to stop yourself.\\nREY: But I didn\\'t see you. Nothing from you. You\\'ve closed yourself off from the Force. Of course you have.\\nLUKE: I\\'ve seen this raw strength only once before, in Ben Solo. It didn\\'t scare me enough then. It does now.\\n\\nAMILYN HOLDO: What was that?\\nKAYDEL KO CONNIX: Nothing, Admiral. Passing debris.\\nFINN: The fleet\\'s only got 18 hours of fuel left. We gotta hurry.\\n\\nREY: Still can\\'t reach the Resistance? Keep at it. If you get through, check their status. And ask about Finn.\\nKYLO REN: Why is the Force connecting us? You and I.\\nREY: Murderous snake. You\\'re too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.\\nKYLO REN: Did he tell you what happened? The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why?\\nREY: I know everything I need to know about you.\\nKYLO REN: You do? Ah, you do. You have that look in your eyes. From the forest. When you called me a monster.\\nREY: You are a monster.\\nKYLO REN: Yes, I am.\\n\\nROSE: OK. We get in, we find this codebreaker, we get out.\\nFINN: Do you know this town? Canto Bight?\\nROSE: From stories. It\\'s a terrible place filled with the worst people in the galaxy.\\nFINN: Great.\\nSLOWEN LO: I told those two, I said, \"This is a public beach. You can\\'t park that shuttle.\" But they just lit off toward the casino.\\nTHAMM: Place your bets. Place your bets. All the bets on the table right now, right now! Place your bets here.\\nFINN: Aw, yes! This place is great!\\nROSE: OK. Maz says that this Master Codebreaker would have a red plom bloom on his lapel. Let\\'s find him and get out of here.\\nTHAMM: Well played. The house wins. Where are your manners, more like?\\nROSE: Come on!\\nFINN: We\\'ve covered this whole casino. Zero red plom blooms. Where is this guy?\\nROSE: Were those what I think they are?\\nFINN: What are those things?\\nROSE: Fathiers. I\\'ve never seen a real one.\\nFINN: Look, this whole place is beautiful. I mean, come on. Why do you hate it so much?\\nROSE: Look closer. My sister and I grew up in a poor mining system. The First Order stripped our ore to finance its military.... then shelled us to test their weapons. They took everything we had. And who do you think these people are? There\\'s only one business in the galaxy that\\'ll get you this rich.\\nFINN: War.\\nROSE: Selling weapons to the First Order. I wish I could put my fist through this whole lousy, beautiful town. Red plom bloom!\\nFINN: Red plom bloom!\\nROSE: The Master Codebreaker!\\nSLOWEN LO: Yup, those are the shuttle parkers.\\nCOP: All right, You two are under arrest for parking violation 27B/6. You have the right to remain....\\nLOVEY: What was that?\\nMASTER CODEBREAKER: No, no, no. Not now, Lovey. I\\'m on a roll.\\n\\nLUKE: Lesson Two. Now that they\\'re extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, defied. But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy, hubris.\\nREY: That\\'s not true.\\nLUKE: At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the Empire, and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.\\nREY: And a Jedi who saved him. Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy. But you saw that there was conflict inside him. You believed that he wasn\\'t gone. That he could be turned.\\nLUKE: And I became a legend. For many years, there was balance.... and then I saw Ben. My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood. And in my hubris, I thought I could train him, I could pass on my strengths. Han was Han about it, but Leia trusted me with her son. I took him, and a dozen students, and began a training temple. By the time I realized I was no match for the darkness rising in him, it was too late.\\nREY: What happened?\\nLUKE: I went to confront him. And he turned on me. Ben, no! He must have thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke, but it was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi master. A legend.\\nREY: The galaxy may need a legend. I need someone to show me my place in all this. And you didn\\'t fail Kylo. Kylo failed you. I won\\'t.\\n\\nPEAVEY: The main cruiser\\'s still keeping beyond range. But their medical frigate is out of fuel and its shields are down.\\nARMITAGE HUX: The beginning of their end. Destroy it.\\n\\nMEDICAL FRIGATE PILOT: The last of our crew has been evacuated and heading your way. It\\'s been an honor, Admiral. Godspeed, Rebels!\\nKAYDEL KO CONNIX: Admiral, fuel reserves at six hours.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: Maintain our current course. Steady on.\\n\\nPOE: Finn, Rose, where are you guys?\\nCOP: Deal me in. Thanks.\\nROSE: Finn, the fleet is running on fumes. Without a codebreaker to break us onto Snoke\\'s Star Destroyer.... what do we do?\\nFINN: I don\\'t know. Unless you got a thief in your pocket, our plan is shot.\\nDJ: Um, I can do it.\\nROSE: What?\\nFINN: What?\\nROSE: What?\\nDJ: S-S-S-Sorry, I\\'m just couldn\\'t help but overhear all the stuff that you were saying really loudly while I trying to sleep. Codebreaker? Thief? I can do it.\\nFINN: I\\'m not talking about picking pockets, OK?\\nDJ: Yeah. D-D-D-Don\\'t let the wrapper fool you, friend. Me and the First Order codeage go way back. And, if the price is right, I could break you into old man S-S-S-Snoke\\'s boudoir.\\nFINN: No.\\nROSE: We\\'re.... We\\'ve got it covered.\\nDJ: Ha-tuk-ga.\\nFINN: Did he just....?\\nROSE: Yeah. We gotta get outta here! This way!\\nCOP: Why, you little....\\nDJ: D-D-D-Did you do this?\\nCOP: Hey, hands up! Hands up!\\nDJ: Yeah, man. What\\'s your story, roundie?\\nCOP #1: They went this way! Lock down all the exits.\\nCOP #2: Wait.\\nFINN: That smells great. Those cops will be here any minute. What now? Whoa! Ooh!\\nROSE: No, wait. Please stop! We\\'re with the Resistance.\\nCOP #1: Roger that. Checking the stables now.\\nCOP #2: This way.\\nCOP #3: They must have come through here.\\nROSE: Hyah!\\nTEMIRI BLAGG - Go, go, go! Whoo!\\nFINN: Stop enjoying this, stop enjoying this!\\nSPEEDER PILOT: We\\'ve got them. They aren\\'t going anywhere.\\nFINN AND ROSE: Ahhhh!\\nFINN: Huh?\\nROSE: Move, move, move! Get outta the way!\\nFINN: Our ship\\'s on the beach straight ahead! We need cover! Too much cover! There it is!\\nFINN AND ROSE: No!\\nFINN: Come on!\\nSPEEDER PILOT: Let the flock go. Stick with the perps. Where\\'d they go?\\nFINN: I think we lost them! Now we go down to the beach and circle back around....\\nROSE: Cliff! We\\'re trapped.\\nFINN: It was worth it, though. To tear up that town, make \\'em hurt.\\nROSE: Go. Now, it\\'s worth it.\\nSPEEDER PILOT: There they are.\\nFINN: BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?\\nDJ: N-N-N-Need a lift?\\n\\nLEIA: Luke.\\nLUKE: Leia.\\nREY: I\\'d rather not do this now.\\nKYLO REN: Yeah, me too.\\nREY: Why did you hate your father? Do you have something, a cowl or something you can put on? Why did you hate your father? Give me an honest answer. You had a father who loved you, he gave a damn about you.\\nKYLO REN: I didn\\'t hate him.\\nREY: Then why?\\nKYLO REN: Why, what? Why, what? Say it.\\nREY: Why did you... Why did you kill him? I don\\'t understand.\\nKYLO REN: No? Your parents threw you away like garbage.\\nREY: They didn\\'t!\\nKYLO REN: They did. But you can\\'t stop needing them. It\\'s your greatest weakness. Looking for them everywhere.... in Han Solo.... now in Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened that night?\\nREY: Yes.\\nKYLO REN: No. He had sensed my power, as he senses yours. And he feared it.\\nREY: Liar.\\nKYLO REN: Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. That\\'s the only way to become what you were meant to be.\\nREY: No! No!\\nFEMALE VOICE: Rey?\\nREY: I should have felt trapped or panicked. But I didn\\'t. This didn\\'t go on forever, I knew it was leading somewhere. And that, at the end, it would show me what I came to see.\\nFEMALE VOICE: Rey.\\nREY: Let me see them. My parents... please. I thought I\\'d find answers here. I was wrong. I\\'ve never felt so alone KYLO REN: You\\'re not alone. \\nREY: Neither are you. \\nLUKE: Rey? \\nREY: It isn\\'t too late.\\nLUKE: Stop! \\nREY: It is true? Did you try to murder him? \\nLUKE: Leave this island now! \\nREY: Stop. Stop! Did you do it? Did you create Kylo Ren? Tell me the truth. \\nLUKE: I saw darkness. I\\'d sensed it building in him. I\\'d see it at moments during his training. But then I looked inside... and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction, and pain, and death... and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct... I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame... and with consequence. And the last thing I saw... were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him. Ben, no! \\nREY: You failed him by thinking his choice was made It wasn\\'t There is still conflict in him If he turned from the dark side, that could shift the tide. This could be how we win. \\nLUKE: This is not going to go the way you think. \\nREY: It is. Just now, when we touched hands... I saw his future. As solid as I\\'m seeing you. If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.\\nLUKE: Rey... don\\'t do this.\\nREY: Then he is our last hope.\\n\\nLUKE: Master Yoda.\\nYODA: Young Skywalker.\\nLUKE: I\\'m ending all of this. The tree, the text, the Jedi. I\\'m going to burn it down.\\nYODA: Hmm. (laughs) Ah, Skywalker, missed you, have I.\\nLUKE: So it is time for the Jedi Order to end.\\nYODA: Time it is. For you to look at a pile of old books, hmmm?\\nLUKE: The sacred Jedi texts.\\nYODA: Oh. Read them, have you?\\nLUKE: Well, I...\\nYODA: Page-turners they were not. Yes, yes, yes. Wisdom they held, but that library contained nothing that the girl Rey does not already possess. Skywalker, still looking to the horizon. Never here, now, hmmm? (pokes Luke with his walking stick) The need in front of your nose. Hmmm?\\nLUKE: I was weak. Unwise.\\nYODA: Lost Ben Solo, you did. Lose Rey, we must not.\\nLUKE: I can\\'t be what she needs me to be.\\nYODA: Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, falure, also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.\\n\\nFINN: Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks. \\nROSE: I just hope we\\'re in time. You can actually do this, right? \\nDJ: Yeah, about that... Guys, I can do it. But there exists a pre-\"do it\" conversation about price. \\nROSE: Once we\\'re done, the Resistance will give you whatever you want. \\nDJ: What you got deposit-wise? \\nFINN: Are you kidding me? Look at us.\\nDJ: Is that Haysian smelt? That\\'s something. \\nFINN: No, we gave you our word. You\\'re gonna get paid. That should be enough. \\nDJ: Guys, I wanna keep helping. But no something, n-n-n-no doing. \\nFINN: OK, listen here, you\\'ve gotta.... \\nROSE: Do it. \\nDJ: Now I can help. \\nFINN: Give it back. \\nDJ: What? \\nFINN: Give it back! You have no idea how much that medallion means to her. What are you.... Why are you ransacking your own ship? It\\'s not your ship. \\nDJ: He says I stole it. \\nFINN: Yeah, I got that. \\nDJ: We stole it. \\nFINN: At least you\\'re stealing from the bad guys and helping the good. \\nDJ: Good guys, bad guys, made-up words. Let\\'s see who formally owned this gorgeous hunk-uh. Ah, this guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh.... and the good. Finn, let me learn you something big. It\\'s all a machine, partner. Live free, don\\'t join. \\n\\nPEAVEY: That was the last of their support ships. It\\'s just their main cruiser now. \\nARMITAGE HUX: And their fuel reserve? \\nPEAVEY: By our calculations.... critical. \\n\\nPOE: She in there?\\nLARMA D\\'ACY: The Admiral\\'s banned you from the bridge. Let\\'s not have a scene. \\nPOE: No, let\\'s. Holdo? \\nLARMA: You\\'re not allowed in here. \\nHOLDO: Flyboy. \\nPOE: Cut it, lady. We had a fleet, now we\\'re down to one ship, and you\\'ve told us nothing! Tell us that we have a plan! That there\\'s hope! \\nHOLDO: When I served under Leia, she would say, hope is like the sun. If you only believe in it when you can see it.... \\nPOE: You\\'ll never make it through the night. \\nHOLDO: Yes. \\nPOE: Are you fueling up the transports? You are. All of them? We\\'re abandoning ship? Is that.... That\\'s what you got? That\\'s what you brought us to? Coward! Those transports ships are unarmed, unshielded. We abandon this cruiser, we\\'re done. We don\\'t stand a chance. No, you are not just a coward, you are a traitor. \\nHOLDO: Get this man off my bridge. \\n\\nPOE: Finn, Holdo\\'s loading the crew in the shuttles. She\\'s going to abandon ship. Where are you? \\nFINN: Poe, we\\'re on our way back to the fleet. We\\'re so close. \\nPOE: Did you find the Master Codebreaker? \\nFINN: We found a codebreaker. We can shut the tracker down. Just buy us a little more time. \\nPOE: All right, hurry. \\n\\nREY: As soon as I launch, you jump back out of range. Stay there until you get my signal for where to rendezvous. If you see Finn before I do, tell him... Yeah, perfect. Tell him that. \\n\\nDJ: Cloaking our approach. We should be off their scopes. Then we slice a slit in their shield. Blip bloppity bloop, and slip right through. \\n\\nAMILYN HOLDO: So a stormtrooper, and a who now are doing what? \\nPOE: They are trying to save us. This is our best chance for escape. You have to give Finn and Rose all the time that you can. \\nAMILYN HOLDO: You have bet the survival of the Resistance on bad odds and put us all at risk? There\\'s no time now. We have to get clear of the cruiser. Load the transports.\\nCREW MEMBER: Right away, Admiral.\\nPOE: Yeah, I was afraid you\\'d say that. Vice Admiral Holdo, I am relieving you of your command for the survival of this ship, its crew, and the Resistance.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: I hope you understand what you\\'re doing.\\nPOE: Yeah. I\\'m going to the bridge. If they move, stun them.\\n\\nOFFICER #1: ....at least three cycles so far.\\nOFFICER #2: Yes, sir. We\\'re working on it.\\nOFFICER #3: I will do my best, sir.\\nFINN: Almost there.\\n\\nREY: You don\\'t have to do this. I feel the conflict in you. It\\'s tearing you apart. Ben, when we touched hands, I saw your future. Just the shape of it, but solid and clear. You will not bow before Snoke. You will turn. I\\'ll help you. I saw it.\\nKYLO REN: I saw something, too. Because of what I saw, I know when the moment comes, you\\'ll be the one to turn. You\\'ll stand with me. Rey, I saw who your parents are.\\nSNOKE: Well done, my good and faithful apprentice. My faith in you is restored. Young Rey. Welcome.\\n\\nFINN: So this is it? The tracker\\'s right behind this door.\\nDJ: Haysian smelt. Best conductor. And you\\'re welcome.\\nROSE: Good time to figure out how to get back to the fleet?\\nFINN: I know where the nearest escape pods are.\\nROSE: Course you do.\\nPOE: BB-8, tell me something good.\\nFINN: Poe, we\\'re almost there. Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.\\n\\nPOE: Yeah, I\\'m on it pal. You just hurry. Clear the bridge, escort the officers down to the hangar.\\nC-3PO: Commander.... Captain Dameron, Admiral Holdo was looking for you.\\nPOE: Yeah, we spoke.\\nC-3PO: Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.\\nPOE: Good instinct, 3PO. Go with that. Seal that door!\\n\\nROSE: We\\'re running out of time.\\nFINN: Come on, how\\'s it going?\\nDJ: Almost there.\\n\\nPOE: 3PO, where do you think you\\'re going?\\nC-3PO: It would be quite against my programming to be party to a mutiny.\\nPOE: Hey!\\nC-3PO: It is not correct protocol. Oh! Neither is this!\\n\\nPOE: Finn? We\\'re ready to make the jump.\\nFINN: Now or never.\\nDJ: Now.\\nFINN: You\\'re up.\\nSTORMTROOPER #1: You there, hands up!\\nSTORMTROOPER #2: Watch \\'em, watch \\'em.\\nSTORMTROOPER #3: Drop your weapons, now!\\nSTORMTROOPER #4: Hands up, Rebel scum.\\nSTORMTROOPER #3: Get down! I said, down!\\nPHASMA: FN-2187. So good to have you back.\\nPOE: They didn\\'t make it. Leia.\\n\\nANNOUNCER: Please board the transports according to your evacuation designation. All transports must be cleared....\\nGURNEY OPERATOR: OK, help me push him up, guys.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: That one\\'s a troublemaker. I like him.\\nLEIA: Me, too. Now, time to board your transport.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: For the transports to escape, someone needs to stay behind and pilot the cruiser.\\nLEIA: Too many losses. I can\\'t take anymore.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: Sure you can. You taught me how.\\nLEIA AND AMILYN HOLDO: May the Force be....\\nLEIA: You go on. I\\'ve said it enough.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: May the Force be with you always.\\nPILOT: Cloaking device activated. We should be off their scopes.\\nLARMA D\\'ACY: Let\\'s hope this works.\\n\\nSNOKE: Come closer, child. So much strength. Darkness rises, and light to meet it. I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the light would rise. Skywalker.... I assumed. Wrongly. Closer, I said.\\nREY: You underestimate Skywalker, and Ben Solo, and me. It will be your downfall.\\nSNOKE: Oh.... have you seen something? A weakness in my apprentice. Is that why you came? Young fool. It was I who bridged your minds. I stoked Ren\\'s conflicted soul. I knew he was not strong enough to hide it from you. And you were not wise enough to resist the bait. And now, you will give me Skywalker. Then I will kill you with the cruelest stroke.\\nREY: No.\\nSNOKE: Yes. Give me everything.\\nREY: No! No! No!\\n\\nPOE: No. No. No, no, no!\\nLEIA: Poe.\\nPOE: What is that?\\nLARMA D\\'ACY: The mineral planet, Crait. An uncharted hideout from the days of the Rebellion.\\nPOE: That\\'s a Rebel base?\\nLARMA D\\'ACY: Abandoned, but heavily armored with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.\\nLEIA: Holdo knew the First Order was tracking our big ship. They\\'re not monitoring for little transports.\\nPOE: So we could slip down to the surface unnoticed and hide till the First Order passes. That could work.\\nLEIA: She was more interested in protecting the light than she was seeming like a hero.\\nAMILYN HOLDO: Godspeed, Rebels.\\n\\nARMITAGE HUX: Well done, Phasma.\\nPHASMA: Your ship and payment, as we agreed.\\nROSE: You lying snake.\\nDJ: We got caught, I cut a d-d-d-deal.\\nFINN: Wait, cut a deal with what?\\nFIRST ORDER OFFICER: Sir, we checked on the information from the thief. We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough, 30 Resistance transports have just launched from the cruiser.\\nARMITAGE HUX: He told us the truth. Will wonders never cease?\\nROSE: No.\\nARMITAGE HUX: Our weapons are ready?\\nFIRST ORDER OFFICER: Ready and aimed, sir.\\nARMITAGE HUX: Fire at will.\\nFINN: Wait. No, no. No, you can\\'t!\\nROSE: No!\\nPILOT: Admiral, we\\'re taking fire! Do we turn around?\\nAMILYN HOLDO: No, you\\'re too far out. Full speed to planetfall. Full speed!\\n\\nSNOKE: Well, well, I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise. We will give him and the Jedi Order the death he desires. After the Rebels are gone, we will go to his planet and obliterate the entire island. Such spunk. Look here now. The entire Resistance on those transports. Soon they will all be gone. For you, all is lost. Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope. You have the spirit of a true Jedi! And because of that, you must die. My worthy apprentice, son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader. Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve. Where there was weakness, strength. Complete your training, and fulfill your destiny.\\nKYLO REN: I know what I have to do.\\nREY: Ben.\\nSNOKE: You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed, I cannot be beaten. I see his mind, I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child, he ignites it, and kills his true enemy!\\n\\nPOE: Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed!\\nCOVA NELL: I am, sir.\\n\\nFINN: You murdering bastard!\\nDJ: T-T-T-Take it easy, Big F. They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It\\'s just business.\\nFINN: You\\'re wrong.\\nDJ: Maybe.\\n\\nREY: Ben! The fleet. Order them to stop firing. There\\'s still time to save the fleet. Ben?\\nKYLO REN: It\\'s time to let old things die. Snoke, Skywalker. The Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels.... let it all die. Rey. I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy.\\nREY: Don\\'t do this, Ben. Please don\\'t go this way.\\nKYLO REN: No, no. You\\'re still holding on! Let go! Do you wanna know the truth about your parents? Or have you always known? And you\\'ve just hidden it away. You know the truth. Say it. Say it.\\nREY: They were nobody.\\nKYLO REN: They were filthy junk traders who sold you off for drinking money. They\\'re dead in a paupers\\' grave in the Jakku desert. You have no place in this story. You come from nothing. You\\'re nothing. But not to me. Join me. Please.\\n\\nFIRST ORDER OFFICER: Sir, the Resistance cruiser\\'s preparing to jump to lightspeed.\\nARMITAGE HUX: It\\'s empty. They\\'re just trying to pull our attention away. Pathetic. Keep your fire on the transports. \\n\\nPHASMA: Execution by blaster is too good for them. Let\\'s make this hurt.\\nROSE: Finn.\\nPHASMA: On my command.\\n\\nKAYDEL KO CONNIX: She\\'s running away.\\nPOE: No, she isn\\'t.\\n\\nEDRISON PEAVEY: No!\\nARMITAGE HUX: Fire on that cruiser!\\n\\nPHASMA: Execute.\\n\\nROSE: Finn! There\\'s a shuttle back that way! We gotta go!\\nPHASMA: Traitor! What?\\nROSE: Finn!\\nPHASMA: You are a bug in the system.\\nFINN: Let\\'s go, chrome-dome. Come on!\\nROSE: No!\\nFINN: Hey.\\nPHASMA: You were always scum.\\nFINN: Rebel scum.\\nROSE: Hey! Need a lift?\\n\\nARMITAGE HUX: What happened?\\nKYLO REN: The girl murdered Snoke. What happened?\\nARMITAGE HUX: She took Snoke\\'s escape craft.\\nKYLO REN: We know where she\\'s going. Get all our forces down to that Resistance base. Let\\'s finish this.\\nARMITAGE HUX: Finish this? Who do you think you\\'re talking to? You presumed to command my army? Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler!\\nKYLO REN: The Supreme Leader is dead.\\nARMITAGE HUX: Long live the Supreme Leader.\\n\\nLEIA: They\\'re coming, shut the door.\\nRESISTANCE SOLDIER: Incoming!\\nPOE: Go, go, move! Get that shield door down!\\nROSE: No! Wait, don\\'t shoot! It\\'s us! No, don\\'t shoot!\\nPOE: Hold your fire!\\nFINN: Don\\'t shoot!\\nPOE: Hold your fire!\\nLEIA: Finn?\\nPOE: Finn! Rose! You\\'re not dead! Where\\'s my droid? Buddy! I\\'m so glad to see you! Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, slow down.\\nROSE: Is this all that\\'s left?\\n\\nPOE: All right, our shields are up so they can\\'t hit us from orbit. Use whatever power we\\'ve got left to broadcast a distress signal to the Outer Rim.\\nLEIA: Use my personal code. If there are any allies to the Resistance, it\\'s now or never.\\nPOE: Rose, what do you got?\\nROSE: Rotting munitions, rusted artillery, some half-gutted skim speeders.\\nPOE: Well, let\\'s just pray that big-ass door holds long enough for us to get help.\\nFINN: A battering ram cannon.\\nPOE: A what now?\\nFINN: Miniaturized Death Star tech. It\\'ll crack that door open like an egg.\\nROSE: There has to be a back way out of here, right?\\nPOE: BB-8, what do you got?\\nC-3PO: BB-8 has analyzed the mine\\'s schematics. This is the only way in or out.\\nFINN: Come on. We have allies. People believe in Leia. They\\'ll get our message, they\\'ll come. But we have to buy time.

GALAXY - PLANET HOTH\\n\\n\\'\\'A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its underside.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice- covered surface. An explosion marks the point of impact.\\'\\'\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY\\n\\n\\'\\'A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind. A strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater. The ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance.\\'\\'\\n\\nEXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY\\n\\n\\'\\'A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. The bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun. Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop. Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the sky. He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'The wind whips at Luke\\'s fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter. His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'LUKE\\'\\'\\': (into comlink) Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? After a little static a familiar voice is heard.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'HAN\\'\\'\\': (over comlink) Loud and clear, kid. What\\'s up?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'LUKE\\'\\'\\': (into comlink) Well, I finished my circle. I don\\'t pick up any life readings.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'HAN\\'\\'\\': (over comlink) There isn\\'t enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed, I\\'m going back.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'LUKE\\'\\'\\': (into comlink) Right. I\\'ll see you shortly. There\\'s a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won\\'t take long.\\n\\n\\'\\'Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard. He pats the beast on the head to calm it.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'LUKE\\'\\'\\': Hey, steady girl. What\\'s the matter? You smell something?\\n\\n\\'\\'Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind. He hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over him. It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'LUKE\\'\\'\\': Aaargh!\\n\\n\\'\\'Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw. He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain.\\'\\'\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY\\n\\n\\'\\'A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous ice cave.\\'\\'\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK\\n\\n\\'\\'Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing their new base. The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls off his goggles.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which is parked among several fighters. Mechanics, R2 units, and various other droids hurry about. Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter. Chewie stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated greeting to his boss.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'HAN\\'\\'\\': Chewie!\\n\\n\\'\\'The Wookiee grumbles a reply.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'HAN\\'\\'\\': All right, don\\'t lose your temper. I\\'ll come right back and give you a hand.\\n\\n\\'\\'Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han leaves.\\'\\'\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER\\n\\nA makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick ice. The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals.\\n\\n\\'\\'General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han\\'s approach.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'RIEEKAN\\'\\'\\': Solo?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'HAN\\'\\'\\': No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You\\'ll know if anything comes around.\\n\\nRIEEKAN Commander Skywalker reported in yet?\\n\\nHAN No. He\\'s checking out a meteorite that hit near him.\\n\\nRIEEKAN (indicates radar screen) With all the meteor activity in this system, it\\'s going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.\\n\\nTaking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.\\n\\nHAN General, I\\'ve got to leave. I can\\'t stay anymore.\\n\\nPrincess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants. Her hair is braided across her head in a Nordic fashion. She overhears their conversation and seems somewhat distressed.\\n\\nRIEEKAN I\\'m sorry to hear that.\\n\\nHAN Well, there\\'s a price on my head. If I don\\'t pay off Jabba the Hut, I\\'m a dead man.\\n\\nRIEEKAN A death mark\\'s not an easy thing to live with. You\\'re a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.\\n\\nHAN Thank you, General.\\n\\nHe turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.\\n\\nHAN (with feeling) Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.\\n\\nLEIA That\\'s right.\\n\\nLeia is angry. Han sees she has no warmth to offer him. He shakes his head and adopts a sarcastic tone.\\n\\nHAN (cooly) Well, don\\'t get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.\\n\\nHan walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center. Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR\\n\\nLEIA Han!\\n\\nHan stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.\\n\\nHAN Yes, Your Highnessness?\\n\\nLEIA I thought you decided to stay.\\n\\nHAN Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.\\n\\nLEIA Han, we need you!\\n\\nHAN We?\\n\\nLEIA Yes.\\n\\nHAN Oh, what about you need?\\n\\nLEIA (mystified) I need? I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\n\\nHAN (shakes his head, fed up) You probably don\\'t.\\n\\nLEIA And what precisely am I supposed to know?\\n\\nHAN Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.\\n\\nLEIA Yes. You\\'re a great help to us. You\\'re a natural leader...\\n\\nHAN No! That\\'s not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on.\\n\\nLeia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.\\n\\nLEIA You\\'re imagining things.\\n\\nHAN Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?\\n\\nLEIA I\\'d just as soon kiss a Wookiee.\\n\\nHAN I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!\\n\\nAngrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR\\n\\nA familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo- Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an ice wall toward the main hangar.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Don\\'t try to blame me. I didn\\'t ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess\\' chamber. But it\\'s supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don\\'t know.\\n\\nArtoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, switch off.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK\\n\\nThe two robots stop at Han Solo\\'s space freighter. Han and Chewie are struggling with their central lifters.\\n\\nHAN (to Chewie) Why do you take this apart now? I\\'m trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.\\n\\nChewie grumbles in irritation.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Excuse me, sir.\\n\\nHAN (to Chewie) Put them back together right now.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Might I have a word with you, please?\\n\\nHAN What do you want?\\n\\nTHREEPIO Well, it\\'s Princess Leia, sir. She\\'s been trying to get you on the communicator.\\n\\nHAN I turned it off. I don\\'t want to talk to her.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn\\'t come back yet. She doesn\\'t know where he is.\\n\\nHAN I don\\'t know where he is.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Nobody knows where he is.\\n\\nHAN What do you mean, \"nobody knows\"?\\n\\nHan glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as night slowly begins to fall on the planet.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Well, uh, you see...\\n\\nHan jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.\\n\\nHAN Deck Officer. Deck Officer!\\n\\nTHREEPIO Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu...\\n\\nHan abruptly puts his hand over Threepio\\'s mouth as the deck officer approaches.\\n\\nDECK OFFICER Yes, sir?\\n\\nHAN Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?\\n\\nDECK OFFICER I haven\\'t seen him. It\\'s possible he came in through the south entrance.\\n\\nHAN It\\'s possible? Why don\\'t you go find out? It\\'s getting dark out there.\\n\\nDECK OFFICER Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio\\'s mouth.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what\\'s going on?\\n\\nHAN Why not?\\n\\nTHREEPIO Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let\\'s find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL\\n\\nThe deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the tunnel.\\n\\nDECK OFFICER Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn\\'t come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.\\n\\nHAN Not likely. Are the speeders ready?\\n\\nDECK OFFICER Not yet. We\\'re having some trouble adapting them to the cold.\\n\\nHAN Then we\\'ll have to go out on Tauntauns.\\n\\nDECK OFFICER Sir, the temperature\\'s dropping too rapidly.\\n\\nHAN That\\'s right. And my friends out in it.\\n\\nASSISTANT OFFICER I\\'ll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha.\\n\\nHan pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.\\n\\nDECK OFFICER Your Tauntaun\\'ll freeze before you reach the first marker.\\n\\nHAN Then I\\'ll see you in hell!\\n\\nHan maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter night.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK\\n\\nThe jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a Hoth day. Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor. One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood. He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls. Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.\\n\\nExhausted, he drops back into his hanging position. As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach.\\n\\nHe focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.\\n\\nJust as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into Luke\\'s hand.\\n\\nThe young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice. He flops to the snow in a heap. The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking. Luke scrambles to his feet. He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK\\n\\nLuke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight. Weak and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK\\n\\nA small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile vastness of snow and cold. As it runs, the Tauntaun\\'s legs kick up large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE HANGAR - DUSK\\n\\nArtoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly. Threepio moves stiffly over to him.\\n\\nTHREEPIO You must come along now, Artoo. There\\'s really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.\\n\\nArtoo beeps, long and low.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Don\\'t say thing like that! Of course we\\'ll see Master Luke again. He\\'ll be quite all right, you\\'ll see. (to himself) Stupid little short-circuit. He\\'ll be quite all right.\\n\\nThreepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully keeps his vigil.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK\\n\\nThe wind is blowing quite strong now. Luke struggles to stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over. He struggles to get up, but he can\\'t. The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT\\n\\nPrincess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes. She shivers in the cold wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands. In the background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.\\n\\nA Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with the princess.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT Sir, all the patrols are in. There\\'s still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Mistress Leia, Artoo says he\\'s been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.\\n\\nLeia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.\\n\\nDERLIN Your Highness, there\\'s nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed.\\n\\nHe turns to the lieutenant.\\n\\nDERLIN Close the doors.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe lieutenant walks away. Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, somewhat like a coyote. At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex series of efficient beeps.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one.\\n\\nLeia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the entrance of the ice cave. The loud booms echo throughout the huge cavern. Chewie lets out another suffering howl.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don\\'t worry about Master Luke. I\\'m sure he\\'ll be all right. He\\'s quite clever, you know... for a human being.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK\\n\\nLuke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious. Slowly he looks up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow. It is hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.\\n\\nBEN Luke... Luke.\\n\\nLUKE (weakly) Ben?\\n\\nBEN You will go to the Dagobah system.\\n\\nLUKE Dagobah system?\\n\\nBEN There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.\\n\\nThe image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching from the windswept horizon.\\n\\nLUKE (groaning faintly) Ben... Ben.\\n\\nLuke drops into unconsciousness.\\n\\nHan pulls up and leaps off his mount. He hurries to his snow-covered friend, cradling him in his arms. Han\\'s Tauntaun lets out a low, pitiful bellow. But Han\\'s concern is with Luke, and he shakes him urgently.\\n\\nHAN Luke! Luke! Don\\'t do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here.\\n\\nLuke doesn\\'t respond. Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping Luke\\'s unconscious face. As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a rasping sound behind him. He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow.\\n\\nHan carries Luke to the moaning beast. Then, with a final groan, the Tauntaun expires.\\n\\nHAN Not much time.\\n\\nHe pushes Luke\\'s inert form against the belly of the dead beast.\\n\\nLUKE (moaning) Ben... Ben...\\n\\nHAN Hang on, kid.\\n\\nLUKE Dagobah system...\\n\\nHan ignites Luke\\'s saber and cuts the beast from head to toe. He quickly tosses it\\'s steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke\\'s inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.\\n\\nHAN (reeling from the odor) Whew...\\n\\nLUKE Dagobah...\\n\\nHAN This may smell bad, kid...\\n\\nLUKE (moaning) Yoda...\\n\\nHAN ...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter built. (struggling to get Luke inside the carcass) Ooh... I thought they smelled bad on the outside!\\n\\nThe wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move. Han removes a pack from the dead creature\\'s back, taking out a shelter container. He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection against a bitter Hoth night.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN\\n\\nFour snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.\\n\\nINT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT\\n\\nThere is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft. He concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit. He hears a low beep from one of his monitors.\\n\\nZEV (into transmitter) Echo Base... I\\'ve got something! Not much, but it could be a life form.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT\\n\\nThe small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new direction.\\n\\nINT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT\\n\\nThe pilot switches over to a new transmitter.\\n\\nZEV (into transmitter) This is Rogue Two. this is Rogue Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two.\\n\\nThere is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.\\n\\nHAN (filtered over Zev\\'s receiver) Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.\\n\\nZEV (switching transmitters) Echo Base... this is Rogue Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY\\n\\nThe small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side. A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift. Han spots Zev\\'s snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his arms frantically at the tiny craft.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER\\n\\nStrange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment. A switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank filled with a thick, gelatinous slime. He begins to thrash about, raving in delirium.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM\\n\\nLuke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling. His face shows terrible wounds from the Wampa\\'s attack. Threepio and Artoo enter the room.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Master Luke, sir, it\\'s so good to see you fully functional again.\\n\\nArtoo beeps his good wishes.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Artoo expresses his relief, also.\\n\\nHan and Chewie make their entrance. The Wookiee growls a greeting.\\n\\nHAN How are you feeling, kid? You don\\'t look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.\\n\\nLUKE Thanks to you.\\n\\nHAN That\\'s two you owe me, junior.\\n\\nHan turns as Leia enters the room. He looks at her with a big, devilish grin.\\n\\nHAN Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.\\n\\nLEIA (haughtily) I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it\\'s dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we\\'ve activated the energy shield.\\n\\nHAN That\\'s a good story. I think you just can\\'t bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.\\n\\nLEIA I don\\'t know where you get your delusions, laser brain.\\n\\nChewie is amused; he laughs in his manner. Han, enjoying himself, regards Chewie good-humoredly.\\n\\nHAN Laugh it up, fuzzball. But you didn\\'t see us alone in the south passage.\\n\\nLuke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.\\n\\nHAN She expressed her true feelings for me.\\n\\nLeia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.\\n\\nLEIA My...! Why, you stuck up,... half- witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf- herder!\\n\\nHAN Who\\'s scruffy-looking? (to Luke) I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?\\n\\nLeia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she focuses on Luke.\\n\\nLEIA Why, I guess you don\\'t know everything about women yet?\\n\\nWith that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips. Then she turns on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly dumbstruck. With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head and grins.\\n\\nSuddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.\\n\\nANNOUNCER (over loudspeaker) Headquarters personnel, report to command center.\\n\\nThe voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.\\n\\nHAN Take it easy.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Excuse us, please.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER\\n\\nRieekan looks up grimly from a console screen. He calls over to Leia and Han.\\n\\nRIEEKAN Princess... we have a visitor.\\n\\nThe group hurries over to Rieekan.\\n\\nRIEEKAN We\\'ve picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east.\\n\\nSENIOR CONTROLLER It\\'s metal.\\n\\nLEIA Then it couldn\\'t be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.\\n\\nHAN It could be a speeder, one of ours.\\n\\nSENIOR CONTROLLER No. Wait - there\\'s something very weak coming through.\\n\\nThreepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the strange signal.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.\\n\\nThe transmission ends in static.\\n\\nHAN It isn\\'t friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let\\'s check it out.\\n\\nRIEEKAN Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY\\n\\nThe dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three- eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base. It raises a large antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing signal.\\n\\nThe probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has popped his head over a snow bank. Instantly, the probe robot swings around, its deadly ray ready to fire. But before it can get a shot off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million pieces.\\n\\nHan Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER\\n\\nLeia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.\\n\\nHAN (over comlink) Afraid there\\'s not much left.\\n\\nLEIA (into comlink) What was it?\\n\\nHAN (over comlink) Droid of some kind. I didn\\'t hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.\\n\\nLEIA (into comlink) An Imperial probe droid.\\n\\nHAN (over comlink) It\\'s a good bet the Empire knows we\\'re here.\\n\\nRIEEKAN We\\'d better start the evacuation.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET\\n\\nDarth Vader\\'s Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of space. The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft. TIE fighters dart to and fro.\\n\\nINT. DARTH VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK\\n\\nControllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls. The squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the approaching presence and turn toward it. Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, enters like a chill wind. As Vader moves across the wide bridge, Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.\\n\\nPIETT Admiral.\\n\\nOZZEL Yes, Captain\\n\\nPIETT I think we\\'ve got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it\\'s the best lead we\\'ve had.\\n\\nOZZEL (irritated) We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!\\n\\nPIETT The visuals indicate life readings.\\n\\nOZZEL It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...\\n\\nPIETT But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.\\n\\nVader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base. Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance.\\n\\nVADER You found something?\\n\\nPIETT Yes, my lord.\\n\\nVADER (studying the image on the console screen) That\\'s it. The Rebels are there.\\n\\nOZZEL My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be...\\n\\nVADER That is the system. And I\\'m sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - TRANSPORT BAY\\n\\nA captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the main transport bay. Several Rebel transports behind them are being loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in panic.\\n\\nREBEL CAPTAIN Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch.\\n\\nREBEL FIGHTER Right, sir.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK\\n\\nAlarms sound. Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert stations. Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near the main entrance.\\n\\nIn the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the lifters of the Millennium Falcon.\\n\\nHan finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor. He pulls out his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters.\\n\\nHAN (into comlink, to Chewie) Okay, that\\'s it. Try it... Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off!\\n\\nSmoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter. Exasperated, Han surveys the new damage.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER\\n\\nLuke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical droid stands by.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.\\n\\nLUKE Well, forget the heavy equipment. There\\'s plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID Take care, sir.\\n\\nLUKE Thanks.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK\\n\\nPilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about. Luke, pulling on his heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders. He stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before.\\n\\nLUKE Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?\\n\\nAs Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and gives him a tight hug. Han is discussing the lifter with a repair droid when he sees Luke.\\n\\nHAN Hi, kid. (to droid) There\\'s got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?\\n\\nLUKE Yeah.\\n\\nHAN Be careful.\\n\\nLUKE You, too.\\n\\nLuke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on. After a few steps, he stops and looks back. Han glances up and the two exchange a silent communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things, all difficult to verbalize.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM.\\n\\nAlarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base. In the control room, a controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer scan.\\n\\nCONTROLLER General, there\\'s a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four.\\n\\nRIEEKAN Reroute all power to the energy shield. We\\'ve got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.\\n\\nRieekan exits hurriedly.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER\\'S CHAMBER - MEDITATION CUBICLE\\n\\nThe dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube. General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving Vader. Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord. The younger general stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks.\\n\\nVADER What is it, General?\\n\\nVEERS My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.\\n\\nVADER (angrily) The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.\\n\\nVEERS He felt surprise was wiser...\\n\\nVADER He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.\\n\\nVEERS Yes, my lord.\\n\\nVeers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen showing the bridge of his mighty ship. Admiral Ozzel appears on the viewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett.\\n\\nOZZEL Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we\\'re preparing to... Aaagh!\\n\\nVADER You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.\\n\\nPiett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused, touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully.\\n\\nPIETT Yes, my lord.\\n\\nVADER Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett.\\n\\nPIETT Thank you, Lord Vader.\\n\\nPiett\\'s pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed emotion. He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK\\n\\nWith a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered in the center of the hangar.\\n\\nLEIA All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they\\'re loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you\\'ll have to stay very close to your transports.\\n\\nHOBBIE Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?\\n\\nLEIA The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you\\'ve gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?\\n\\nPILOTS (in unison) Right. Okay.\\n\\nLEIA Good luck.\\n\\nDERLIN Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let\\'s go!\\n\\nThe pilots hurry away.\\n\\nEXT.

SPACE - HOTH - REBEL TRANSPORT\\n\\nThe Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet, closely followed by the two red energy beams.\\n\\nAs the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial Star Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts. The Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull.\\n\\nThe big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control. As the Imperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away to safety.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK\\n\\nPilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and their vehicles.\\n\\nANNOUNCER (over loudspeaker) The first transport is away.\\n\\nEveryone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar. Luke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder. His gunner, Dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him. They climb in.\\n\\nDACK Feeling all right, sir?\\n\\nLUKE Just like new, Dack. How about you?\\n\\nDACK Right now I feel like I could take on the whole Empire myself.\\n\\nLUKE (quietly, strapping in) I know what you mean.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN\\n\\nA thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape. Small dot-size objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the Rebel base.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH\\n\\nA Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes. Through the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker. He adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the ominous battle machines. Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the guns of the lumbering snow walkers.\\n\\nThe officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding begins to make the ground vibrate. The pounding grows louder and is accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling. The officer speaks into his comlink.\\n\\nTRENCH OFFICER Echo Station Three-T-Eight.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - CORRIDOR\\n\\nPilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders.

IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT\\n\\nGeneral Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine forward.\\n\\nLuke\\'s speeder banks in from the side of Veers\\'s walker and heads straight for its viewport, blasting away. An explosion hits the walker window, but dissipates, doing no harm. The speeder roars up and over the impregnable war machine.\\n\\nINT. LUKE\\'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT\\n\\nLuke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance.\\n\\nLUKE That armor\\'s too strong for blasters.\\n\\nOn the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke\\'s cockpit window, twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. (to Dack) All right, stand by, Dack.\\n\\nDack is at the gunner\\'s controls.\\n\\nDACK Luke, we\\'ve got a malfunction in fire control. I\\'ll have to cut in the auxiliary.\\n\\nLUKE Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.\\n\\nBarely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up his harpoon gun.\\n\\nLuke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker. Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course for the tiny craft.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD\\n\\nRogue Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the walker as explosions burst all around them.\\n\\nINT. LUKE\\'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT\\n\\nAfter sustaining a heavy volley of fire, Luke turns around to see if Dack is all right.\\n\\nLUKE Dack? Dack!\\n\\nDack is lost.

REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER\\n\\nApart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is strangely quiet and empty. Running footsteps echo through the freezing hallway, then Han appears. Cracks have appeared in some of the walls and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the underground hallways. Han hurries into the command center. It is a shambles, but some people are still at their posts. As he enters, a gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room. He finds Leia and Threepio near one of the control boards.\\n\\nHAN You all right?\\n\\nLeia nods. She is surprised to see him.\\n\\nLEIA Why are you still here?\\n\\nHAN I heard the command center had been hit.\\n\\nLEIA You got your clearance to leave.\\n\\nHAN Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll leave.

He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing overhead.\\n\\nRunning beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at the walker\\'s underside. A thin cable follows the projectile from the gun. The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.\\n\\nStill running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his belt buckle. Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling underneath the walker.\\n\\nThe walker\\'s giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen snow. Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to the walker\\'s hull, reaching a small hatch. Hanging precariously, Luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.\\n\\nHe takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the Imperial machine. Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below. He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by - and just misses him.\\n\\nThe giant walker stops in mid-step. A muffled explosion comes from within - and then the walker\\'s mechanical insides are spewed out every conceivable opening. The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like a locomotive on stilts.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD\\n\\nVeers\\'s walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.

The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a few reassuring words. As he searches worriedly for his captain, something at last catches his eye.\\n\\nChewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward the ship. The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl, then runs up the ship\\'s ramp. Han and Leia run up the ramp after him, closely followed by Threepio.\\n\\nHAN Hurry up, goldenrod, or you\\'re going to be a permanent resident!\\n\\nTHREEPIO Wait! Wait!\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR\\n\\nImperial troops run through the base corridors. Vader surveys the place. A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but he calmly, purposefully, continues around it.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGER - MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nA distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck. Ice cakes come crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.\\n\\nINT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD\\n\\nHan, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as Chewie watches a troublesome gauge. A worried Leia observes their efforts.\\n\\nHAN (to Chewie) How\\'s this?\\n\\nThe Wookiee barks a negative reply.\\n\\nLEIA Would it helped if I got out and pushed?\\n\\nHAN It might.\\n\\nThreepio clanks into the hold.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, might I suggest that you...\\n\\nHan gives the gold robot a devastating look.\\n\\nTHREEPIO It can wait.\\n\\nINT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nThey move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches. Leia watches him, impatient, disbelieving.\\n\\nLEIA This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.\\n\\nHAN This baby\\'s got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.\\n\\nHan and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.\\n\\nQuickly, Han straps himself into the pilot\\'s seat and Leia into the navigator\\'s chair.\\n\\nINT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR\\n\\nStormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon. Behind them the giant hangar doors open slowly.\\n\\nEXT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nA laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the Imperial troops.\\n\\nThe stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by the Falcon\\'s fire and are thrown about in all directions.\\n\\nINT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nChewie rushes into the cockpit.\\n\\nHAN Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let\\'s hope we don\\'t have a burnout.\\n\\nA laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair. Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and the first stage of engine fire can be heard. Han flashes a big grin at Leia.\\n\\nHAN See?\\n\\nLEIA Someday you\\'re going to be wrong, and I hope I\\'m there to see it.\\n\\nHan looks at Chewie.\\n\\nHAN Punch it!\\n\\nThe roar of the Falcon\\'s main engines blasts out everything as the ice- cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.\\n\\nINT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR\\n\\nMore stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader. Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon\\'s engines, Vader looks toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and disappear outside the cave.\\n\\nEXT. HOTH - ICE SLOPE - DAY\\n\\nLuke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above them, flying very close to the ground.\\n\\nThe three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing fighters, each going to his own ship. Luke waves farewell, then heads toward his own fighter.\\n\\nArtoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke climbs aboard the spacecraft.\\n\\nLUKE Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.\\n\\nFrom his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for takeoff.\\n\\nWEDGE Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.\\n\\nLuke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.\\n\\nLUKE Don\\'t worry, Artoo. We\\'re going, we\\'re going.\\n\\nThe canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - LUKE\\'S X-WING\\n\\nLuke\\'s fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet. Soon it disappears into the stars.\\n\\nINT. LUKE\\'S X-WING - COCKPIT\\n\\nLuke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision. He flips several switches. The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn. The X-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction.\\n\\nThe monitor screen on Luke\\'s control panel prints out a question from the concerned Artoo.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) There\\'s nothing wrong, Artoo. I\\'m just setting a new course.\\n\\nArtoo beeps once again.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) We\\'re not going to regroup with the others.\\n\\nArtoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, \"What?!\"\\n\\nLuke reads Artoo\\'s exclamation on his control panel.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) We\\'re going to the Dagobah system.\\n\\nLuke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments. He rides along with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence. Finally, Artoo chirps up.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) Yes, Artoo?\\n\\nArtoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink, chuckling) That\\'s all right. I\\'d like to keep it on manual control for a while.\\n\\nThe little droid lets out a defeated whimper. Luke smiles, and continues on his course.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.\\n\\nAs it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized objects.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nInside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl. Han checks as the ship is buffeted by exploding flak. He appears to be doing six things at once.\\n\\nHAN (harried) I saw them! I saw them!\\n\\nLEIA Saw what?\\n\\nHAN Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.\\n\\nThreepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, sir! Might I suggest...\\n\\nHAN (to Leia) Shut him up or shut him down! (to Chewie) Check the deflector shield!\\n\\nChewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.\\n\\nHAN Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star Destroyers. Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight down, closely followed by four TIE fighters. The underside of the Star Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star Destroyers. Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.\\n\\nINT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen veering to the left.\\n\\nIMPERIAL OFFICER Take evasive action!\\n\\nAlarms sound all over the huge ship. The two other Star Destroyers get closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes brushing contact with it.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers, still followed by four TIE fighters. Laser bolts spark the pitch-black skies.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nThings have calmed down a bit, but the race isn\\'t over yet. Chewie barks at Han. Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive. The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.\\n\\nHAN Prepare to make the jump to light- speed.\\n\\nTHREEPIO But, sir!\\n\\nThe buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.\\n\\nLEIA They\\'re getting closer!\\n\\nHAN (with a gleam in his eye) Oh yeah? Watch this.\\n\\nExpectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into hyperspace, but just sit there.\\n\\nHan and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of concern.\\n\\nLEIA Watch what?\\n\\nHan tries again. Still nothing.\\n\\nHAN I think we\\'re in trouble.\\n\\nTHREEPIO If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It\\'s impossible to go to light-speed!\\n\\nHAN We\\'re in trouble!\\n\\nThe explosions become heavier.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYER\\n\\nThe Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nStars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon\\'s window.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD\\n\\nHan works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders to Chewie.\\n\\nHAN Horizontal boosters...! (Chewie barks) Alluvial dampers...! Well that\\'s not it. (Chewie barks) Bring me the hydrospanners!\\n\\nChewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.\\n\\nHAN I don\\'t know how we\\'re going to get out of this one.\\n\\nSuddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch radically. Chewie barks. The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.\\n\\nHAN Oww! Chewie!\\n\\nMore turbulence rocks the ship.\\n\\nHAN That was no laser blast! Something hit us.\\n\\nLEIA (over comlink) Han, get up here!\\n\\nHAN Come on, Chewie!\\n\\nHan climbs out of the hold like a shot. Both he and Chewie run out of the hold and toward the cockpit.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nOut the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.\\n\\nLEIA Asteroids!\\n\\nHan changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie gets into his chair. Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses in front of the ship.\\n\\nHAN Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven- one.\\n\\nLEIA What are you doing? You\\'re not actually going into an asteroid field?\\n\\nHAN They\\'d be crazy to follow us, wouldn\\'t they?\\n\\nAnother asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.\\n\\nLEIA You don\\'t have to do this to impress me.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.\\n\\nHAN Never tell me the odds!\\n\\nEXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nThe Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.\\n\\nA large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon\\'s path at top speed. Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small explosions on its surface. Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in every direction, some colliding and exploding. The tiny Millennium Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the asteroids.\\n\\nOne of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and explodes. The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of smaller explosions.\\n\\nTwo huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly banks around both of them. The three TIE fighters follow in hot pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out of control into deep space.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELT\\n\\nThe massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the Falcon. Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.\\n\\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELT\\n\\nThe Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid. Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nAsteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft through the dangerous field.\\n\\nLooking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.\\n\\nChewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch. Threepio\\'s hands cover his eyes. He manages a short peek at the cockpit window. Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action. Han gives her a quick look.\\n\\nHAN You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.\\n\\nLEIA I take it back. We\\'re going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.\\n\\nThe group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.\\n\\nHAN I\\'m not going to argue with that.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Pulverized?\\n\\nHAN I\\'m going in closer to one of those big ones.\\n\\nLEIA Closer?\\n\\nTHREEPIO Closer?!\\n\\nChewbacca barks the same word, only louder.\\n\\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized asteroids. There is a continued display of explosions against the starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock. The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid. The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.\\n\\nThe TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles directly into their path. As the asteroid continues on its way, it leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep space.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nRattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in hysterics.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, this is suicide!\\n\\nHan notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful Wookiee, pointing.\\n\\nHAN There. That looks pretty good.\\n\\nLEIA What looks pretty good?\\n\\nHAN Yeah. That\\'ll do nicely.\\n\\nTHREEPIO (to Leia) Excuse me, ma\\'am, but where are we going?\\n\\nOut the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.\\n\\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLEIA I hope you know what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nHAN Yeah, me too.\\n\\nINT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER\\n\\nThe Falcon races down into the crater. The walls are barely visible as the ship speed through the tunnellike opening. A small cave appears on one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into it.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - LUKE\\'S X-WING\\n\\nThe tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah. Artoo, riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with some anxiety.\\n\\nINT. LUKE\\'S X-WING - COCKPIT\\n\\nLuke watches Artoo\\'s words as they are translated and screened on the computer scope.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) Yes, that\\'s it. Dagobah.\\n\\nArtoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) No, I\\'m not going to change my mind about this. (getting a little nervous) I\\'m not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There\\'s something alive down there...\\n\\nArtoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) Yes, I\\'m sure it\\'s perfectly safe for droids.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH - LUKE\\'S X-WING\\n\\nThe X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud- covered planet.\\n\\nINT. LUKE\\'S X-WING - COCKPIT\\n\\nLuke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet. He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has completely obscured his vision. An alarm buzzes in the background, Artoo beeps and whistles frantically.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can\\'t see a thing! Just hang on, I\\'m going to start the landing cycle...\\n\\nThe blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo\\'s electronic squeals. Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the spacecraft stops. Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.\\n\\nEXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK\\n\\nThe mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog. Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out of his cubbyhole on the back. The young warrior surveys the fog, which is barely pierced by the ship\\'s landing lights. About all he can make out are some giant, twisted trees nearby. Artoo whistles anxiously.\\n\\nLUKE No, Artoo, you stay put. I\\'ll have a look around.\\n\\nArtoo lets out a short beep. As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.\\n\\nLUKE Artoo?\\n\\nLuke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.\\n\\nLUKE Artoo! Where are you?\\n\\nA small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is heard. The periscope starts to move to shore. Relieved, Luke starts running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.\\n\\nLUKE Artoo! You be more careful.\\n\\nThe outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.\\n\\nLuke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and turns to look for Artoo. The periscope still steadily moves toward shore.\\n\\nLUKE Artoo - that way!\\n\\nSuddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving toward the little droid. The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo\\'s metal hull. The droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.\\n\\nHolding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.\\n\\nLUKE Artoo!\\n\\nThe black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin to appear. Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of soft gray moss.\\n\\nLUKE Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You\\'re lucky you don\\'t taste very good. Anything broken?\\n\\nLuke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from his round metal body. Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.\\n\\nLUKE If you\\'re saying coming here was a bad idea, I\\'m beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It\\'s like... something out of a dream, or, I don\\'t know. Maybe I\\'m just going crazy.\\n\\nAs Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.\\n\\nEXT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER\\'S CHAMBER\\n\\nAdmiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader\\'s private cubicle.\\n\\nAfter a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising sight before him.\\n\\nDarth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far side of the chamber. A black, insectlike droid attends him. Among the various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts from Vader\\'s uncovered head. The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it. The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto Vader\\'s head. When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face Piett.\\n\\nVADER Yes, Admiral?\\n\\nPIETT Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But... it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...\\n\\nVADER (interrupting) Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses.\\n\\nPIETT Yes, lord.\\n\\nEXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nThe pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave. It is so dark that the cave\\'s exact dimensions are impossible to determine.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nHan and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems. Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.\\n\\nHAN I\\'m going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, I\\'m almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?\\n\\nChewie barks \"yes\". But Han thinks otherwise.\\n\\nHAN No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what\\'s wrong with the hyperdrive.\\n\\nSuddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit to go flying. Chewie howls.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, it\\'s quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.\\n\\nHAN Not entirely stable? I\\'m glad you\\'re here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh! Sometimes I just don\\'t understand human behavior. After all, I\\'m only trying to do my job in the most...\\n\\nThe sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he move back to the hold. Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia across the cabin into Han\\'s arms. Then, abruptly, the motion stops as suddenly as it started. With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they are in each other\\'s arms.\\n\\nLEIA Let go.\\n\\nHAN Sshh!\\n\\nLEIA Let go, please.\\n\\nLeia flushes, averting her eyes. She\\'s not exactly fighting to get free. But, of course, Han blows it...\\n\\nHAN Don\\'t get excited.\\n\\nThe anger rises in Leia.\\n\\nLEIA Captain, being held by you isn\\'t quite enough to get me excited.\\n\\nHAN Sorry, sweetheart. We haven\\'t got time for anything else.\\n\\nHan grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the door. Leia\\'s confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.\\n\\nEXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK\\n\\nThe mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking swamp.\\n\\nLuke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing. He ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it. Taking a power cable, he plugs it into Artoo\\'s noselike socket.\\n\\nLUKE Ready for some power? Okay. Let\\'s see now. Put that in there. There you go.\\n\\nThe droid whistles his appreciation. Luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater.\\n\\nLUKE (sighs) Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists.\\n\\nNervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.\\n\\nLUKE Still... there\\'s something familiar about this place. I feel like... I don\\'t know...\\n\\nSTRANGE VOICE Feel like what?\\n\\nLuke jumps out of his skin. Artoo screeches in terror. The young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the speaker. Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall. The wizened little thing is dressed in rags. It motions toward Luke\\'s sword.\\n\\nLUKE (looking at the creature) Like we\\'re being watched!\\n\\nCREATURE Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.\\n\\nAfter some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really doesn\\'t understand why. Artoo watches with interest.\\n\\nCREATURE I am wondering, why are you here?\\n\\nLUKE I\\'m looking for someone.\\n\\nCREATURE Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?\\n\\nThe little creature laughs.\\n\\nLUKE (Trying to keep from smiling) Right.\\n\\nCREATURE Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.\\n\\nLUKE I don\\'t think so. I\\'m looking for a great warrior.\\n\\nCREATURE Ahhh! A great warrior. (laughs and shakes his head) Wars not make one great.\\n\\nWith the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of the cases of supplies. He begins to rummage around.\\n\\nArtoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his disapproval.\\n\\nTheir tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from and takes a bite.\\n\\nLUKE Put that down. Hey! That\\'s my dinner!\\n\\nThe creature spits out the bite he has taken. He makes a face.\\n\\nCREATURE How you get so big, eating food of this kind?\\n\\nHe flips the container in Luke\\'s direction and reaches into one of Luke\\'s supply cases.\\n\\nLUKE Listen, friend, we didn\\'t mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can\\'t, so why don\\'t you just...\\n\\nCREATURE (teasing) Aww, cannot get your ship out?\\n\\nThe creature spots something of interest in Luke\\'s case. Luke loses patience and grabs the case away. The creature retains his prize - a tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.\\n\\nLUKE Hey, you could have broken this. Don\\'t do that. Ohhh... you\\'re making a mess. Hey, give me that!\\n\\nCREATURE (retreating with the lamp) Mine! Or I will help you not.\\n\\nClutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing closer to Artoo. As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo\\'s little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature.\\n\\nLUKE I don\\'t want your help. I want my lamp back. I\\'ll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.\\n\\nCREATURE Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.\\n\\nArtoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately engaged in a tug-of-war over it.\\n\\nArtoo beeps a few angry, \"Give me thats.\"\\n\\nCREATURE Ah, ah, ah!\\n\\nLUKE Oh, Artoo, let him have it!\\n\\nCREATURE Mine! Mine!\\n\\nLUKE Artoo!\\n\\nCREATURE Mine!\\n\\nThe creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one finger. Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.\\n\\nCREATURE Mine!\\n\\nLUKE (fed up) Now will you move along, little fella? We\\'re got a lot of work to do.\\n\\nCREATURE No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. (laughs) Find your friend, hmm?\\n\\nLUKE I\\'m not looking for a friend. I\\'m looking for a Jedi Master.\\n\\nCREATURE Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.\\n\\nLUKE You know him?\\n\\nCREATURE Mmm. Take you to him, I will. (laughs) Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come.\\n\\nWith that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily. Luke stares after him. All he sees is the faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog. Luke makes his decision and starts after the creature.\\n\\nCREATURE (in the distance) Come, come.\\n\\nArtoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.\\n\\nLUKE Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.\\n\\nArtoo beeps even more frantically. But as Luke disappears from view, the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic sigh.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA\\n\\nThreepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in front of him. The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?\\n\\nHan enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, I don\\'t know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to replace it.\\n\\nHAN Well, of course I\\'ll have to replace it.\\n\\nHe hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.\\n\\nHAN Here! And Chewie...\\n\\nChewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and whines. Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so only he can hear.\\n\\nHAN (continuing) ... I think we\\'d better replace the negative power coupling.\\n\\nLeia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve. It doesn\\'t budge. Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her. She rebuffs him.\\n\\nHAN Hey, Your Worship, I\\'m only trying to help.\\n\\nLEIA (still struggling) Would you please stop calling me that?\\n\\nHan hears a new tone in her voice. He watches her pull on the lever.\\n\\nHAN Sure, Leia.\\n\\nLEIA Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.\\n\\nHAN I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I\\'m all right.\\n\\nShe lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.\\n\\nLEIA Occasionally... (a little smile, haltingly) ... when you aren\\'t acting like a scoundrel.\\n\\nHAN (laughs) Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.\\n\\nWith that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.\\n\\nLEIA Stop that.\\n\\nHAN Stop what?\\n\\nLeia is flushes, confused.\\n\\nLEIA Stop that! My hands are dirty.\\n\\nHAN My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?\\n\\nLEIA (looking right into his eyes) Afraid?\\n\\nHan looks at her with a piercing look. He\\'s never looked more handsome, more dashing, more confident. He reaches out slowly and takes Leia\\'s hand again from where it is resting on a console. He draws it toward him.\\n\\nHAN You\\'re trembling.\\n\\nLEIA I\\'m not trembling.\\n\\nThen with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... very slowly.\\n\\nHAN You like me because I\\'m a scoundrel. There aren\\'t enough scoundrels in your life.\\n\\nLeia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.\\n\\nLEIA I happen to like nice men.\\n\\nHAN I\\'m a nice man.\\n\\nLEIA No, you\\'re not. You\\'re...\\n\\nHe kisses her now, with slow, hot lips. He takes his time, as though he had forever, bending her body backward. She has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her faint. When he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk.\\n\\nSuddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, sir! I\\'ve isolated the reverse power flux coupling.\\n\\nHan turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.\\n\\nHAN Thank you. Thank you very much.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, you\\'re perfectly welcome, sir.\\n\\nThe moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD\\n\\nThe Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently seeking its prey.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nAsteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge window. Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control deck. Then slowly turns toward the bridge. Before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship commanders. One of these images, the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly. Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and continually disrupted by static. It is the image of Captain Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the Millennium Falcon. Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark Lord.\\n\\nNEEDA (in hologram) ... and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we\\'ve sustained, they must have been destroyed.\\n\\nVADER No, Captain, they\\'re alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.\\n\\nThe Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to Admiral Piett.\\n\\nPIETT Lord Vader.\\n\\nVADER Yes, Admiral, what is it?\\n\\nThe admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.\\n\\nPIETT The Emperor commands you make contact with him.\\n\\nVADER Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.\\n\\nPIETT Yes, my lord.\\n\\nEXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER\\n\\nVader\\'s Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars away from the rest of the fleet.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER\\'S CHAMBER\\n\\nThe Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber. A strange sound enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader\\'s black figure. He looks up and bows quickly.\\n\\nA twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before Vader. The Emperor\\'s dark robes and monk\\'s hood are reminiscent of the cloak worn by Ben Kenobi. His voice is even deeper and more frightening than Vader\\'s.\\n\\nVADER What is thy bidding, my master?\\n\\nEMPEROR There is a great disturbance in the Force.\\n\\nVADER I have felt it.\\n\\nEMPEROR We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nVADER Yes, my master.\\n\\nEMPEROR He could destroy us.\\n\\nVADER He\\'s just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.\\n\\nEMPEROR The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.\\n\\nVADER If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.\\n\\nEMPEROR Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?\\n\\nVADER He will join us or die, my master.\\n\\nVader kneels. The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord of the Sith and fades away.\\n\\nEXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE\\'S HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nA heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees. A strange baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small lagoon. The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its thick glass windows. As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo\\'s head, the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of the glowing portals.\\n\\nINT. CREATURE\\'S HOUSE\\n\\nArtoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very plain, but cozy dwelling. Everything is in the same small scale as the creature. The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower. He sits cross-legged on the floor of the living room.\\n\\nThe creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up an incredible meal. The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans. The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices. He rushes back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who watches the creature impatiently.\\n\\nLUKE Look, I\\'m sure it\\'s delicious. I just don\\'t understand why we can\\'t see Yoda now.\\n\\nCREATURE Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?\\n\\nMoving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down near the fire and serves himself from the pot. Tasting the unfamiliar concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nLUKE How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?\\n\\nCREATURE Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. (tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?\\n\\nLUKE Mostly because of my father, I guess.\\n\\nCREATURE Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.\\n\\nLUKE (a little angry) Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don\\'t even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing here. We\\'re wasting our time.\\n\\nThe creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.\\n\\nCREATURE (irritated) I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.\\n\\nLuke\\'s head spins in the direction the creature faces. But there is no one there. The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking with Ben.\\n\\nBEN\\'S VOICE He will learn patience.\\n\\nYODA Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.\\n\\nBEN\\'S VOICE Was I any different when you taught me?\\n\\nYODA Hah. He is not ready.\\n\\nLUKE Yoda! I am ready. I... Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I\\'m ready.\\n\\nTrying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low ceiling.\\n\\nYODA Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!\\n\\nLuke looks down. He knows it is true.\\n\\nBEN\\'S VOICE So was I, if you\\'ll remember.\\n\\nYODA He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.\\n\\nLuke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda\\'s voice.\\n\\nLUKE But I\\'ve learned so much.\\n\\nYoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master\\'s huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned. After a long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.\\n\\nYODA (sighs) Will he finished what he begins?\\n\\nLUKE I won\\'t fail you - I\\'m not afraid.\\n\\nYODA (turns slowly toward him) Oh, you will be. You will be.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELD\\n\\nThe Imperial fleet around Vader\\'s ship is surrounded by the asteroid storm. Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing ships. One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.\\n\\nINT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nThe cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the control panel. Princess Leia sits in the pilot\\'s seat.\\n\\nShe runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the confusion he has created within her. Suddenly, something outside the cockpit window catches her eye. The reflection of the panel lights obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the windscreen. Leia moves closer to see what it might be. Large, yellow eyes flash open and stare back at her. Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her heart pounding. There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in an instant the eyes are gone. The young princess catches her breath, jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.\\n\\nINT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA\\n\\nThe lights go bright for a second then out again. Threepio and Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, if I may venture an opinion...\\n\\nHAN I\\'m not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.\\n\\nLeia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into place.\\n\\nLEIA (out of breath) There\\'s something out there.\\n\\nHAN Where?\\n\\nLEIA Outside, in the cave.\\n\\nAs she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull. Chewie looks up and barks anxiously.\\n\\nTHREEPIO There it is. Listen! Listen!\\n\\nHAN I\\'m going out there.\\n\\nLEIA Are you crazy?!\\n\\nHAN I just got this bucket back together. I\\'m not going to let something tear it apart.\\n\\nHe and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out. Leia follows.\\n\\nLEIA Then I\\'m going with you.\\n\\nTHREEPIO I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no.\\n\\nEXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nIt is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is attacking the ship.\\n\\nLeia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.\\n\\nLEIA This ground sure feels strange. It doesn\\'t feel like rock at all.\\n\\nHan kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline of the cave.\\n\\nHAN There\\'s an awful lot of moisture in here.\\n\\nLEIA I don\\'t know. I have a bad feeling about this.\\n\\nHAN Yeah.\\n\\nChewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship\\'s cockpit. A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of the Falcon. The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it with a laser bolt.\\n\\nHAN (to Leia) Watch out!\\n\\nThe black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front of the princess. Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.\\n\\nHAN Yeah, that\\'s what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren\\'t any more attached. They\\'re chewing on the power cables.\\n\\nLEIA Mynocks?\\n\\nHAN Go on inside. We\\'ll clean them off if there are any more.\\n\\nJust then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air. Leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the ship. Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster. Several of the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit window of the Falcon. Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly little thing. Shoo! Shoo!\\n\\nHan looks around the strange, dripping cave.\\n\\nHAN Wait a minute...\\n\\nHe unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave. The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.\\n\\nChewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han. The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their faces and run up the platform.\\n\\nINT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA\\n\\nAs soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch. The ship continues to shake and heave.\\n\\nHAN All right, Chewie, let\\'s get out of here!\\n\\nThe Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel. Leia hurries after.\\n\\nLEIA The Empire is still out there. I don\\'t think it\\'s wise to...\\n\\nHan rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.\\n\\nHAN (interrupting) No time to discuss this in committee.\\n\\nAnd with that he is gone. The main engines of the Falcon begin to whine. Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.\\n\\nLEIA (angry) I am not a committee!\\n\\nINT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nHan is already in the pilot\\'s seat pulling back on the throttle. The cave-quake has greatly diminished.\\n\\nLEIA You can\\'t make the jump to light- speed in this asteroid field...\\n\\nHAN Sit down, sweetheart. We\\'re taking off!\\n\\nAs the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks. He notices something out the window ahead. Threepio sees it too.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Look!\\n\\nHAN I see it, I see it.\\n\\nSuddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen surrounding the entrance. And as the Falcon moves forward, the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller. Han pulls hard on the throttle, sending his ship surging forward.\\n\\nTHREEPIO We\\'re doomed!\\n\\nLEIA The cave is collapsing.\\n\\nHAN This is no cave.\\n\\nLEIA What?\\n\\nLeia\\'s mouth drops open . She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny ship. Chewie howls.\\n\\nINT. SPACE SLUG MOUTH\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster\\'s mouth, rolls on its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth before the huge jaws slams closed.\\n\\nEXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROID\\n\\nThe enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon flies out of its mouth. The monster tilts its head, watching the starship fly away.\\n\\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID\\n\\nThe Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of the asteroid storm.\\n\\nEXT. DAGOBAH - DAY\\n\\nWith Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick vines that grow in the swamp. Panting heavily, he continues his course - climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in and out of the heavy ground fog.\\n\\nYODA Run! Yes. A Jedi\\'s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan\\'s apprentice.\\n\\nLUKE Vader. Is the dark side stronger?\\n\\nYODA No... no... no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.\\n\\nLUKE But how am I to know the good side from the bad?\\n\\nYODA You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.\\n\\nLUKE But tell me why I can\\'t...\\n\\nYODA (interrupting) No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmmmm.\\n\\nArtoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground. Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and pulls it on.\\n\\nHe turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few feet of water. Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on one side. Luke stares at the tree, trembling.\\n\\nLUKE There\\'s something not right here.\\n\\nYoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.\\n\\nLUKE I feel cold, death.\\n\\nYODA That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.\\n\\nLUKE What\\'s in there?\\n\\nYODA Only what you take with you.\\n\\nLuke looks warily between the tree and Yoda. He starts to strap on his weapon belt.\\n\\nYODA Your weapons... you will not need them.\\n\\nLuke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head \"no.\" Yoda shrugs. Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters the tree.\\n\\nINT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVE\\n\\nLuke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave. The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage. Holding his lit saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree. Luke draws a deep breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.\\n\\nThe space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it. His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness. It is very quiet here.\\n\\nThen, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness, illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword. Immediately, he charges Luke, saber held high. He is upon the youth in seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.\\n\\nVader is decapitated. His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness. The metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as Vader\\'s head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks vertically. The black helmet and breath mask fall away to reveal... Luke\\'s head.\\n\\nAcross the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in terror.\\n\\nThe decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.\\n\\nEXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSK\\n\\nMeanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER\\n\\nVader\\'s Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its convoy of TIE fighters.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECK\\n\\nVader stands in the back control area of his ship\\'s bridge with a motley group of men and creatures. Admiral Piett and two controllers stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.\\n\\nPIETT Bounty hunters. We don\\'t need that scum.\\n\\nFIRST CONTROLLER Yes, sir.\\n\\nPIETT Those Rebels won\\'t escape us.\\n\\nA second controller interrupts.\\n\\nSECOND CONTROLLER Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger.\\n\\nPIETT Right.\\n\\nThe group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune hunters There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle- scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.\\n\\nVADER ... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.\\n\\nBOBA FETT As you wish.\\n\\nAt that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.\\n\\nPIETT Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.\\n\\nEXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a firing Imperial Star Destroyer. A large asteroid about the same size as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship. The tiny Falcon banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface. Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nThe ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window. Threepio checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches tensely out the window.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, thank goodness we\\'re coming out of the asteroid field.\\n\\nChewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside. A bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.\\n\\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD\\n\\nThe Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship. The Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nHan corrects the angle of his ship.\\n\\nHAN Let\\'s get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One... two... three!\\n\\nHan pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens. Flak bursts continue to rock the ship.\\n\\nHAN (frantic) It\\'s not fair!\\n\\nChewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and captain. Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.\\n\\nHAN The transfer circuits are working. It\\'s not my fault!\\n\\nChewie puts his head in his hands, whining.\\n\\nLEIA (almost expecting it) No light-speed?\\n\\nHAN It\\'s not my fault.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we\\'re done for.\\n\\nHan pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.\\n\\nHAN Turn her around.\\n\\nChewie barks in puzzlement.\\n\\nHAN I said turn her around! I\\'m going to put all power in the front shield.\\n\\nLEIA You\\'re going to attack them?!\\n\\nTHREEPIO Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...\\n\\nLEIA Shut up!\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD\\n\\nThe Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn. In the next moment it is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the massive surface of the Imperial ship. As it moves across the surface of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous flak bursts.\\n\\nINT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE\\n\\nThe tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger\\'s bridge. The Imperials stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge area. Alarms go off everywhere. The Destroyer\\'s commander, Captain Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.\\n\\nNEEDA They\\'re moving to attack position! Shields up!\\n\\nNeeda and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window. At the last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight. All is quiet.\\n\\nNEEDA Track them. They may come around for another pass.\\n\\nTRACKING OFFICER Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes.\\n\\nNEEDA They can\\'t have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device.\\n\\nTRACKING OFFICER Well, there\\'s no trace of them, sir.\\n\\nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit.\\n\\nNEEDA (drawing a breath) Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.\\n\\nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER Yes, Captain Needa.\\n\\nEXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAY\\n\\nLuke\\'s face is upside-down and showing enormous strain. He stands on his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet. Opposite Luke and Yoda are two rocks the size of bowling balls. Luke stares at the rocks and concentrates. One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to rest on the other.\\n\\nYODA Use the Force. Yes...\\n\\nYoda taps Luke\\'s leg. Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground. His body wavers, but he maintains his balance. Artoo, standing nearby, is whistling and beeping frantically.\\n\\nYODA Now... the stone. Feel it.\\n\\nLuke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock. It rises a few feet, shaking under the strain. But, distracted by Artoo\\'s frantic beeping, Luke loses his balance and finally collapses. Yoda jumps clear.\\n\\nYODA Concentrate!\\n\\nAnnoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking urgently back and forth in front of him.\\n\\nArtoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the edge of the swamp. Catching on, Luke rushes to the water\\'s edge. The X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the lake\\'s surface.\\n\\nLUKE Oh, no. We\\'ll never get it out now.\\n\\nYoda stamps his foot in irritation.\\n\\nYODA So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?\\n\\nLuke looks uncertainly out at the ship.\\n\\nLUKE Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.\\n\\nYODA No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.\\n\\nLUKE (focusing, quietly) All right, I\\'ll give it a try.\\n\\nYODA No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.\\n\\nLuke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.\\n\\nSlowly, the X-wing\\'s nose begins to rise above the water. It hovers for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.\\n\\nLUKE (panting heavily) I can\\'t. It\\'s too big.\\n\\nYODA Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm.\\n\\nLuke shakes his head.\\n\\nYODA And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... (Yoda pinches Luke\\'s shoulder) ... not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!\\n\\nLUKE (discouraged) You want the impossible.\\n\\nQuietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter. With his eyes closed and his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.\\n\\nSoon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo beeps in terror and scoots away.\\n\\nThe entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore. Yoda stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the beach.\\n\\nLuke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore. He walks toward Yoda.\\n\\nLUKE I don\\'t... I don\\'t believe it.\\n\\nYODA That is why you fail.\\n\\nLuke shakes his head, bewildered.\\n\\nEXT.

Two stormtroopers pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.\\n\\nPIETT Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light- speed, it\\'ll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.\\n\\nVADER Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory.\\n\\nPIETT Yes, my lord.

MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nTHREEPIO Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn\\'t anyone listen to me?\\n\\nHAN (to Chewie) The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.\\n\\nChewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.\\n\\nTHREEPIO I really don\\'t see how that is going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...\\n\\nLeia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.\\n\\nHAN Thank you.\\n\\nLEIA What did you have in mind for your next move?\\n\\nHAN Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they\\'ll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.\\n\\nLEIA With the rest of the garbage. Then what?\\n\\nHAN Then we\\'ve got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?\\n\\nLEIA No. Where are we?\\n\\nHAN The Anoat system.\\n\\nLEIA Anoat system. There\\'s not much there.\\n\\nHAN No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.\\n\\nHe points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel. Leia slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot. Small light points representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.\\n\\nLEIA Lando system?\\n\\nHAN Lando\\'s not a system, he\\'s a man. Lando Calrissian. He\\'s a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You\\'d like him.\\n\\nLEIA Thanks.\\n\\nHAN Bespin. It\\'s pretty far, but I think we can make it.\\n\\nLEIA (reading from the computer) A mining colony?\\n\\nHAN Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.\\n\\nLEIA Can you trust him?\\n\\nHAN No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.\\n\\nChewie barks over the intercom. Han quickly changes his readouts and stretches to look out the cockpit window.\\n\\nHAN (into intercom) Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!\\n\\nHan leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile. She thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and she gives him a quick kiss.\\n\\nLEIA You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.\\n\\nEXT.

Hidden among the refuse, the Falcon tumbles away. In the next moment, the Avenger roars off into hyperspace. The Falcon\\'s engines are ignited, and it races off into the distance. Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett\\'s ship appears and moves after the Falcon.\\n\\nEXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY\\n\\nIn the clearing behind Yoda\\'s house, Luke again stands upside-down, but his face shows less strain and more concentration than before. Yoda sits on the ground below the young warrior. On the other side of the clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air. Nearby Artoo watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air. His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, looking for help.\\n\\nYODA Concentrate... feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future... the past. Old friends long gone.\\n\\nLuke suddenly becomes distressed.\\n\\nLUKE Han! Leia!\\n\\nThe two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then Luke himself tumbles over.\\n\\nYODA (shaking his head) Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.\\n\\nLUKE I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.\\n\\nYODA Mmm. Friends you have there.\\n\\nLUKE They were in pain.\\n\\nYODA It is the future you see.\\n\\nLUKE Future? Will they die?\\n\\nYoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.\\n\\nYODA Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.\\n\\nLUKE I\\'ve got to go to them.\\n\\nYODA Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.\\n\\nLuke is stopped cold by Yoda\\'s words. Gloom shrouds him as he nods his head sadly.\\n\\nEXT. BESPIN SYSTEM - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAWN\\n\\nThe powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward the soft pink planet of Bespin.\\n\\nEXT. BESPIN SURFACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nIt is down on the gaseous planet. Huge billowing clouds form a canyon as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system\\'s Cloud City.\\n\\nSuddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon. The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nOne of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak rocking the ship. Chewie barks his concern.\\n\\nHAN (into transmitter) No, I don\\'t have a landing permit. I\\'m trying to reach Lando Calrissian.\\n\\nMore flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship\\'s interior. Leia looks worried.\\n\\nHAN (into transmitter) Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.\\n\\nINTERCOM VOICE You will not deviate from your present course.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Rather touchy, aren\\'t they?\\n\\nLEIA I thought you knew this person.\\n\\nChewie barks and growls at his boss.\\n\\nHAN (to Chewie) Well, that was a long time ago. I\\'m sure he\\'s forgotten about that.\\n\\nINTERCOM VOICE Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.\\n\\nHAN (into transmitter) Thank you.\\n\\nAngry, Han snaps off the intercom. Chewie looks at him and grunts. Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.\\n\\nHAN There\\'s nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.\\n\\nLeia doesn\\'t look convinced.\\n\\nLEIA Who\\'s worried?\\n\\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CARS\\n\\nThe clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out of the cloud surface. The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the gleaming white metropolis.\\n\\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nWith the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the Cloud City\\'s platforms.\\n\\nEXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nHan and Leia stand at the open door, armed. Behind them, Chewie, also armed, surveys the scene warily.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh. No one to meet us.\\n\\nLEIA I don\\'t like this.\\n\\nHAN Well, what would you like?\\n\\nTHREEPIO Well, they did let us land.\\n\\nHAN Look, don\\'t worry. Everything\\'s going to be fine. Trust me.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY\\n\\nLando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a group of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing platform.\\n\\nThe group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection of aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions. Lando has a grim expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform.\\n\\nEXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nHAN See? My friend. (to Chewie) Keep your eyes open, okay?\\n\\nChewie growls as Han walks down the ramp. Lando and his men head across the bridge to meet the space pirate.\\n\\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM\\n\\nLando stops ten feet from Han. The two men eye each other carefully. Lando shakes his head.\\n\\nLANDO Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You\\'ve got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.\\n\\nHan points to himself innocently, mouthing, \"Me?\"\\n\\nLando moves threateningly toward Han. Suddenly, he throws his arms around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.\\n\\nLANDO (laughs) How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I never thought I\\'d catch up with you again. Where you been?\\n\\nThe two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling.\\n\\nEXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Well, he seems very friendly.\\n\\nLEIA (wary) Yes... very friendly.\\n\\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM\\n\\nLANDO What are you doing here?\\n\\nHAN (gestures toward the Falcon) Ahh... repairs. I thought you could help me out.\\n\\nLANDO (in mock panic) What have you done to my ship?\\n\\nHAN Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.\\n\\nChewie growls a reserved greeting. Lando suddenly notices the princess and smiles.\\n\\nLANDO Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I\\'m Lando Calrissian. I\\'m the administrator of this facility. And who might you be?\\n\\nLEIA Leia.\\n\\nLANDO Welcome, Leia.\\n\\nLando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.\\n\\nHAN All right, all right, you old smoothie.\\n\\nHan takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your...\\n\\nBefore Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Well, really!\\n\\nLando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge, followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.\\n\\nLANDO What\\'s wrong with the Falcon?\\n\\nHAN Hyperdrive.\\n\\nLANDO I\\'ll get my people to work on it.\\n\\nHAN Good.\\n\\nLando turns to Leia.\\n\\nLANDO You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She\\'s the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR\\n\\nThe group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city. They walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and passing many small plazas as they go. Threepio lags a bit behind.\\n\\nHAN How\\'s the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?\\n\\nLANDO Oh, not as well as I\\'d like. We\\'re a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I\\'ve had supply problems of every kind. I\\'ve had labor difficulties... (catches Han grinning at him) What\\'s so funny?\\n\\nHAN You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who\\'d have thought that, huh?\\n\\nLando is reflective. He looks at Han a moment.\\n\\nLANDO You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.\\n\\nHAN Yeah.\\n\\nLANDO (shakes his head) Yeah. I\\'m responsible these days. It\\'s the price you pay for being successful.\\n\\nHan and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the corridor.\\n\\nThe lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming out of a door.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.\\n\\nSECOND THREEPIO (mumbles) E chu ta!\\n\\nTHREEPIO How rude!\\n\\nThreepio stops, watching the silver droid move away. Then he hears the muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the room.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM\\n\\nCurious, Threepio enters the room.\\n\\nTHREEPIO That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...\\n\\nThreepio walks through the doorway to the main room. He looks in.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.\\n\\nMAN\\'S VOICE (from within) Who are you?\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, I\\'m terribly sorry. I... I didn\\'t mean to intrude. No, no, please don\\'t get up. No!\\n\\nA laser bolt to Threepio\\'s chest sends him flying in twenty directions. Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door whooshes closed behind him.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR\\n\\nLando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio\\'s dreadful accident. Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.\\n\\nEXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DUSK\\n\\nIn the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the belly of the ship. Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into his cubbyhole. Yoda stands nearby on a log.\\n\\nYODA Luke! You must complete the training.\\n\\nLUKE I can\\'t keep the vision out of my head. They\\'re my friends. I\\'ve got to help them.\\n\\nYODA You must not go!\\n\\nLUKE But Han and Leia will die if I don\\'t.\\n\\nBEN\\'S VOICE You don\\'t know that.\\n\\nLuke looks toward the voice in amazement. Ben has materialized as a real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda. The power of his presence stops Luke.\\n\\nBEN Even Yoda cannot see their fate.\\n\\nLUKE But I can help them! I feel the Force!\\n\\nBEN But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nYODA Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!\\n\\nLUKE But I\\'ve learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I\\'ve begun. You have my word.\\n\\nBEN It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.\\n\\nLUKE And that is why I have to go.\\n\\nBEN Luke, I don\\'t want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.\\n\\nLUKE You won\\'t.\\n\\nYODA Stopped they must be. On this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.\\n\\nBEN Patience.\\n\\nLUKE And sacrifice Han and Leia?\\n\\nYODA If you honor what they fight for ... yes!\\n\\nLuke is in great anguish. He struggles with the dilemma, a battle raging in his mind.\\n\\nBEN If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.\\n\\nLUKE I understand. (he moves to his X-wing) Artoo, fire up the converters.\\n\\nArtoo whistles a happy reply.\\n\\nBEN Luke, don\\'t give in to hate - that leads to the dark side.\\n\\nLuke nods and climbs into his ship.\\n\\nYODA Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.\\n\\nLUKE I will. And I\\'ll return. I promise.\\n\\nArtoo closes the cockpit. Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of the engines and the wind engulf them.\\n\\nYODA (sighs) Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.\\n\\nBEN That boy is our last hope.\\n\\nYODA (looks up) No. There is another.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - PLANET DAGOBAH\\n\\nLuke\\'s tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and off into space.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY\\n\\nWithin the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in agitation. She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a lovely dress. Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons. She moves from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the doorway.\\n\\nHAN The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we\\'re in great shape.\\n\\nLEIA The sooner the better. Something\\'s wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He\\'s been gone too long to have gotten lost.\\n\\nHan takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.\\n\\nHAN Relax. I\\'ll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.\\n\\nLEIA I don\\'t trust Lando.\\n\\nHAN Well, I don\\'t trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we\\'ll soon be gone.\\n\\nLEIA And then you\\'re as good as gone, aren\\'t you?\\n\\nNot speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM\\n\\nThe room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts. Four Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten metal. Pieces of Threepio\\'s golden body move down the belt. Chewie enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting Threepio\\'s head. The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, then reaches to grab the head. But the Ugnaught tosses it away from him to another Ugnaught. This game of keep-away goes on until Threepio\\'s head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the ground.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY\\n\\nThe door zaps open. Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.\\n\\nLEIA What happened?\\n\\nChewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.\\n\\nHAN Where? Found him in a junk pile?\\n\\nLEIA Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?\\n\\nThe giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts. He looks at the princess and shrugs sadly.\\n\\nHAN Lando\\'s got people who can fix him.\\n\\nLEIA No, thanks.\\n\\nThere is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.\\n\\nLANDO I\\'m sorry. Am I interrupting anything?\\n\\nLEIA Not really.\\n\\nLANDO You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.\\n\\nLEIA (coolly) Thank you.\\n\\nLANDO Will you join me for a little refreshment?\\n\\nHan looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of food and licks his lips.\\n\\nLANDO Everyone\\'s invited, of course.\\n\\nLeia takes Lando\\'s proffered arm, and the group turns to go. Lando spots Threepio\\'s remains.\\n\\nLANDO Having trouble with you droid?\\n\\nHan and Leia exchange a quick glance.\\n\\nHAN No. No problem. Why?\\n\\nHan and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and Chewie. The door slides closed behind them.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY\\n\\nLeia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance behind. Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, pure-white columns.\\n\\nLANDO So you see, since we\\'re a small operation, we don\\'t fall into the... uh... jurisdiction of the Empire.\\n\\nLEIA So you\\'re part of the mining guild then?\\n\\nLANDO No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.\\n\\nThe group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at the far end.\\n\\nHAN Aren\\'t you afraid the Empire\\'s going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?\\n\\nLANDO That\\'s always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we\\'ve built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I\\'ve just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM\\n\\nThe mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the dining room. At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader. Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty hunter.\\n\\nFaster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a couple of shots directly at Vader. The Dark Lord quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they explode harmlessly. Just as quickly, Han\\'s weapon zips into Vader\\'s hand. The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of him.\\n\\nVADER We would be honored if you would join us.\\n\\nHan gives Lando a mean look.\\n\\nLANDO I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I\\'m sorry. HAN I\\'m sorry, too.\\n\\nEXT. LUKE\\'S X-WING - BESPIN SYSTEM\\n\\nLuke\\'s X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.\\n\\nINT. LUKE\\'S X-WING - COCKPIT\\n\\nLuke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin\\'s shining city. Artoo\\'s beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) No, Threepio\\'s with them.\\n\\nArtoo whistles another worried inquiry.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) Just hang on. We\\'re almost there.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL\\n\\nChewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell. The stark room is flooded with hot light. To add to Chewie\\'s misery, a high-pitched whistle screeches loudly. Chewie is going mad. He hits the wall with giant fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor. The upper lights go off abruptly. The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a wall, where he listens for a moment. Then, moaning to himself, he moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie. He picks up the golden droid\\'s head and meditates on it for a moment, barking a few philosophical remarks. Chewie sticks the robot\\'s head on its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.\\n\\nSuddenly, the lights in Threepio\\'s eyes spark to life as Chewie touches two connectors together. Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don\\'t mean to intrude here. I, don\\'t, no, no, no... Please don\\'t get up. No!\\n\\nChewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry head. He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio immediately begins speaking normally.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Stormtroopers? Here? We\\'re in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I\\'ve been shot!\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA\\n\\nDarth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an elaborate torture mechanism. Han is strapped to a rack which tilts forward onto the torture device. Vader activates the mechanism, creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han\\'s face.\\n\\nThe door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a sharp, piercing cry of agony. Darth Vader moves to the holding chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBER\\n\\nLANDO Lord Vader.\\n\\nVADER (to Fett) You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.\\n\\nHan\\'s screams filter through the torture room door.\\n\\nBOBA FETT He\\'s no good to me dead.\\n\\nVADER He will not be permanently damaged.\\n\\nLANDO Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?\\n\\nVADER They must never again leave this city.\\n\\nLANDO That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!\\n\\nVADER Perhaps you think you\\'re being treated unfairly.\\n\\nLANDO No.\\n\\nVADER Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.\\n\\nVader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett. Lando walks swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.\\n\\nLANDO This deal\\'s getting worse all the time.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL\\n\\nChewie now has a little more of Threepio back together. One arm is connected, but the legs are yet to be attached. There is one small problem, however. It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid\\'s head on backwards.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, yes, that\\'s very good. I like that. Oh! Something\\'s not right because now I can\\'t see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I\\'m backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...\\n\\nThreepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a circuit and the droid shuts down. The Wookiee smells something and sits up. The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is shoved into the room by two stormtroopers. Barking his concern, the huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug. Han is very pale, with dark circles under his eyes.\\n\\nHAN I feel terrible.\\n\\nChewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open revealing Leia. She, too, looks a little worse for wear. The troopers push her into the cell, and the door slides closed. She moves to Han, who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking his head.\\n\\nLEIA Why are they doing this?\\n\\nHAN They never even asked me any questions.\\n\\nThe cell door slides open. Lando and two of his guards enter.\\n\\nLEIA Lando.\\n\\nHAN Get out of here, Lando!\\n\\nLANDO Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.\\n\\nHAN Over to you?\\n\\nLANDO They\\'ll have to stay here, but at least they\\'ll be safe.\\n\\nLEIA What about Han?\\n\\nLANDO Vader\\'s giving him to the bounty hunter.\\n\\nLEIA Vader wants us all dead.\\n\\nLANDO He doesn\\'t want you at all. He\\'s after somebody called Skywalker.\\n\\nHAN Luke?\\n\\nLANDO Lord Vader has set a trap for him.\\n\\nLeia\\'s mind is racing.\\n\\nLEIA And we\\'re the bait.\\n\\nLANDO Well, he\\'s on his way.\\n\\nHan\\'s rage peaks.\\n\\nHAN Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn\\'t you? (spits it out) My friend!\\n\\nHan hauls off and punches Lando. The two friends are instantly engaged in a frantic close-quarters fight. The guards hit Han with their rifle butts and he flies across the room. Chewie growls and starts for the guards. They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando stops them.\\n\\nLANDO Stop! I\\'ve done all I can. I\\'m sorry I couldn\\'t do better, but I have my own problems.\\n\\nHAN Yeah, you\\'re a real hero.\\n\\nLando and the guards leave. Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia and Chewie help him up.\\n\\nLEIA (dabs at his wound) You certainly have a way with people.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\\n\\nFour armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks. In the middle of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform. Darth Vader and Lando stand near the platform.\\n\\nVADER This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.\\n\\nAn Imperial soldier appears.\\n\\nIMPERIAL SOLDIER Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.\\n\\nVADER Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.\\n\\nThe soldier bows and leaves the chamber.\\n\\nLANDO Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him.\\n\\nVADER I do not want the Emperor\\'s prize damaged. We will test it... on Captain Solo.\\n\\nLando\\'s face registers dismay.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM - LUKE\\'S X-WING\\n\\nLuke\\'s X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.\\n\\nINT. LUKE\\'S X-WING - COCKPIT\\n\\nEncountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\\n\\nThere is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform. Six Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use. A special coffinlike container is put in place. With Boba Fett in the lead, a squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie. Strapped to Chewie\\'s back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is Threepio. Threepio\\'s head faces the opposite direction from Chewie\\'s and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see what is happening. His one attached arm is animate and expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes. The remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee\\'s back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.\\n\\nTHREEPIO If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn\\'t be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don\\'t do anything foolish.\\n\\nHAN (to Lando) What\\'s going on... buddy?\\n\\nLANDO You\\'re being put into carbon freeze.\\n\\nBoba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.\\n\\nBOBA FETT What if he doesn\\'t survive? He\\'s worth a lot to me.\\n\\nVADER The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!\\n\\nRealizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han. Within seconds, other Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee with their laser weapons.\\n\\nFrom the instant of Chewie\\'s first move, Threepio begins to scream in panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!\\n\\nThe stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.\\n\\nHAN Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!\\n\\nTHREEPIO Yes, stop, please! I\\'m not ready to die.\\n\\nHan breaks away from his captors. Vader nods to the guards to let him go and the pirate breaks up the fight.\\n\\nHAN Chewie! Chewie, this won\\'t help me. Hey!\\n\\nHan gives the Wookiee a stern look.\\n\\nHAN Save your strength. There\\'ll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me?\\n\\nHan winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.\\n\\nIn a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too distraught to protest. Han turns to Princess Leia. They look sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a final, passionate kiss.\\n\\nLEIA I love you!\\n\\nHAN I know.\\n\\nTears roll down Leia\\'s face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to the hydraulic platform. Han looks one final time at his friends - and then, suddenly, the platform drops. Chewie howls. Leia turns away in agony.\\n\\nLando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.\\n\\nInstantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace. Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.\\n\\nTHREEPIO What... what\\'s going on? Turn round, Chewbacca, I can\\'t see. Oh... they\\'ve encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is.\\n\\nChewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an angry glance and bark.\\n\\nA huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate out of the vat and stands him on the platform. Some Ugnaughts rush over and push the block over onto the platform. They slide the coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it inside. They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step away. Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat. He shakes his head in relief.\\n\\nVADER Well, Calrissian, did he survive?\\n\\nLANDO Yes, he\\'s alive. And in perfect hibernation.\\n\\nVader turns to Boba Fett.\\n\\nVADER He\\'s all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.\\n\\nIMPERIAL OFFICER Skywalker has just landed, my lord.\\n\\nVADER Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.\\n\\nLANDO You said they\\'d be left in the city under my supervision.\\n\\nVADER I am altering the deal. Pray I don\\'t alter it any further.\\n\\nLando\\'s hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia, Chewie, and Threepio.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY\\n\\nAs Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a group of people coming down a side hallway. Artoo lets out an excited series of beeps and whistles. Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops in his tracks with a feeble squeak.\\n\\nBoba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the floating, encased body of Han Solo. Two stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot Luke and open fire on him. The youth draws his weapon and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot. The two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a huge chunk of wall.\\n\\nLuke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, Han, and the guards are gone. A think metal door blocks the passage. Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a second hallway by several other stormtroopers. Leia turns just in time to see Luke.\\n\\nLEIA Luke! Luke, don\\'t - it\\'s a trap! It\\'s a trap!\\n\\nBefore she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears from sight. Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing behind.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM\\n\\nLuke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings. Leia and the others are nowhere to be seen. Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes slamming down, cutting off Luke\\'s exit. Several more doors clang shut, echoing through the chamber.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM\\n\\nArtoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door. He whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the other direction.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM\\n\\nLuke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam. Seeing an opening above him, he stops to look up. As he does, the platform he stands on begins to move.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\\n\\nLuke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform. The room is deathly quiet. Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else seems to be in the large room. Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.\\n\\nSteam begins to build up in the chamber. Looking up through the steam, Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him. Luke holsters his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader. He feels confident, eager to engage his enemy.\\n\\nVADER The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet.\\n\\nLuke ignites his sword in answer. In an instant, Vader\\'s own sword is lit. Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow. Again Luke attacks, and the swords of the two combatants clash in battle.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR\\n\\nLeia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, guarded by six stormtroopers. The group reaches an intersection where Lobot and a dozen of Lando\\'s guards stand at attention.\\n\\nThe guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers. Taking the stormtroopers\\' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia and one to Lando.\\n\\nLANDO Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move.\\n\\nAs Lando\\'s guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to undo Chewie\\'s binding.\\n\\nLEIA What do you think you\\'re doing?\\n\\nLANDO We\\'re getting out of here.\\n\\nTHREEPIO I knew all along it had to be a mistake.\\n\\nChewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.\\n\\nLEIA Do you think that after what you did to Han we\\'re going to trust you?\\n\\nLando tries to free himself from Chewie.\\n\\nLANDO (choking) I had no choice...\\n\\nChewie barks ferociously.\\n\\nTHREEPIO (to Chewie) What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!\\n\\nLEIA Oh, so we understand, don\\'t we, Chewie? He had no choice.\\n\\nLANDO I\\'m just trying to help...\\n\\nLEIA We don\\'t need any of your help.\\n\\nLANDO (choking) H-a-a-a...\\n\\nLEIA What?\\n\\nTHREEPIO It sounds like Han.\\n\\nLANDO There\\'s still a chance to save Han... I mean, at the East Platform...\\n\\nLEIA Chewie.\\n\\nChewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.\\n\\nTHREEPIO (to Lando) I\\'m terribly sorry about all this. After all, he\\'s only a Wookiee.\\n\\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT\\'S SHIP\\n\\nThe two guards slide Han\\'s encased body into an opening in the side of the bounty hunter\\'s ship. Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to the cargo hold.\\n\\nBOBA FETT Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.\\n\\nAnd with that, the door slams shut.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR\\n\\nLando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?\\n\\nChewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be spun out of sight of his friend.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Turn around, you wooly...! (to Artoo) Hurry, hurry! We\\'re trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!\\n\\nWhistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing group.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me!\\n\\nEXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY\\n\\nAn elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.\\n\\nJust as they arrive, Boba Fett\\'s ship takes off against a cloudy sunset sky.\\n\\nIn wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, no! Chewie, they\\'re behind you!\\n\\nA laser bolt explodes near the princess. Everyone turns to see what Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them. Artoo peeks out from the elevator.\\n\\nLeia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break for the elevator. Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge. Lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice. They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.\\n\\nBut after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator. Once they are inside, the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER\\n\\nLuke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the chamber. Their swords clash, the platform sways. Luke aggressively drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.\\n\\nVADER You have learned much, young one.\\n\\nLUKE You\\'ll find I\\'m full of surprises.\\n\\nVader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke\\'s sword out of his hand and sending it flying. Another lightning move at Luke\\'s feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself. Losing his balance, Luke rolls down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform. There he sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken. Just in time he looks up to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him. Luke rolls away as Vader lands. Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his enemy.\\n\\nVADER Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.\\n\\nLUKE No!\\n\\nBehind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly. All the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.\\n\\nSuddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and falls back into the opening. There is a rumble, and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure Vader\\'s vision. Vader turns aside and deactivates his sword.\\n\\nVADER All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought.\\n\\nThrough the steam behind Vader something blurs upward. Liquid metal begins to pour into the pit.\\n\\nVader turns around - and then looks up. He sees Luke, who has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the carbonite outlet.\\n\\nVADER Impressive... most impressive.\\n\\nLuke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the steaming carbonite pit. He raises his hand. His sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly ignited. Vader immediately lights his sword as well.\\n\\nVADER Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger.\\n\\nLuke is more cautious, controlling his anger. He begins to retreat as Vader goads him on. As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he has been foolhardy. A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back. Another exchange and Vader retreats. Luke presses forward.\\n\\nVADER Only your hatred can destroy me.\\n\\nBreathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader. He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to fill up with steam.\\n\\nVader retreats before Luke\\'s skillful sword. Vader blocks the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes. The energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of collapse. Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of Vader. He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM\\n\\nMoving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the reactor room. He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as Vader enters.\\n\\nLuke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.\\n\\nBehind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back. Luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him. Using the Force, Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield.\\n\\nA large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke. He deflects it. Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth. Small tools and equipment come flying at him. Bombardment from all sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised. Finally, one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window. A fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.\\n\\nA piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.\\n\\nINT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT\\n\\nLuke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his deactivated sword in hand. He puts the sword on his belt and begins to scramble up.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM\\n\\nLeia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the door to the landing platform. They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a moment before the door slams shut. The group ducks into an alcove as stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor. The troopers send a rain of laser bolts at the group. Chewie returns their fire as Lando punches desperately at the door\\'s control panel.\\n\\nLANDO The security codes has been changed!\\n\\nTHREEPIO Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system.\\n\\nThreepio points to a computer socket on the control panel. Artoo beeps and scoots toward it. Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel\\'s intercom.\\n\\nLANDO Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.\\n\\nArtoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the socket. Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream. Artoo\\'s circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out underneath him. Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.\\n\\nLANDO This way.\\n\\nLando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor. As he scoots along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio\\'s way.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Don\\'t blame me. I\\'m an interpreter. I\\'m not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.\\n\\nINT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR\\n\\nIn a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city. Some carry boxes, others packages. They run, then change direction. Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.\\n\\nOther stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back at them. Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.\\n\\nTHREEPIO What are you talking about? We\\'re not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It\\'s fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.\\n\\nChewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor. A triumphant beep from Artoo - and the door snaps open.\\n\\nTHREEPIO (to Artoo) I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!\\n\\nArtoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes outside.\\n\\nEXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK\\n\\nThey race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers reaches the main door. Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the droids get on board with Chewie. As Chewie bounds to the ship the Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt. Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!\\n\\nChewie starts up the ship. The giant engines begin to whine as Lando and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.\\n\\nLANDO Leia! Go!\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR\\n\\nArtoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the Falcon.\\n\\nTHREEPIO I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I\\'ve looked better.\\n\\nArtoo beeps understandingly.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nChewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han\\'s seat and Lando watches over their shoulders. As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship begins to move.\\n\\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars away from the city. Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in pursuit.\\n\\nINT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT\\n\\nLuke moves along the railing and up to the control room.\\n\\nVader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet Vader\\'s. Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke backward toward the gantry.\\n\\nVADER You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don\\'t let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.\\n\\nLuke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder. The black armor sparks and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.\\n\\nLuke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword. Luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry. Vader\\'s sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.\\n\\nLuke glances at the instrument complex floating away. At that instant, Vader\\'s sword comes down across Luke\\'s right forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying. In great pain, Luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end. Vader follows. The wind subsides. Luke holds on. There is nowhere else to go.\\n\\nVADER There is no escape. Don\\'t make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.\\n\\nLUKE I\\'ll never join you!\\n\\nVADER If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.\\n\\nLUKE He told me enough! It was you who killed him.\\n\\nVADER No. I am your father.\\n\\nShocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.\\n\\nLUKE No. No. That\\'s not true! That\\'s impossible!\\n\\nVADER Search your feelings. You know it to be true.\\n\\nLUKE No! No! No!\\n\\nVADER Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It is the only way.\\n\\nVader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.\\n\\nA calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision. In the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space. The Dark Lord looks over the platform and sees Luke falling far below. The wind begins to blow at Vader\\'s cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge. The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.\\n\\nINT. REACTOR SHAFT\\n\\nSuddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft. When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.\\n\\nINT. EXHAUST PIPE\\n\\nLuke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.\\n\\nHe slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet hit a circular grill and knock it open. Luke claws at the surface of the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.\\n\\nEXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK\\n\\nUnable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the undermost part of Cloud City. Reaching out desperately, he manages to grab onto on electronic weather vane.\\n\\nLUKE Ben... Ben, please!\\n\\nLuke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down. He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments. All the while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust pipe.\\n\\nLUKE Ben. Leia!\\n\\nThere is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.\\n\\nLUKE Hear me! Leia!\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLeia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled. Chewie is busy operating the ship. Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a readout on the control panel.\\n\\nLEIA Luke... We\\'ve got to go back.\\n\\nChewie growls in surprise.\\n\\nLANDO What?\\n\\nLEIA I know where Luke is.\\n\\nLANDO But what about those fighter?\\n\\nChewie barks in agreement with Lando.\\n\\nLEIA Chewie, just do it.\\n\\nLANDO But what about Vader?\\n\\nChewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.\\n\\nLANDO All right, all right, all right.\\n\\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK\\n\\nThe Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.\\n\\nEXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM\\n\\nVader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the Falcon disappears. The wind blows at his cape.\\n\\nHe turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing platform.\\n\\nVADER Bring my shuttle.\\n\\nEXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE\\n\\nNearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his body shifts in the wind.\\n\\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY\\n\\nThe Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city. Three TIE fighter close in on the starship.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nLeia tries to remain calm.\\n\\nLANDO (pointing out the cockpit window) Look, someone\\'s up there.\\n\\nLEIA It\\'s Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we\\'ll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch.\\n\\nLando rushes out of the cockpit.\\n\\nEXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE\\n\\nLuke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane. He slips from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks toward him. The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up through the opening of the hatch. Luke begins to slide and finally falls from the vane into space.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nOut the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the city. The ship gains on him.\\n\\nLEIA Okay. Easy, Chewie.\\n\\nThe Falcon closes in on Luke.\\n\\nEXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY\\n\\nThree TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH\\n\\nThe hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure. Lando reaches out to help the battered warrior inside the ship.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nFlak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city. Leia and Chewie struggle with the controls.\\n\\nLEIA (into intercom) Lando?\\n\\nLANDO (over intercom) Okay, let\\'s go.\\n\\nEXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY\\n\\nThe Falcon races away. It is closely followed by three TIE fighters, all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nExplosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly. Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.\\n\\nLeia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the cockpit supported by Lando. Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie barks in joyous relief.\\n\\nLUKE Oh, Leia.\\n\\nLANDO All right, Chewie. Let\\'s go.\\n\\nLeia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - DAY\\n\\nThe Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from the cloud-covered city.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS\\n\\nLuke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff. Leia gently wipes his face. The ship lurches again.\\n\\nLEIA I\\'ll be back.\\n\\nShe kisses him, then leaves the quarters.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nAll over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound. Lando anxiously watches the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some switches. Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing on the panel. Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the shape.\\n\\nLEIA Star Destroyer.\\n\\nLANDO All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.\\n\\nLEIA If your people fixed the hyperdrive.\\n\\nAnother explosion rocks the ship. Leia notices as a green light on the panel next to her flashes on.\\n\\nLEIA All the coordinates are set. It\\'s now or never.\\n\\nChewie barks in agreement.\\n\\nLANDO Punch it!\\n\\nThe Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle. The sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up. Faces are tense, expectant. But nothing happens, and the engine goes off. Chewie lets out a frustrated howl. The flak still violently rocks the ship.\\n\\nLANDO They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It\\'s not my fault!\\n\\nChewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit. He gives Lando and angry shove as he storms past him.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE\\n\\nIn the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase, still shooting lasers. Vader\\'s Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly following the Falcon.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nVader stands on the bridge looking out the window as Admiral Piett approaches him.\\n\\nPIETT They\\'ll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, my lord.\\n\\nVADER Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?\\n\\nPIETT Yes, my lord.\\n\\nVADER Good. Prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun.\\n\\nPIETT Yes, my lord.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON\\n\\nBeeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires to Threepio who now has one leg attached.\\n\\nChewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Noisy brute. Why don\\'t we just go into light-speed?\\n\\nArtoo beeps in response.\\n\\nTHREEPIO We can\\'t? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?\\n\\nArtoo whistles knowingly.\\n\\nTHREEPIO The city\\'s central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you\\'re doing!\\n\\nChewie is in the pit. He is trying to loosen something with an enormous wrench. Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits the panel...\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLeia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly sprayed by a shower of sparks.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nVader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium Falcon is chased by the TIE fighters. As his Destroyer draws nearer, Vader\\'s breathing gets slightly faster.\\n\\nVADER Luke.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS\\n\\nLuke realizes that Vader\\'s ship is very near. He feels resigned to his fate. He senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically.\\n\\nLUKE Father.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nVADER Son, come with me.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS\\n\\nLUKE (moaning) Ben, why didn\\'t you tell me?\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon. Meanwhile, in the ship\\'s hold, Chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive mechanism.\\n\\nLANDO (into intercom) Chewie!\\n\\nEXT. SPACE\\n\\nThe Falcon races through space followed very closely by the TIE fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLuke enters the cockpit and looks out the window. He is almost unconscious with pain and depression.\\n\\nLUKE It\\'s Vader.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nVADER Luke... it is your destiny.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLUKE Ben, why didn\\'t you tell me?\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nPIETT Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD\\n\\nArtoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board. Furious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Artoo, come back at once! You haven\\'t finished with me yet! You don\\'t know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I\\'m standing here in pieces, and you\\'re having delusions of grandeur!\\n\\nArtoo moves a circuit on a control panel. Suddenly, the control panel lights up.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLeia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the Millennium Falcon unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD\\n\\nThe ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of Chewie.\\n\\nTHREEPIO Oh, you did it!\\n\\nEXT. SPACE\\n\\nThe Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer which seems, by contrast, to stand still.\\n\\nINT. VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nAdmiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in terror. Vader turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back in a contemplative gesture.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - REBEL CRUISER\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking tube. Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel transport ship hovers near the fleet.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLando sits in the pilot\\'s seat as he talks into the comlink. Chewie busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff.\\n\\nLANDO (into comlink) Luke, we\\'re ready for takeoff.\\n\\nLUKE (over comlink) Good luck, Lando\\n\\nLANDO (into comlink) When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we\\'ll contact you.\\n\\nINT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER\\n\\nLuke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand. Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) I\\'ll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.\\n\\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLANDO (into comlink) Princess, we\\'ll find Han. I promise.\\n\\nINT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) Chewie, I\\'ll be waiting for your signal.\\n\\nChewie\\'s wail comes over the comlink.\\n\\nLUKE (into comlink) Take care, you two. May the Force be with you.\\n\\nLuke looks down at his hand. A metalized type of bandage has been wrapped around his wrist. The medical droid makes some adjustments in a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke\\'s fingers.\\n\\nLUKE Ow!\\n\\nLuke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it. His hand is completely functional.\\n\\nHe gets up and walks over to Leia. There is a new bond between them, a new understanding. Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about his uncertain and newly complicated future. Together they stand at the large window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star Cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space.\\n\\nLuke puts his arm around Leia. The droids stand next to them, and Threepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him. The group watches as the Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and zooms away into space.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE - REBEL STAR CRUISER\\n\\nWhile Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship.

War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup\\nslowly crawls into infinity.\\n\\n\\nLuke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.\\n\\nLittle does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star.\\n\\nWhen completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...\\n\\n\\nPAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its\\nmassive superstructure curling away from the completed section\\nlike the arms of a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast,\\nfloats the small, green moon of ENDOR.\\n\\nAn Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive\\narmored space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A\\nsmall Imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and\\nhustles toward the Death Star.\\n\\n=== INTERIOR: IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT ===\\n\\nThe shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.\\n\\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN: Command station, this is ST 321. Code\\nClearance Blue. We\\'re starting our approach. Deactivate\\nthe security shield.\\n\\nDEATH STAR CONTROLLER: (filtered VO) The security deflector\\nshield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your\\ncode transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed.\\n\\nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN: We\\'re starting our approach.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\\n\\nOperators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR\\nhits switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the\\nDeath Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the\\ninvisible deflector shield.\\n\\nA control officer rushes over to the shield operator.\\n\\nOFFICER: Inform the commander that Lord Vader\\'s\\nshuttle has arrived.\\n\\nOPERATOR: Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe control officer moves to a view port and watches as the\\nImperial shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of\\nImperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\\n\\nThe DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident\\ntechnocrat, strides through the assembled troops to the base of\\nthe shuttle ramp. The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy\\nabout the new arrival. But the Death Star commander stands\\narrogantly tall.\\n\\nThe exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only\\ndarkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From\\nthis black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader\\nlooks over the assemblage as he walks down the ramp.\\n\\nJERJERROD: Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.\\nWe\\'re honored by your presence.\\n\\nVADER: You may dispense with the pleasantries,\\nCommander. I\\'m here to put you back on schedule.\\n\\nThe commander turns ashen and begins to shake.\\n\\nJERJERROD: I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working\\nas fast as they can.\\n\\nVADER: Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate\\nthem.\\n\\nJERJERROD: I tell you, this station will be operational\\nas planned.\\n\\nVADER: The Emperor does not share your optimistic\\nappraisal of the situation.\\n\\nJERJERROD: But he asks the impossible. I need more men.\\n\\nVADER: Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.\\n\\nJERJERROD: (aghast) The Emperor\\'s coming here?\\n\\nVADER: That is correct, Commander. And he is most\\ndispleased with your apparent lack of progress.\\n\\nJERJERROD: We shall double our efforts.\\n\\nVADER: I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The\\nEmperor is not as forgiving as I am.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: ROAD TO JABBA\\'S PALACE - TATOOINE\\n\\nA lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine\\nterrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply\\nbefore catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making\\ntheir way along the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the\\nHutt.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Of course I\\'m worried. And you should be, too.\\nLando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from\\nthis awful place.\\n\\nArtoo whistles timidly.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Don\\'t be so sure. If I told you half the things\\nI\\'ve heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You\\'d probably\\nshort-circuit.\\n\\nThe two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo, are you sure this is the right place?\\nI better knock, I suppose.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: JABBA\\'S PALACE - GATE\\n\\nThreepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then\\ntimidly knocks on the iron door.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: (instantly) There doesn\\'t seem to be anyone\\nthere. Let\\'s go back and tell Master Luke.\\n\\nA small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery\\nmechanical arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops\\nout and inspects the two droids.\\n\\nSTRANGE VOICE: Tee chuta hhat yudd!\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Goodness gracious me!\\n\\nThreepio points to Artoo, then to himself.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd\\nmischka Jabba du Hutt.\\n\\nThe eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then\\nthe eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo\\nbeeps his concern.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I don\\'t think they\\'re going to let us in,\\nArtoo. We\\'d better go.\\n\\nArtoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly\\nthe massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH.\\nThe robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids\\nlook at one another, afraid to enter.\\n\\nArtoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his\\nstubby companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really\\ndon\\'t think we should rush into all this.\\n\\nArtoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!\\n\\nINTERIOR: JABBA\\'S PALACE - HALLWAY\\n\\nThe door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the\\ndark passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant,\\ngreen GAMORREAN GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances\\nquickly back at the two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One\\nguard grunts an order. Artoo beeps nervously.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Just you deliver Master Luke\\'s message and\\nget us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.\\n\\nWalking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a\\nhumanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.\\n\\nBIB: Die Wanna Wanga!\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a\\nmessage to your master, Jabba the Hutt.\\n\\nArtoo lets out a series of quick beeps.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: (cont) ...and a gift. (thinks a moment, then\\nto Artoo) Gift, what gift?\\n\\nBib shakes his head negatively.\\n\\nBIB: Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.\\n\\nBib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a\\nbit, letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to\\nthe strange-looking alien.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: He says that our instructions are to give it\\nonly to Jabba himself.\\n\\nBib thinks about this for a moment.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I\\'m terribly sorry. I\\'m afraid he\\'s ever so\\nstubborn about these sort of things.\\n\\nBib gestures for the droids to follow.\\n\\nBIB: Nudd Chaa.\\n\\nThe droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness,\\ntrailed by the two guards.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.\\n\\nINTERIOR: JABBA\\'S THRONE ROOM\\n\\nThe throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque\\nCREATURES ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem\\nvery small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber.\\nLight shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib\\nFortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the\\nleader of this nauseating crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of\\nthe galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a\\nmaniacal grin. Chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful\\nalien female dancer named OOLA. At the foot of the dais sits an\\nobnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS CRUMB. Bib whispers\\nsomething in the slobbering degenerate\\'s ear. Jabba laughs\\nhorribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows\\npolitely.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Good morning.\\n\\nJABBA: Bo Shuda!\\n\\nThe robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-\\nskinned villain.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: The message, Artoo, the message.\\n\\nArtoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head,\\ncreating a HOLOGRAM of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over\\nten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space\\ngangsters.\\n\\nLUKE: Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce\\nmyself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend\\nto Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty\\nJabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally\\npowerful. I seek anaudience with Your Greatness to\\nbargain for Solo\\'s life. (Jabba\\'s crowd laughs) With\\nyour wisdom, I\\'m sure that we can work out an\\narrangement which will be mutually beneficial and\\nenable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a\\ntoken of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these\\ntwo droids.\\n\\nThreepio is startled by this announcement.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: What did he say?\\n\\nLUKE: (cont) ...Both are hardworking and will serve you\\nwell.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: This can\\'t be! Artoo, you\\'re playing the\\nwrong message.\\n\\nLuke\\'s hologram disappears.\\n\\nJabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) There will be no bargain.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: We\\'re doomed.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) I will not give up my\\nfavorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.\\n\\nJabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the\\nthrone. Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw\\nhim last, is a carbonized HAN SOLO.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he\\'s still\\nfrozen in carbonite.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DUNGEON CORRIDOR\\n\\nOne of Jabba\\'s Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a\\ndank, shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of\\nunspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls.\\nOccasionally a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the bars\\nat the hapless droids. Artoo beeps pitifully.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: What could possibly have come over Master\\nLuke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any\\nunhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!\\n\\nA large tentacle wraps around Threepio\\'s neck. He manages to\\nbreak free, and they move on to a door at the end of the\\ncorridor.\\n\\nINTERIOR: BOILER ROOM\\n\\nThe door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and\\nnoisy machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room,\\nwhere they are met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9\\n(EVE-NINEDENINE). Behind the robot can be seen a torture rack\\npulling the legs off a screaming baby work droid. A second\\npower droid is upside down. As smoking branding irons are\\npressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized\\nelectronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts\\nto EV-9D9.\\n\\nNINEDENINE: Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a\\nprotocol droid, are you not?\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I am See-Threepio, human-cy...\\n\\nNINEDENINE: Yes or no will do.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh. Well, yes.\\n\\nNINEDENINE: How many languages do you speak?\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I am fluent in over six million forms of\\ncommunication, and can readily...\\n\\nNINEDENINE: Splendid! We have been without an interpreter\\nsince our master got angry with our last protocol droid\\nand disintegrated him.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Disintegrated?\\n\\nNINEDENINE: (to a Gamorrean guard) Guard! This protocol\\ndroid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt\\nand take him back to His Excellency\\'s main audience\\nchamber.\\n\\nThe guard shoves Threepio toward the door.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: (disappearing) Artoo, don\\'t leave me! Ohhh!\\n\\nArtoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps\\nangrily.\\n\\nNINEDENINE: You\\'re a feisty little one, but you\\'ll soon\\nlearn some respect. I have need for you on the master\\'s\\nSail Barge. And I think you\\'ll fit in nicely.\\n\\nThe poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured\\nelectronic scream.\\n\\nINTERIOR: JABBA\\'S THRONE ROOM\\n\\nThe court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous\\nparty. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola\\nand a fat, six-breasted female dancer perform in front of Jabba\\'s\\nthrone. Jabba\\'s alien band plays a wildly rhythmic tune on reeds,\\ndrums, and other exotic instruments. The Hutt rocks and swings in\\ntime with the music and toys with Oola\\'s leash. The song comes to a\\nclose and the audience applauds.\\n\\nJABBA: Ah! Do that again!\\n\\nBAND MEMBERS: One, two, three! Go, daddy, go! One, two,\\nthree!\\n\\nThe music swells. Oola and the fat female dancer perform as the alien\\nband rocks. Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in\\nhis eye beckons Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and\\nbacks away, shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot\\nnext to him. Oola continues to protest and pull back against the tout\\nleash.\\n\\nJABBA: Da Eitha!\\n\\nThe lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.\\n\\nOOLA: Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...\\n\\nJabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.\\n\\nJABBA: Boscka!\\n\\nHe pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door\\nin the floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps\\nshut, a muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and\\nhis monstrous friends laugh hysterically and several revelers\\nhurry over to watch her fate through a grate. Oola tumbles down a\\nchute and sprawls on the floor of the Rancor cage.\\n\\nThreepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of\\nHan Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.\\nAn unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far\\nside of the room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow\\nthe approach of two guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked\\nbounty hunter, leading his captive, Han Solo\\'s copilot, CHEWBACCA\\nTHE WOOKIEE.\\n\\nBib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers\\ninto his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba\\nlistens intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster\\nand speaks a greeting in a strange, electronically processed\\ntongue (Ubese).\\n\\nBOUSHH: (in Ubese subtitled) I have come for the\\nbounty on this Wookiee.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, no! Chewbacca!\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) At last we have the\\nmighty Chewbacca.\\n\\nJabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to\\nThreepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your\\nWorshipfulness. Uh... yes!\\n\\nJabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates.\\nBoushh listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room.\\nHe notices BOBA FETT standing near the door.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome\\nand will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five\\nthousand.\\n\\nBOUSHH: (in Ubese subtitled) I want fifty thousand.\\nNo less.\\n\\nJabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid\\noff the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh\\nadjusts his weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio\\nstruggles back onto the throne. The disheveled droid tries to\\ncompose himself.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? (to\\nBoushh) Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay\\nfifty thousand.\\n\\nThe bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand.\\nThreepio looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the\\nbounty hunter. The droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting\\nvery impatient.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Because he\\'s holding a thermal detonator.\\n\\nThe guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters\\nin the room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to\\nglow in the bounty hunter\\'s hand. The room has fallen into a\\ntense hush. Jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until\\na sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) This bounty hunter is\\nmy kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.\\n\\nJabba continues.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I\\nsuggest you take it.\\n\\nBib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for\\nhis reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator\\nand it goes dead.\\n\\nBOUSHH: Zeebuss.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: He agrees!\\n\\nThe raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and\\napplause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca\\ngrowls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as\\na skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and\\ndancing girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the\\nloudly appreciative creatures.\\n\\nBoushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys\\nthe scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare\\nfrom across the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts\\nslightly, cradling his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with\\nequally ominous arrogance.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL\\n\\nGamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before.\\nWhen a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie\\'s ferocious\\nROAR echoes against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into\\nits cell in terror. It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie\\nroughly into a cell, slamming the door behind him. Chewie lets\\nout a pathetic howl and bangs on the iron door.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: JABBA\\'S PALACE\\n\\nThe palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the\\nroad in front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out\\nfor a desert rodent and burps in satisfaction.\\n\\nINTERIOR: JABBA\\'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSilence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien\\ncelebration giving mute witness to the activity here before.\\nSeveral drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring\\nloudly.\\n\\nA shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the\\nperimeter of the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty\\nhunter. He picks his way carefully through the snoring, drunken\\nmonsters.\\n\\nHan Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall,\\nhis coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty\\nhunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch\\nto one side of the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the\\nfloor of the alcove.\\n\\nBoushh steps up to the case, studying Han, then turns to the\\ncontrols on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of\\nswitches and, after one last, hesitant look at Han, slides the\\ndecarbonization lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the\\nhard shell covering the contours of Han\\'s face begins to melt\\naway. The bounty hunter watches as Han\\'s body is freed of its\\nmetallic coat and his forearms and hands, previously raised in\\nreflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His face muscles\\nrelax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.\\n\\nBoushh\\'s ugly helmet leans close to Han\\'s face listening for the\\nbreath of life. Nothing. He waits. Han\\'s eyes pop open with a\\nstart and he begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the\\nstaggering newborn.\\n\\nBOUSHH: Just relax for a moment. You\\'re free of the\\ncarbonite.\\n\\nHan touches his face with his hand and moans.\\n\\nBOUSHH: Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.\\n\\nHAN: I can\\'t see.\\n\\nBOUSHH: Your eyesight will return in time.\\n\\nHAN: Where am I?\\n\\nBOUSHH: Jabba\\'s palace.\\n\\nHAN: Who are you?\\n\\nThe bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head,\\nrevealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.\\n\\nLEIA: Someone who loves you.\\n\\nHAN: Leia!\\n\\nLEIA: I gotta get you out of here.\\n\\nAs Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet\\nis pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of\\nthe alcove.\\n\\nHAN: What\\'s that? I know that laugh.\\n\\nThe curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba\\nthe Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again,\\nand his gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.\\n\\nHAN: Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way\\nto pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked.\\nIt\\'s not my fault.\\n\\nJabba laughs.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) It\\'s too late for\\nthat, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but\\nnow you\\'re Bantha fodder.\\n\\nHAN: Look...\\n\\nJABBA: (cont Huttese subtitled) Take him away!\\n\\nThe guards grab Han and start to lead him away.\\n\\nHAN: Jabba... I\\'ll pay you triple! You\\'re throwing\\naway a fortune here. Don\\'t be a fool!\\n\\nHan is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts\\nto lead Leia away.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) Bring her to me.\\n\\nJabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful\\nyoung princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster\\nand quickly turns away in disgust.\\n\\nLEIA: We have powerful friends. You\\'re gonna regret\\nthis...\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) I\\'m sure.\\n\\nInexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of\\nJabba\\'s ugly blob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.\\n\\nLEIA: Ugh!\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Ohhh, I can\\'t bear to watch.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DUNGEON CELL\\n\\nThe heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks\\nopen. A guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell\\nand the door slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of\\nlight from a crack in the door. Han is trying to collect himself\\nwhen suddenly a growl is heard from the far side of the cell. He\\njumps back against the cell door and listens.\\n\\nHAN: Chewie? Chewie, is that you?\\n\\nThe shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han,\\nlifting him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into\\nthe light, revealing Chewie.\\n\\nHAN: Ah! Chew--Chewie!\\n\\nThe giant Wookiee barks with glee.\\n\\nHAN: Wait. I can\\'t see, pal. What\\'s goin\\' on?\\n\\nChewie barks an excited blue streak.\\n\\nHAN: Luke? Luke\\'s crazy. He can\\'t even take care\\nof himself, much less rescue anybody.\\n\\nChewie barks a reply.\\n\\nHAN: A ...Jedi Knight? I--I\\'m out of it for a\\nlittle while, everybody gets delusions of\\ngrandeur.\\n\\nChewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his\\nhead.\\n\\nHAN: I\\'m all right, pal. I\\'m all right.\\n\\nINTERIOR: MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA\\'S PALACE\\n\\nNoisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding\\nLIGHT and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is\\nclad in a robe similar to Ben\\'s and wears neither pistol nor\\nlaser sword. Luke strides purposefully into the hallway. Two\\ngiant guards move to block Luke\\'s path. Luke halts.\\n\\nLuke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who\\nimmediately lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi\\nlowers his hand and moves on down the hallway.\\n\\nBib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they\\napproach each other, but Luke doesn\\'t stop and Bib must reverse\\nhis direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry\\non the conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in\\nthe darkness.\\n\\nLUKE: I must speak with Jabba.\\n\\nBib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops\\nand stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.\\n\\nLUKE: You will take me to Jabba now!\\n\\nBib turns in hypnotic response to Luke\\'s command, and Luke\\nfollows him into the gloom.\\n\\nLUKE: You serve your master well.\\n\\nBib responds.\\n\\nLUKE: And you will be rewarded.\\n\\n\\n=== INTERIOR: JABBA\\'S THRONE ROOM ===\\n\\nJabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him.\\nSalacious sits by Jabba\\'s tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now\\ndressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs\\nfrom a manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba\\nthe Hutt. Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the\\ngangster slug.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: At last! Master Luke\\'s come to rescue me.\\n\\nBIB: Master.\\n\\nJabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.\\n\\nBIB: ...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) I told you not to admit him.\\n\\nLUKE: I must be allowed to speak.\\n\\nBIB: (in Huttese subtitled) He must be allowed to speak.\\n\\nJabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) You weak-minded fool! He\\'s\\nusing an old Jedi mind trick.\\n\\nLuke stares hard at Jabba.\\n\\nLUKE: You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee\\nto me.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) Your mind powers will not\\nwork on me, boy.\\n\\nLUKE: Nevertheless, I\\'m taking Captain Solo and his\\nfriends. You can either profit by this... or be\\ndestroyed! It\\'s your choice. But I warn you not to\\nunderestimate my powers.\\n\\nJabba\\'s laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke\\nabout the pit.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Master Luke, you\\'re standing on...\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) There will be no\\nbargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.\\n\\nLuke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard\\'s holster and\\nflies into Luke\\'s hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as\\nJabba raises his hand.\\n\\nJABBA: Bascka!\\n\\nThe floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard\\ninto the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the\\nceiling. Jabba laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts\\nforward but is restrained by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable\\nbehind his mask. She looks at him and he shakes his head \"no.\"\\n\\nINTERIOR: RANCOR PIT\\n\\nLuke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute\\ninto the dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard\\nyells hysterically for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge\\nof the pit as the door in the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE\\nopen. The guard screams in panic. Luke looks calmly around for a\\nmeans of escape.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, no! The Rancor!\\n\\nAt the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant,\\nfanged RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and\\ntries futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes\\nin on him.\\n\\nThe Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to\\nscramble, the Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering\\njaws. A few screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The\\naudience cheers and laughs at the guard\\'s fate.\\n\\nThe monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away\\njust ahead of the monster\\'s swipe at him, and picks up the long\\narm bone of an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings\\nhim up to his salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges\\nthe bone in the monster\\'s mouth and is dropped to the floor. The\\nmonster bellows in rage and flails about, hitting the side of the\\npit, causing an avalanche.==\\n\\nThe monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who\\nsqueezes into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the\\nmonster to the holding cave beyond. On the far side of the\\nholding cave is a utility door--if only he can get to it. The\\nRancor spots Luke and reaches into the crevice for him. Luke\\ngrabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it down on the\\nRancor\\'s finger.\\n\\n\\n=== HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT ===\\nThe Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the\\nholding cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it.\\nWhen he succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and\\nsafety. Beyond the gate two guards look up from their dinner.\\nLuke turns to see the monster heading for him, and pulls with all\\nhis might on the gate. The guards move to the gate and start\\npoking at the young Jedi with spears, laughing.\\n\\nLuke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach\\nfor him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up\\nthe wall. As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a\\nskull from the cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant\\noverhead door comes crashing down on the beast\\'s head, squashing\\nit like a sledgehammer on an egg.\\n\\nA startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There\\'s\\nconsternation at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is\\nactually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy.\\nJabba utters harsh commands to his guards and they hurry off.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) Bring me Solo and the \\nWookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: RANCOR PIT===\\n\\nThe Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining\\ntheir dead beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other\\nglares menacingly at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush\\ninto the holding tunnel and take Luke away.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: THRONE ROOM===\\n\\nThe crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought\\ninto the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.\\n\\nLUKE: Han!\\n\\nHAN: Luke!\\n\\nLUKE: Are you all right?\\n\\nHAN: Fine. Together again, huh?\\n\\nLUKE: Wouldn\\'t miss it.\\n\\nHAN: How are we doing?\\n\\nLUKE: The same as always.\\n\\nHAN: That bad, huh? Where\\'s Leia?\\n\\nLuke looks to Leia.\\n\\nLEIA: I\\'m here.\\n\\nThreepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes\\nLeia like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando,\\nbring Luke from the other side of the room. Boba is standing\\nbehind Jabba.\\n\\nThreepio steps forward and translates for the captives.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great\\nJabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be \\nterminated immediately.\\n\\nHAN: Good, I hate long waits.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea\\nand cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of \\nthe all-powerful Sarlacc.\\n\\nHAN: (to Luke) Doesn\\'t sound so bad.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: In his belly, you will find a new definition\\nof pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over \\na thousand years.\\n\\nHAN: On second thought, let\\'s pass on that, huh?\\n\\nChewie barks his agreement.\\n\\nLUKE: You should have bargained, Jabba. That\\'s the\\nlast mistake you\\'ll ever make.\\n\\nJabba cackles evilly at this.\\n\\nAs the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud\\ncheer rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned\\nlooks, but Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: TATOOINE DUNE SEA===\\n\\nA herd of wild banthas treks across Tatooine\\'s dunes.\\n\\nJabba\\'s huge sail barge moves above the desert surface accompanied \\nby two smaller skiffs.\\n\\nINTERIOR: BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\\n\\nJabba\\'s entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and\\nhaving a good time.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: TATOOINE DUNE SEA\\n\\nThe sail barge and skiffs continue their journey.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: BARGE OBSERVATION DECK===\\n\\nJabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity\\nship. Leia is watching her friends in the one of the skiffs.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: TATOOINE DUNE SEA - SKIFF===\\n\\nThe skiff glides close, revealing Luke, Han, and Chewie -- all \\nin bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is Lando in \\ndisguise.\\n\\nHAN: I think my eyes are getting better. Instead\\nof a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.\\n\\nLUKE: There\\'s nothing to see. I used to live here,\\nyou know.\\n\\nHAN: You\\'re gonna die here, you know. Convenient.\\n\\nLUKE: Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I\\'ve\\ntaken care of everything.\\n\\nHAN: Oh... great!\\n\\n===INTERIOR: BARGE OBSERVATION DECK===\\n\\nThe chain attached to Leia\\'s neck is pulled tight and Jabba\\ntugs the scantily clad princess to him.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) Soon you will learn \\nto appreciate me.\\n\\nThreepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a\\nsmaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place.\\nThe stubby droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, I\\'m terribly sor... Artoo! What are you\\ndoing here?\\n\\nArtoo beeps a quick reply.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Well, I can see you\\'re serving drinks, but\\nthis place is dangerous. They\\'re going to execute \\nMaster Luke and, if we\\'re not careful, us too!\\n\\nArtoo whistles a singsong response.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: SARLACC PIT ===\\n\\nThe convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to\\none side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the\\nprisoner\\'s skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers.\\nAt the bottom of the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-\\nlined hole with a huge beak protruding from it, surrounded by\\nthousands of needle-sharp teeth and tentacles. This is the SARLACC.\\nA plank is extended from the edge of the prisoner\\'s skiff. Guards\\nrelease Luke\\'s bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the\\nSarlacc\\'s mouth.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\\n\\nJabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans\\nforward and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As\\nThreepio steps up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the\\nmotley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio\\'s\\nvoice is amplified across loudspeakers.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His\\nExcellency hopes that you will die honorably. But \\nshould any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great \\nJabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SKIFF\\n\\nHan steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.\\n\\nHAN: Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of...\\nworm-ridden filth he\\'ll get no such pleasure from \\nus. Right?\\n\\nChewie growls his agreement.\\n\\nLUKE: Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or\\ndie.\\n\\nLando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick\\nlook of conspiracy to him.\\n\\nINTERIOR: SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK\\n\\nThe assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips\\nunnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba\\'s laughter \\nsubsides as he speaks into the comlink.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) Move him into \\nposition.\\n\\nJabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: BARGE - UPPER DECK\\n\\nArtoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the\\npit. Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge\\nof the plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo,\\nthen gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been\\nwaiting for. A flap opens in Artoo\\'s domed head.\\n\\nJABBA: (in Huttese subtitled) Put him in.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SKIFF - PLANK\\n\\nLuke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the\\nbloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive\\nwhat is happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank\\nby his fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and\\ncatapults him skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and\\ndrops down on the end of the plank in the same spot he just\\nvacated, but facing the skiff. He casually extends an open palm\\nand -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has sent arcing toward him,\\ndrops into his hand.\\n\\nWith samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who\\nprodded him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming\\noverboard. The other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into\\nthem, lightsaber flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at\\nthe back of the skiff.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SARLACC PIT\\n\\nA bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and\\nbegins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs\\nhim and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.\\n\\nINTERIOR: SAIL BARGE\\n\\nJabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and\\nthe guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy\\ncreatures watching the action from the window are in an uproar.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SKIFF\\n\\nLuke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting\\nmouth of the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie\\'s bonds.\\n\\nLUKE: Easy, Chewie.\\n\\nAt that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of\\nblasts from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from\\nthe deck of the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and\\ndangles desperately above the Sarlacc pit.\\n\\nLANDO: Whoa! Whoa! Help!\\n\\nEXTERIOR: UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\\n\\nWith two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his\\nrocket pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to\\nthe skiff.\\n\\n\\n=== EXTERIOR: SKIFF ===\\n\\nBoba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke,\\nwho has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba\\ncan fire, the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and\\nhacks the bounty hunter\\'s gun in half.\\n\\nImmediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge\\'s\\ndeck gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown\\nagainst the rail.\\n\\nHAN: Chewie, you okay? Where is he?\\n\\nThe Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.\\n\\nHAN: I\\'m okay, pal.\\n\\nFor a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires\\na cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in\\na strong cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm\\nfree only from the wrist down. Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber\\npoints straight up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke\\nshrugs away the cable and stands free.\\n\\nAnother blast from the Barge\\'s deck gun hits near Boba and he is\\nknocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.\\n\\nLANDO: Han! Chewie?\\n\\nHAN: Lando!\\n\\nLuke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade\\nbrackets him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their\\nweapons, moves in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming\\nsecond skiff. The young Jedi leaps into the middle of the second\\nskiff and begins decimating the guards from their midst.\\n\\nChewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to\\nHan, guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of\\nthe guards. Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions;\\nfinally he grabs hold of the spear.\\n\\nBoba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at\\nthe other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba\\nraises his arm, and aims his lethal appendage.\\n\\nChewie barks desperately at Han.\\n\\nHAN: Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?\\n\\nThe space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his\\nhand whacks squarely in the middle of Boba\\'s rocket pack.\\n\\nThe impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba\\nblasts off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing\\nagainst the side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the\\npit. He screams as his armored body makes its last flight past\\nLando and directly into the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The\\nSarlacc burps. Chewie growls a weak congratulations to Han.\\n\\nINTERIOR: SAIL BARGE\\n\\nLeia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba\\'s throne,\\nand throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his\\nbulbous neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne,\\npulling the chain violently in her grasp. Jabba\\'s flaccid neck\\ncontracts beneath the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from\\ntheir sockets and his scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted\\nHutt\\'s huge tail spasms through its death throes and then slams\\ndown into final stillness. Leia struggles to free herself of her\\nbondage.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SKIFF\\n\\nLuke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards\\' skiff, as Han\\nextends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling\\nprecariously from a rope on the prisoner\\'s skiff.\\n\\nHAN: Lando, grab it!\\n\\nLANDO: Lower it!\\n\\nHAN: I\\'m trying!\\n\\nA major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side.\\nHan and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The\\nrope breaks, and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit.\\nLuckily, Han\\'s foot catches on the skiff railing and he dangles\\nabove Lando and the pit. The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff\\nfor dear life as another hit from the deck gun rocks the skiff\\nviolently.\\n\\nHAN: Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I\\'m slipping.\\n\\nChewie grabs hold of Han\\'s feet, holding him upside down, as Han\\nextends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of\\nthe pit.\\n\\nHAN: Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!\\n\\nLuke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the\\ndeck gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps\\nfrom the skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side\\nof the Sail Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a\\npainful climb up the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a\\nwindow an inch from his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the\\nwrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the broken\\nwindow and into the deadly pit.\\n\\nThe injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling\\nHan, who is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate\\nLando. The Baron has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of\\nthe Sarlacc pit by lying very still. Every time he tries to reach\\nfor Han, the loose sand moves him closer to his final reward.\\n\\nHAN: Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!\\n\\nAnother blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando\\nto let go of the spear.\\n\\nLANDO: Hold it! Whoa!\\n\\nAgain Han extends the spear toward Lando.\\n\\nHAN: Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy.\\nHold me, Chewie.\\n\\nLando screams. One of the Sarlacc\\'s tentacles has wrapped tightly\\naround his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.\\n\\nHAN: Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don\\'t move,\\nLando.\\n\\nLANDO: No, wait! I thought you were blind!\\n\\nHAN: It\\'s all right. Trust me. Don\\'t move.\\n\\nLANDO: All right! A little higher! Just a little\\nhigher!\\n\\nHan adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed\\npirate fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases\\nLando, and Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.\\n\\nHAN: Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up,\\nChewie, up!\\n\\nEXTERIOR: UPPER DECK\\n\\nThe deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human\\nchain in their gun sights when something up on deck commands\\ntheir attention: Luke, standing before them like a pirate king,\\nignites his lightsaber. The deck gunners have barely reached for\\ntheir pistols before the young Jedi has demolished them.\\nImmediately, Luke turns to see two more gunners (who have been\\nuncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) racing for him,\\nfiring their laser pistols.\\n\\nINTERIOR: SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK\\n\\nLeia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo\\nzips through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the\\nstubby little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the\\nchain apart.\\n\\nLEIA: Come on. We gotta get out of here.\\n\\nArtoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is\\nkicking and screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey-\\nmonster picks out one of the golden droid\\'s eyes.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh!\\nOhhh! You beast!\\n\\nArtoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a\\nscream, crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio\\n(with his eye dangling from a wire) hurry off.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE\\n\\nLuke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded\\nby guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck\\nas Luke turns to face another guard.\\n\\nLUKE: (to Leia) Get the gun! Point it at the deck!\\n\\nLeia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and\\nswivels the gun around.\\n\\nLUKE: Point it at the deck!\\n\\nA laser blast hits Luke\\'s mechanical hand and he bends over in\\npain, but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the\\nlast of the guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals\\nthe mechanism. He flexes the hand; it still works.\\n\\nNear the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady\\nthemselves as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo, where are we going? I couldn\\'t\\npossibly jump.\\n\\nArtoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,\\ntumbling toward the sand.\\n\\nLuke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun,\\nwhich she has brought around to point down at the deck.\\n\\nLUKE: Come on!\\n\\nLuke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He\\ngathers Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck\\ngun. The gun explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out\\ntoward the skiff.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SKIFF\\n\\nHan leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the\\ndeck. Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.\\n\\nLUKE: Let\\'s go! And don\\'t forget the droids.\\n\\nLANDO: We\\'re on our way.\\n\\nThe Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of\\nthe huge craft is on fire.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SAND DUNE\\n\\nThreepio\\'s legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed.\\nNext to it, Artoo\\'s periscope is the only thing above the sand.\\nThe skiff floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle\\ndown on a wire. With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled from\\nthe sand.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: DUNE SEA\\n\\nThe little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which\\ncontinues its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across\\nthe desert, the barge settles to the sand and disappears in one\\nfinal conflagration.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA\\n\\nA ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we\\nHEAR THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil\\nof sand, pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and\\nThreepio, followed by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come\\ninto view, each supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca,\\nwho hobbles from his wound.\\n\\nSoon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing\\nsand. It is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke\\'s\\ntrusty X-wing and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be\\nheard.\\n\\nHAN: I don\\'t know. All I can see is a lot of\\nblowing sand!\\n\\nLEIA: That\\'s all any of us can see.\\n\\nHAN: (blinking) Then I guess I\\'m getting better.\\n\\nAs soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the\\nwind dies down to something more describable as a severe weather\\ncondition. Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with\\na HUM.\\n\\nHAN: (turning to Luke) I\\'ve got to hand it to you, kid, you were\\npretty good out there.\\n\\nLUKE: (shrugging it off) I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.\\n\\nHAN: No, I\\'m thinking a lot about it. That carbon\\nfreeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And \\nit wasn\\'t just sleepin\\'. It was a big wide awake \\nnothing!\\n\\nLuke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi\\nwarrior, mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly\\nhugs him.\\n\\nLUKE: (moving to his ship) I\\'ll see you back at the fleet.\\n\\nHAN: Why don\\'t you leave that crate and come with\\nus?\\n\\nLUKE: I have a promise I have to keep first... to\\nan old friend.\\n\\nLuke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.\\n\\nHAN: (looking dubiously at Lando, obviously\\nremembering his friend\\'s betrayal and subsequent \\naide) Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.\\n\\nLANDO: Figured if I left you frozen like that you\\'d\\njust give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might \\nas well get you unfrozen sooner or later.\\n\\nLEIA: He means \"You\\'re welcome.\"\\n\\nLANDO: Come on, let\\'s get off this miserable dust\\nball.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE\\n\\nThe desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke\\'s X-wing\\nappears and peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON\\nappears as a dot and grows huge, to roar directly over the\\nCAMERA.\\n\\nINTERIOR: X-WING - COCKPIT\\n\\nLuke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside\\nthe canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the\\nMILLENNIUM FALCON.\\n\\nLUKE: I\\'ll meet you back at the fleet.\\n\\nLEIA: (over comlink) Hurry. The Alliance should \\nbe assembled by now.\\n\\nLUKE: I will.\\n\\nHAN: (over comlink) Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks \\nfor comin\\' after me. Now I owe you one.\\n\\nA message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front\\nof Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he\\npulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.\\n\\nLUKE: That\\'s right, Artoo. We\\'re going to the Dagobah system. I have a\\npromise to keep... to an old friend.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR\\n\\nA Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet\\nrest in space above the half-completed Death Star and its green\\nneighbor, Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial\\nshuttle toward the Death Star.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY\\n\\nLord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very\\nnervous Death Star commander.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR\\n\\nThousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth\\ndocking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform,\\nwhere the shuttle is coming to rest.\\n\\nThe shuttle\\'s ramp lowers and the Emperor\\'s Royal Guards come out\\nand create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid\\nattention with a momentous SNAP.\\n\\nThen, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He\\nis a rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes\\nits way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a\\nhooded cloak similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is\\nblack. The Emperor\\'s face is shrouded and difficult to see,\\nexcept for his piercing yellow eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and\\nDarth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme Ruler of the galaxy beckons\\nto the Dark Lord.\\n\\nEMPEROR: (to Vader) Rise, my friend.\\n\\nVader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes\\nhis way along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other\\ncommanders stay kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader,\\nfollowed by several Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do\\nthey join in the procession.\\n\\nVADER: The Death Star will be completed on schedule.\\n\\nEMPEROR: You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I\\nsense you wish to continue your search for young \\nSkywalker.\\n\\nVADER: Yes, my Master.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you\\nout. And when he does, you must bring him before me. \\nHe has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to \\nthe dark side of the Force.\\n\\nVADER: As you wish.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\\n\\nHe laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial\\ntroops.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: YODA\\'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH\\n\\nOnce again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp\\nenvirons of the swamp planet, and he\\'s none too happy about it.\\nHe beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda\\'s\\ncottage. Warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to\\nfight the gloom.\\n\\nINTERIOR: YODA\\'S HOUSE\\n\\nThe tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen\\nfloor of the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small\\ngreen hand that clutches it, and then to the familiar face of\\nYODA, THE JEDI MASTER. His manner is frail, and his voice, though\\ncheerful, seems weaker.\\n\\nYODA: Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to\\nyoung eyes?\\n\\nLuke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his\\nlook has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.\\n\\nLUKE: No... of course not.\\n\\nYODA: (tickled, chuckles) I do, yes, I do! Sick \\nhave I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked \\nfinger) When nine hundred years old you reach, \\nlook as good you will not. Hmm?\\n\\nYoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.\\n\\nYODA: Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned\\nit, I have.\\n\\nYoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.\\n\\nLUKE: Master Yoda, you can\\'t die.\\n\\nYODA: Strong am I with the Force... but not that\\nstrong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must \\nfall. That is the way of things... the way of the \\nForce.\\n\\nLUKE: But I need your help. I\\'ve come back to\\ncomplete the training.\\n\\nYODA: No more training do you require. Already know\\nyou that which you need.\\n\\nYoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.\\n\\nLUKE: Then I am a Jedi?\\n\\nYODA: (shakes his head) Ohhh. Not yet. One thing \\nremains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only \\nthen, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\\n\\nLuke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his\\ncourage. Finally he is able to ask.\\n\\nLUKE: Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?\\n\\nYoda\\'s eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad\\nsmile creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from\\nLuke.\\n\\nYODA: Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.\\n\\nLuke watches him, each moment an eternity.\\n\\nLUKE: Yoda, I must know.\\n\\nYODA: Your father he is.\\n\\nLuke reacts as if cut.\\n\\nYODA: Told you, did he?\\n\\nLUKE: Yes.\\n\\nA new look of concern crosses Yoda\\'s face. He closes his eyes.\\n\\nYODA: Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...\\n\\nLUKE: Unfortunate that I know the truth?\\n\\nYoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.\\n\\nYODA: (gathering all his strength) No. Unfortunate \\nthat you rushed to face him... that incomplete was \\nyour training. Not ready for the burden were you.\\n\\nLUKE: Well, I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nYODA: Remember, a Jedi\\'s strength flows from the\\nForce. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The \\ndark side are they. Once you start down the dark \\npath, forever will it dominate your destiny.\\n\\nHe beckons the young Jedi closer to him.\\n\\nYODA: Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate\\nthe powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father\\'s \\nfate, you will. Luke, when gone am I (cough), the \\nlast of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs \\nstrong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, \\nLuke... (with great effort) There is...another...\\nSky...Sky...walker.\\n\\nHe catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green\\ncreature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he\\ndisappears in front of his eyes.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING\\n\\nLuke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a\\ngreeting, but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels\\ndown, begins to help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes\\nhis head dejectedly.\\n\\nLUKE: I can\\'t do it, Artoo. I can\\'t go on alone.\\n\\nBEN: (OS) Yoda will always be with you.\\n\\nLuke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.\\n\\nLUKE: Obi-Wan! Why didn\\'t you tell me?\\n\\nThe ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.\\n\\nLUKE: You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my\\nfather.\\n\\nBEN: You father was seduced by the dark side of\\nthe Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and \\nbecame Darth Vader. When that happened, the good \\nman who was your father was destroyed. So what I \\nhave told you was true... from a certain point \\nof view.\\n\\nLUKE: (turning away, derisive) A certain point \\nof view!\\n\\nBEN: Luke, you\\'re going to find that many of the\\ntruths we cling to depend greatly on our own point \\nof view.\\n\\nLuke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.\\n\\nBEN: I don\\'t blame you for being angry. If I was\\nwrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn\\'t have \\nbeen for the first time. You see, what happened \\nto your father was my fault.\\n\\nBen pauses sadly.\\n\\nBEN: Anakin was a good friend.\\n\\nLuke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on\\na stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting\\npresence.\\n\\nBEN: When I first knew him, your father was already \\na great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the \\nForce was with him. I took it upon myself to train \\nhim as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him \\njust as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had \\nterrible consequences for the galaxy.\\n\\nLuke is entranced.\\n\\nLUKE: There\\'s still good in him.\\n\\nBEN: I also thought he could be turned back to the\\ngood side. It couldn\\'t be done. He is more machine \\nnow than man. Twisted and evil.\\n\\nLUKE: I can\\'t do it, Ben.\\n\\nBEN: You cannot escape your destiny.\\n\\nLUKE: I tried to stop him once. I couldn\\'t do it.\\n\\nBEN: Vader humbled you when first you met him,\\nLuke... but that experience was part of your\\ntraining. It taught you, among other things, the \\nvalue of patience. Had you not been so impatient \\nto defeat Vader then, you could have finished \\nyour training here with Yoda. You would have been \\nprepared.\\n\\nLUKE: But I had to help my friends.\\n\\nBEN: (grinning at Luke\\'s indignation) And did you \\nhelp them? It was they who had to save you. You \\nachieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\\n\\nLUKE: (with sadness) I found out Darth Vader was my \\nfather.\\n\\nBEN: To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and\\nthen go beyond the dark side - the side your father \\ncouldn\\'t get past. Impatience is the easiest door - \\nfor you, like your father. Only, your father was \\nseduced by what he found on the other side of the \\ndoor, and you have held firm. You\\'re no longer so \\nreckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And\\nnow, you must face Darth Vader again!\\n\\nLUKE: I can\\'t kill my own father.\\n\\nBEN: Then the Emperor has already won. You were\\nour only hope.\\n\\nLUKE: Yoda spoke of another.\\n\\nBEN: The other he spoke of is your twin sister.\\n\\nLUKE: But I have no sister.\\n\\nBEN: Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor,\\nyou were hidden from your father when you were \\nborn. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were \\nto have any offspring, they would be a threat to \\nhim. That is the reason why your sister remains \\nsafely anonymous.\\n\\nLUKE: Leia! Leia\\'s my sister.\\n\\nBEN: Your insight serves you well. Bury your\\nfeelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But \\nthey could be made to serve the Emperor.\\n\\nLuke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.\\n\\nBEN: (continuing his narrative) When your father \\nleft, he didn\\'t know your mother was pregnant. Your \\nmother and I knew he would find out eventually, but \\nwe wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for \\nas long as possible. So I took you to live with my \\nbrother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took \\nLeia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on \\nAlderaan.\\n\\nLuke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.\\n\\nBEN: (attempting to give solace with his words) The \\nOrgana household was high-born and politically quite \\npowerful in that system. Leia became a princess by \\nvirtue of lineage... no one knew she\\'d been adopted, \\nof course. But it was a title without real power, \\nsince Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, \\nthe family continued to be politically powerful, and \\nLeia, following in her foster father\\'s path, became \\na senator as well. That\\'s not all she became, of \\ncourse... she became the leader of her cell in the \\nAlliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she \\nhad diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for \\ngetting information to the Rebel cause. That\\'s what \\nshe was doing when her path crossed yours... for her \\nfoster parents had always told her to contact me on\\nTatooine, if her troubles became desperate.\\n\\nLuke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of\\nhis sister.\\n\\nLUKE: But you can\\'t let her get involved now, Ben.\\nVader will destroy her.\\n\\nBEN: She hasn\\'t been trained in the ways of the\\nJedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is \\nstrong with her, as it is with all of your family. \\nThere is no avoiding the battle. You must face and \\ndestroy Vader!\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE - REBEL FLEET\\n\\nThe vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see.\\nOverhead a dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation.\\nFighters and battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel\\nStar Cruisers, the HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.\\n\\nINTERIOR: HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM\\n\\nHundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled\\nin the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room\\nis a holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial\\nDeath Star, the nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting\\ndeflector shield.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a\\nstern but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are\\nseveral military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL\\nACKBAR (a salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the\\ncrowd until he finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and\\nthe two droids.\\n\\nHan peers at Lando\\'s new insignia on his chest, and is amused.\\n\\nHAN: Well, look at you, a general, huh?\\n\\nLANDO: Oh, well, someone must have told them about\\nmy little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.\\n\\nHAN: (sarcastic) Well, don\\'t look at me, pal. I just \\nsaid you were a fair pilot. I didn\\'t know they were\\nlookin\\' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.\\n\\nLANDO: (smiling) I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t ask you \\nto do it.\\n\\nHAN: Well, who says they didn\\'t. But I ain\\'t crazy. \\nYou\\'re the respectable one, remember?\\n\\nMon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls\\nsilent.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: The Emperor has made a critical error and \\nthe time for our attack has come.\\n\\nThis causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of\\nthe Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector\\nshield in the center of the room.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: The data brought to us by the Bothan spies\\npinpoints the exact location of the Emperor\\'s new \\nbattle station. We also know that the weapon systems of \\nthis Death Star are not yet operational. With the \\nImperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain \\neffort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But\\nmost important of all, we\\'ve learned that the Emperor \\nhimself is personally overseeing the final stages of \\nthe construction of this Death Star.\\n\\nA volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to\\nLeia as Chewie barks his amazement.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: (cont) Many Bothans died to bring us this\\ninformation. Admiral Ackbar, please.\\n\\nAdmiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star\\'s force\\nfield and the Moon of Endor.\\n\\nACKBAR: You can see here the Death Star orbiting the\\nforest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on \\nthis Death Star are not yet operational, the Death \\nStar does have a strong defense mechanism. It is \\nprotected by an energy shield, which is generated \\nfrom the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must\\nbe deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once \\nthe shield is down, our cruisers will create a \\nperimeter, while the fighters fly into the \\nsuperstructure and attempt to knock out the main \\nreactor.\\n\\nThere\\'s a concerned murmur.\\n\\nACKBAR: (cont) General Calrissian has volunteered to lead\\nthe fighter attack.\\n\\nHan turns to Lando with a look of respect.\\n\\nHAN: Good luck.\\n\\nLando nods his thanks.\\n\\nHAN: You\\'re gonna need it.\\n\\nACKBAR: General Madine.\\n\\nMadine moves center stage.\\n\\nGENERAL MADINE: We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.\\nDisguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial \\ncode, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate \\nthe shield generator.\\n\\nThe assembly begins to mumble among themselves.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Sounds dangerous.\\n\\nLEIA: (to Han) I wonder who they found to pull that off.\\n\\nGENERAL MADINE: General Solo, is your strike team \\nassembled?\\n\\nLeia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.\\n\\nHAN: Uh, my team\\'s ready. I don\\'t have a command\\ncrew for the shuttle.\\n\\nChewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers. Han looks up at\\nhim.\\n\\nHAN: Well, it\\'s gonna be rough, pal. I didn\\'t want\\nto speak for you.\\n\\nChewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.\\n\\nHAN: (smiles) That\\'s one.\\n\\nLEIA: Uh, General... count me in.\\n\\nVOICE: (OS) I\\'m with you, too!\\n\\nThey turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are\\nmore cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands\\nLuke. Han and Leia are surprised and delighted.\\n\\nLeia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change\\nin him and looks into his eyes questioningly.\\n\\nLEIA: What is it?\\n\\nLUKE: (hesitant) Ask me again sometime.\\n\\nHan, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks\\nup.\\n\\nHAN: Luke.\\n\\nLUKE: Hi, Han... Chewie.\\n\\nArtoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: \"Exciting\" is hardly the word I \\nwould use.\\n\\n== Part 2 ==\\n=== INTERIOR: HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY ===\\nThe Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE,\\nwhich looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast\\ndocking bay. Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads\\nArtoo and Threepio up the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel\\nstrike team loading weapons and supplies. Lando turns to face\\nHan. Luke and Leia have said their good-byes and start up the\\nramp.\\n\\nHAN: Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take\\nher. You need all the help you can get. She\\'s the \\nfastest ship in the fleet.\\n\\nLANDO: All right, old buddy. You know, I know what\\nshe means to you. I\\'ll take good care of her. She-\\nshe won\\'t get a scratch. All right?\\n\\nHAN: (looks at him warmly) Right. I got your promise \\nnow. Not a scratch.\\n\\nLANDO: Look, would you get going, you pirate.\\n\\nHan and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.\\n\\nLANDO: Good luck.\\n\\nHAN: You, too.\\n\\nHan goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns\\naway.\\n\\nINTERIOR: IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\\n\\nLuke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes\\nthe pilot\\'s seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to\\nfigure out all the Imperial controls.\\n\\nHAN: You got her warmed?\\n\\nLUKE: Yeah, she\\'s comin\\' up.\\n\\nChewie growls a complaint.\\n\\nHAN: No. I don\\'t think the Empire had Wookiees in\\nmind when they designed her, Chewie.\\n\\nLeia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.\\n\\nChewie barks and hits some switches. Han\\'s glance has stuck on\\nsomething out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him\\ngently.\\n\\nLEIA: Hey, are you awake?\\n\\nHAN: Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I\\'m\\nnot gonna see her again.\\n\\nChewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out\\nat the Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han\\'s shoulder.\\n\\nLEIA: (softly) Come on, General, let\\'s move.\\n\\nHan snaps back to life.\\n\\nHAN: Right. Chewie, let\\'s see what this piece of\\njunk can do. Ready, everybody?\\n\\nLUKE: All set.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Here we go again.\\n\\nHAN: All right, hang on.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET===\\n\\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the\\nHeadquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and\\nzooms off into space.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: EMPEROR\\'S THRONE ROOM===\\n\\nThe converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of\\nlight at the far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate\\ncontrol chair before a large window which looks out across the\\nhalf-completed Death Star to the giant green moon of Endor.\\n\\nDarth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council,\\ncautiously approaches his master. The ruler\\'s back is to Vader.\\nAfter several tense moments, the Emperor\\'s chair rotates around\\nto face him.\\n\\nVADER: What is thy bidding, my Master?\\n\\nEMPEROR: Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.\\nThere it will stay until called for.\\n\\nVADER: What of the reports of the Rebel fleet\\nmassing near Sullust?\\n\\nEMPEROR: It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will\\nbe crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your \\nwork here is finished, my friend. Go out to the \\ncommand ship and await my orders.\\n\\nVADER: Yes, my Master.\\n\\nVader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor\\nwalks toward the waiting council members.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON===\\n\\nThere is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as\\nconstruction proceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE\\nfighters, and a few Star Destroyers move about. Now the huge\\nSuper Star Destroyer announces itself with a low roar and soon\\nfills the frame.\\n\\nINTERIOR: STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT\\n\\nHan looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches.\\nThrough the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star\\nDestroyer can be seen.\\n\\nHAN: If they don\\'t go for this, we\\'re gonna have\\nto get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.\\n\\nChewie growls his agreement.\\n\\nCONTROLLER: (over radio) We have you on our screen \\nnow. Please identify.\\n\\nHAN: Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of\\nthe deflector shield.\\n\\nCONTROLLER: (over radio) Shuttle Tydirium, transmit \\nthe clearance code for shield passage.\\n\\nHAN: Transmission commencing.\\n\\nLeia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed\\ntransmission begins.\\n\\nLEIA: Now we find out if that code is worth the\\nprice we paid.\\n\\nHAN: It\\'ll work. It\\'ll work.\\n\\nChewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star\\nDestroyer that looms ever larger before them.\\n\\nLUKE: Vader\\'s on that ship.\\n\\nHAN: Now don\\'t get jittery, Luke. There are a lot\\nof command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, \\nbut don\\'t look like you\\'re trying to keep your \\ndistance.\\n\\nChewie barks a question.\\n\\nHAN: I don\\'t know. Fly casual.\\n\\nLUKE: I\\'m endangering the mission. I shouldn\\'t have\\ncome.\\n\\nHAN: It\\'s your imagination, kid. Come on. Let\\'s\\nkeep a little optimism here.\\n\\nChewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger\\nout the window.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE===\\n\\nLord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death\\nStar. Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn.\\nAfter a moment of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers\\nto where ADMIRAL PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the\\ncontroller we\\'ve seen earlier. Piett straightens at Vader\\'s\\napproach.\\n\\nVADER: Where is that shuttle going?\\n\\nPIETT: (into comlink) Shuttle Tydirium, what is \\nyour cargo and destination?\\n\\nPILOT VOICE: (HAN)(filtered) Parts and technical \\ncrew for the forest moon.\\n\\nThe Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.\\n\\nVADER: Do they have a clearance code?\\n\\nPIETT: It\\'s an older code, sir, but it checks out. I\\nwas about to clear them.\\n\\nVader looks upward, as he senses Luke\\'s presence.\\n\\nPIETT: Shall I hold them?\\n\\nVADER: No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them\\nmyself.\\n\\nPIETT: (surprised) As you wish, my lord. \\n(to controller) Carry on.\\n\\nPiett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT===\\n\\nThe group waits tensely.\\n\\nHAN: They\\'re not goin\\' for it, Chewie.\\n\\nCONTROLLER: (filtered) Shuttle Tydirium, \\ndeactivation of the shield will commence \\nimmediately. Follow your present course.\\n\\nEveryone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks\\nworried. Chewie barks.\\n\\nHAN: Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No\\nproblem.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR===\\n\\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary\\nMoon.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR===\\n\\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon\\'s\\ndark, primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.\\n\\nOn an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way\\nup a steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and\\nLuke. The troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and\\nThreepio bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.\\n\\nUp ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop\\nsuddenly to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop.\\nHan and Luke crawl up to take a look.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.\\n\\nTHEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering\\nthrough bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are\\nparked nearby.\\n\\nLEIA: Shall we try and go around?\\n\\nHAN: It\\'ll take time. This whole party\\'ll be for\\nnothing if they see us.\\n\\nLeia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and\\nChewie start quietly down.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE===\\n\\nThe four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not\\nfar from the two Imperial scouts.\\n\\nHAN: Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay\\nhere.\\n\\nLUKE: Quietly, there might be more of them out\\nthere.\\n\\nHAN: (grins) Hey... it\\'s me.\\n\\nHan and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the\\nscouts. Luke and Leia exchange smiles.\\n\\nHan sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the\\nscout whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his\\ncompanion.\\n\\nSCOUT #1: Go for help! Go!\\n\\nThe second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but\\nChewie gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the\\nscout to crash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing\\nfistfight.\\n\\nLUKE: (sarcastic) Great. Come on.\\n\\nLuke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser\\npistol drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and\\npoints to where two more scouts are sitting on their speeder\\nbikes, with an unoccupied bike parked nearby.\\n\\nLEIA: Over there! Two more of them!\\n\\nLUKE: I see them. Wait, Leia!\\n\\nBut Leia doesn\\'t hear him and races for the remaining speeder\\nbike. She starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike\\nbehind her.\\n\\nLUKE: (pointing to the controls) Quick! Jam \\ntheir comlink. Center switch!\\n\\nLuke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely\\navoiding two huge trees.\\n\\nHAN: Hey, wait! Ahhh!\\n\\nHe flips the remaining scout to the ground.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE===\\nThe two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia\\npursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire\\nfrom their bike\\'s laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving\\ntargets.\\n\\nLUKE: Move closer!\\n\\nLeia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer\\nthrough a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a\\ntree, slowing the scout.\\n\\nLUKE: Get alongside that one!\\n\\nLeia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout\\'s bike that\\ntheir steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to\\nthe back of the scout\\'s, grabs the Imperial warrior around the\\nneck, and flips him off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke\\ngains control of the bike and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead.\\nThey tear off after the remaining scout.\\n\\nLUKE: Get him!\\n\\nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two\\nswing into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their\\nlaser cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke\\'s bike\\ntakes a glancing hit.\\n\\nLUKE: (indicating the one ahead) Keep on that \\none! I\\'ll take these two!\\n\\nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes\\ninto the braking mode. Luke\\'s bike is a blur to the two pursuing\\nscouts as they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike\\ninto forward and starts firing away, having switched places with\\nhis pursuers in a manner of seconds. Luke\\'s aim is good and one\\nscout\\'s bike is blasted out of control. It explodes against a\\ntree trunk.\\n\\nThe scout\\'s cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts\\ninto turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.\\n\\nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom\\nthrough the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward\\nand rises out of sight.\\n\\nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer.\\nSuddenly, Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting.\\nThe scout\\'s bike takes a glancing hit.\\n\\nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him,\\nreaches down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the\\nscout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives\\noff as her bike explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks\\nback at the explosion. But when he turns forward again, he is on\\na collision course with a giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes\\nto no avail and disappears in a conflagration.\\n\\nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout\\ncontinue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up\\nclose. The scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke\\'s. A\\nfallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout zips\\nunder. Luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the\\nscout\\'s. Both riders look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in\\nLuke\\'s path, but the scout\\'s bike beside him makes it almost\\nimpossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all his might,\\nleaning almost horizontal over the scout\\'s bike, and is able to\\nmake it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and\\nthe scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes\\nand are moving as one.\\n\\nAnother big tree looms in Luke\\'s path. He reacts instinctively\\nand dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before\\nLuke\\'s explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles\\nback to find Luke.\\n\\nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him\\nand opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser\\nsword and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout\\'s bike keeps\\ncoming and it appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half.\\nAt the last instant, Luke steps aside and chops off the bike\\'s\\ncontrol vanes with one mighty slash. The scout\\'s bike begins to\\nshudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to slam directly\\ninto a tree in a giant ball of fire.\\n\\n==Part 3==\\n=== EXTERIOR: SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST ===\\nHan, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad,\\nwait anxiously in the clearing. Artoo\\'s radar screen sticks out\\nof his domed head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, General Solo, somebody\\'s coming. Oh!\\n\\nHan, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.\\n\\nLuke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him.\\nHe\\'s too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and\\nlooks around.\\n\\nHAN: Luke! Where\\'s Leia?\\n\\nLUKE: (concerned) What? She didn\\'t come back?\\n\\nHAN: I thought she was with you.\\n\\nLUKE: We got separated.\\n\\nLuke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.\\n\\nLUKE: Hey, we better go look for her.\\n\\nHan nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.\\n\\nHAN: Take the squad ahead. We\\'ll meet at the\\nshield generator at 0300.\\n\\nLUKE: Come on, Artoo. We\\'ll need your scanners.\\n\\nLuke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as\\nthe squad proceeds in another.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Don\\'t worry, Master Luke. We know what to\\ndo.\\n\\nThey move off into the woods.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: (to Artoo) And you said it was pretty \\nhere. Ugh!\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST CLEARING - LEIA\\'S CRASH SITE===\\n\\nA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly\\ninto view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He\\nseems somewhat puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess\\ngroans; this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her\\nagain. Leia sits up and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She\\ntries to figure out where she is and what has happened. Her\\nclothes are torn; she\\'s bruised and disheveled.\\n\\nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he\\nholds in a defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles\\nwarily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear.\\n\\nLEIA: Cut it out!\\n\\nShe stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.\\n\\nLEIA: I\\'m not gonna hurt you.\\n\\nLeia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains\\nof her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen\\nlog.\\n\\nLEIA: Well, looks like I\\'m stuck here. Trouble is,\\nI don\\'t know where here is.\\n\\nShe puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness\\nfrom her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and\\npats the log beside her.\\n\\nLEIA: Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.\\n\\nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy.\\nLeia pats the log again.\\n\\nLEIA: I promise I won\\'t hurt you. Now come here.\\n\\nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.\\n\\nLEIA: All right. You want something to eat?\\n\\nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him.\\nWicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves\\ncautiously toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.\\n\\nLEIA: That\\'s right. Come on. Hmmm?\\n\\nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits\\non the log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little\\ncreature jumps back, startled again. He runs along the log,\\npointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak. Leia\\nholds out the helmet to him.\\n\\nLEIA: Look, it\\'s a hat. It\\'s not gonna hurt you.\\nLook. You\\'re a jittery little thing, aren\\'t you?\\n\\nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log,\\ncoming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and\\nhe begins to sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering\\nsome Ewokese warning to Leia.\\n\\nLEIA: What is it?\\n\\nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on\\nthe log next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the\\nlog, hiding behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while\\nWicket disappears underneath the log. Another shot, and still no\\nsight of anyone in the forest. Then Leia senses something and\\nturns to find a large IMPERIAL SCOUT standing over her with his\\nweapon pointed at her head. He reaches out his hand for her\\nweapon.\\n\\nSCOUT #l: Freeze! Come on, get up!\\n\\nShe hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the\\nfoliage in front of the log.\\n\\nSCOUT #1: Go get your ride and take her back to base.\\n\\nSCOUT #2: Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched\\nunder the log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the\\nleg. The scout jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down\\nat Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She\\ndives for his laser pistol, and the second scout, now on his\\nbike, takes off. Leia fires away and hits the escaping bike,\\ncausing it to crash into the first scout\\'s bike, which flies end\\nover end and explodes. The forest is quiet once more. Wicket\\npokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards Leia with\\nnew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking\\naround all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into\\nthe dense foliage.\\n\\nLEIA: Come on, let\\'s get outta here.\\n\\nAs they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks\\nand tugs at Leia to follow him.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR\\'S TOWER===\\n\\nDarth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor\\'s Tower and\\nprivate elevator. The Emperor\\'s private guard steps in Vader\\'s\\npath.\\n\\nGUARD: Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be\\ndisturbed at the moment.\\n\\nVADER: (raising his gloved hand to the two guards\\nand choking them with the Force) The Emperor will \\nsee me, now!\\n\\nGUARD: (repeating Vader\\'s command) The Emperor \\nwill see you, now.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: EMPEROR\\'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM===\\n\\nTwo red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door\\nopens to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne\\nroom. It appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches\\nthe throne. He waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his\\nback to the Dark Lord.\\n\\nEMPEROR: I told you to remain on the command ship.\\n\\nVADER: A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield\\nand landed on Endor.\\n\\nEMPEROR: (no surprise) Yes, I know.\\n\\nVADER: (after a beat) My son is with them.\\n\\nEMPEROR: (very cool) Are you sure?\\n\\nVADER: I have felt him, my Master.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your\\nfeelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.\\n\\nVader knows what is being asked.\\n\\nVADER: They are clear, my Master.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and\\nwait for them.\\n\\nVADER: (skeptical) He will come to me?\\n\\nEMPEROR: I have foreseen it. His compassion for you\\nwill be his undoing. He will come to you and then you \\nwill bring him before me.\\n\\nVADER: (bows)As you wish.\\n\\nThe Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST CLEARING - LEIA\\'S CRASH SITE===\\n\\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move\\nthrough the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw\\nLeia. Luke finds Leia\\'s helmet, picks it up with an expression of\\nconcern.\\n\\nHAN: (OS) Luke! Luke!\\n\\nLuke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred\\nwreckage of a speeder bike in the grass.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, Master Luke.\\n\\nLUKE: There\\'s two more wrecked speeders back there.\\nAnd I found this.\\n\\nHe tosses the helmet to Han.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I\\'m afraid that Artoo\\'s sensors can find no\\ntrace of Princess Leia.\\n\\nHAN: (gravely) I hope she\\'s alright.\\n\\nChewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off\\nthrough the foliage.\\n\\nHAN: What, Chewie? What? Chewie!\\n\\nThe others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots\\nalong, Artoo whistles nervously.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE===\\n\\nThe group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up\\nto a tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal\\nhanging from it.\\n\\nHAN: Hey, I don\\'t get it.\\n\\nThe rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.\\n\\nHAN: (cont) Nah, it\\'s just a dead animal, Chewie.\\n\\nChewie can\\'t resist. He reaches toward the meat.\\n\\nLUKE: Chewie, wa-wait! Don\\'t!\\n\\nToo late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the\\nstake. SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an\\nEwok net, suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a\\nwild series of beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret.\\nTheir bodies are a jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw\\nfrom his mouth.\\n\\nHAN: Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always\\nthinking with your stomach.\\n\\nLUKE: Will you take it easy? Let\\'s just figure out\\na way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an \\narm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?\\n\\nHAN: Yeah, sure.\\n\\nArtoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his\\ncutting appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to\\nsqueeze an arm past Threepio to get at Luke\\'s lightsaber. The net\\ncontinues to spin.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo, I\\'m not sure that\\'s such a good idea.\\nIt\\'s a very long dro-o-op!!\\n\\nArtoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the\\nnet, crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and\\nsit up, they realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks,\\neach brandishing a long spear.\\n\\nHAN: Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else.\\n\\nHan pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a\\nsecond Ewok warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear\\nreturns to Han\\'s face. He grabs it angrily and starts to go for\\nhis laser pistol.\\n\\nHAN: Hey!\\n\\nLUKE: Han, don\\'t. It\\'ll be all right.\\n\\nThe Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke\\nlets them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry\\ncritters.\\n\\nLUKE: Chewie, give \\'em your crossbow.\\n\\nArtoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets\\nfree of the net and sits up, rattled.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!\\n\\nWhen the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter\\namong themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue.\\nThe Ewok nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself\\nbefore the droid. In a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit.\\nChewie lets out a puzzled bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed\\ncreatures in wonder. The Ewoks begin to chant at Threepio.\\n\\nLUKE: Do you understand anything they\\'re saying?\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am\\nfluent in over six million forms of communication.\\n\\nHAN: What are you telling them?\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Hello, I think... I could be mistaken.\\nThey\\'re using a very primitive dialect. But I do \\nbelieve they think I am some sort of god.\\n\\nChewbacca and Artoo think that\\'s very funny. Han and Luke\\nexchange \"what next?\" looks.\\n\\nHAN: Well, why don\\'t you use your divine influence\\nand get us out of this?\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that\\njust wouldn\\'t be proper.\\n\\nHAN: Proper?!\\n\\nTHREEPIO: It\\'s against my programming to impersonate a\\ndeity.\\n\\nHan moves toward Threepio threateningly.\\n\\nHAN: Why, you--\\n\\nSeveral Ewoks\\' spears are thrust in Han\\'s face at the affront to\\ntheir god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is\\nsurrounded by a menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He\\nholds up his hands placatingly.\\n\\nHAN: My mistake. He\\'s an old friend of mine.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS\\n\\nA procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest.\\nTheir prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long\\npoles and wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.\\n\\nEach pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind\\nthe captives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by\\nthe remaining creatures.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST===\\n\\nThe procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high\\nin the giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which\\ndrops off into nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a\\nvillage of mud huts and rickety walkways, attached to the giant\\ntrees. The lead Ewok takes hold of a long vine and swings across\\nto the village square; the other Ewoks follow suit.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE===\\n\\nThe procession winds its way into the village square. Mother\\nEwoks gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the\\nsight of the newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.\\n\\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han\\nis placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the\\nothers are leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio\\'s litter/throne\\nis gently placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination.\\nHan, Luke, and Chewie are less than fascinated.\\n\\nHAN: I have a really bad feeling about this.\\n\\nChewie growls his concern.\\n\\nSuddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man,\\ncomes out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully,\\ngoes to join Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an\\nelevated platform. A larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is\\nexamining Luke\\'s lightsaber with great curiosity.\\n\\nLogray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks,\\npointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin\\nfilling the pit under Han with firewood.\\n\\nHAN: What did he say?\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I\\'m rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it\\nappears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my \\nhonor.\\n\\nThe drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the\\nlarge hut. Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees\\nwhat\\'s happening at the same moment the prisoners see her.\\n\\nHAN and LUKE: Leia!\\n\\nAs she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised\\nspears.\\n\\nLEIA: Oh!\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Your Royal Highness.\\n\\nArtoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the\\nassembled Ewoks and sighs.\\n\\nLEIA: But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them\\nthey must be set free.\\n\\nThreepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their\\nheads negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners\\nand barks some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood\\non the barbecue with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke\\nand Han.\\n\\nHAN: Somehow, I got the feeling that didn\\'t help us \\nvery much.\\n\\nLUKE: Threepio, tell them if they don\\'t do as you\\nwish, you\\'ll become angry and use your magic.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn\\'t\\npossibly --\\n\\nLUKE: Just tell them.\\n\\nThreepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray\\nsteps forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and\\nbegins to concentrate.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: You see, Master Luke; they didn\\'t believe me.\\nJust...\\n\\nNow the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from\\nthe ground. At first Threepio doesn\\'t notice and keeps talking.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: ...as I said they wouldn\\'t. Wha-wha-what\\'s\\nhappening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!\\n\\nThe Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now\\nThreepio begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool,\\nwith Threepio calling out in total panic at his situation.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo!\\nSomebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, \\nquickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!\\n\\nChief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and\\nrelease the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group\\nembrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping\\nup at him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to\\nthe ground. Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo\\ncrashes to the ground. When the Ewoks set him upright, the little\\ndroid is fighting mad. Artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest\\nEwok, and begins pursuing him, finally getting close enough to\\nzap him with an electric charge. The Ewok jumps two feet in the\\nair and runs away, screaming. A small group of Ewoks surround the\\ngiant Wookiee, scratching their heads and marveling at his\\nheight.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.\\n\\nLUKE: Thanks, Threepio.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: (still shaken) I... I never knew I had it \\nin me.\\n\\n\\n=== INTERIOR: CHIEF\\'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS ===\\n\\nA glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged\\nroom, creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one\\nside, a group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on\\nhis throne. The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with\\nThreepio between the two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one\\nside.\\n\\nThreepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok\\'s\\nsqueaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and\\noccasionally murmur comments to each other. Threepio points\\nseveral times at the Rebel group and pantomimes a short history\\nof the Galactic Civil War, mimicking the explosion and rocket\\nsounds, imitating Imperial walkers. Throughout the long account,\\ncertain familiar names are distinguishable in English: Princess\\nLeia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Artoo\\nbegins beeping excitedly at Threepio.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.\\n\\nThreepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader,\\nHan Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the\\npresent time.\\n\\nAt the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then\\nnod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.\\n\\nThe drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great\\ncheer and screeches.\\n\\nHAN: What\\'s going on?\\n\\nLEIA: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nLuke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now\\nsomething passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The\\nothers do not notice.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\\n\\nSeveral of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.\\n\\nHAN: Just what I always wanted.\\n\\nChewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while\\nWicket clings to Han\\'s leg.\\n\\nHAN: (chuckles) Well, short help is better than no \\nhelp at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: He says the scouts are going to show us the\\nquickest way to the shield generator.\\n\\nChewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he\\nwanders outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.\\n\\nHAN: Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some\\nfresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons \\nback.\\n\\nHan pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.\\n\\nHAN: (cont) And hurry up, will ya? I haven\\'t got all day.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT\\n\\nThe walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow\\nand flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill\\nthe soft night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief\\'s hut\\nand stands staring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like\\nthat.\\n\\nLEIA: Luke, what\\'s wrong?\\n\\nLuke turns and looks at her a long moment.\\n\\nLUKE: Leia... do you remember your mother? Your\\nreal mother?\\n\\nLEIA: Just a little bit. She died when I was very\\nyoung.\\n\\nLUKE: What do you remember?\\n\\nLEIA: Just...images, really. Feelings.\\n\\nLUKE: Tell me.\\n\\nLEIA: (a little surprised at his insistence) She \\nwas very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. (looks up) \\nWhy are you asking me all this?\\n\\nHe looks away.\\n\\nLUKE: I have no memory of my mother. I never knew\\nher.\\n\\nLEIA: Luke, tell me. What\\'s troubling you?\\n\\nLUKE: Vader is here...now, on this moon.\\n\\nLEIA: (alarmed) How do you know?\\n\\nLUKE: I felt his presence. He\\'s come for me. He can\\nfeel when I\\'m near. That\\'s why I have to go. (facing \\nher) As long as I stay, I\\'m endangering the group and \\nour mission here. (beat) I have to face him.\\n\\nLeia is distraught, confused.\\n\\nLEIA: Why?\\n\\nLuke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.\\n\\nLUKE: He\\'s my father.\\n\\nLEIA: Your father?\\n\\nLUKE: There\\'s more. It won\\'t be easy for you to\\nhear it, but you must. If I don\\'t make it back,\\nyou\\'re the only hope for the Alliance.\\n\\nLeia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.\\n\\nLEIA: Luke, don\\'t talk that way. You have a power\\nI--I don\\'t understand and could never have.\\n\\nLUKE: You\\'re wrong, Leia. You have that power too.\\nIn time you\\'ll learn to use it as I have. The Force\\nis strong in my family. My father has it...I have\\nit...and...my sister has it.\\n\\nLeia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But\\nshe doesn\\'t draw away. She begins to understand.\\n\\nLUKE: Yes. It\\'s you Leia.\\n\\nLEIA: I know. Somehow...I\\'ve always known.\\n\\nLUKE: Then you know why I have to face him.\\n\\nLEIA: No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel\\nyour presence, then leave this place. I wish I could\\ngo with you.\\n\\nLUKE: No, you don\\'t. You\\'ve always been strong.\\n\\nLEIA: But, why must you confront him?\\n\\nLUKE: Because...there is good in him. I\\'ve felt it.\\nHe won\\'t turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him.\\nI can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.\\n\\nThey hold each other close and look at each other, brother and\\nsister.\\n\\nLeia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves\\naway. He disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the\\nvillage. Leia, bathed in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes\\nout of the Chief\\'s hut and comes over to her.\\n\\nLeia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only now that she\\nis crying.\\n\\nHAN: Hey, what\\'s goin\\' on?\\n\\nLeia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.\\n\\nLEIA: Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a\\nlittle while.\\n\\nHAN: (angry) Nothing? Come on, tell me. What\\'s\\ngoin\\' on?\\n\\nShe looks up at him, struggling to control herself.\\n\\nLEIA: I... I can\\'t tell you.\\n\\nHAN: (loses his temper) Did you tell Luke? Is that\\nwho you could tell?\\n\\nLEIA: I...\\n\\nHAN: Ahhh...\\n\\nHe starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to\\nher.\\n\\nHAN: I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nLEIA: Hold me.\\n\\nHan gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.\\n\\n== Part 4 ==\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM===\\n\\nAn Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands\\ngracefully on the huge platform.\\n\\nNow, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness\\nof the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military -\\nlooks particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK===\\n\\nDarth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform,\\ninto an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He\\nwalks toward another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a\\ncommander with Luke, in binders, at their center. The young Jedi\\ngazes at Vader with complete calm.\\n\\nCOMMANDER: This is a Rebel that surrendered to us.\\nAlthough he denies it, I believe there may be more\\nof them, and I request permission to conduct a\\nfurther search of the area.\\n\\nThe commander extends his hand, revealing Luke\\'s lightsaber.\\n\\nCOMMANDER: He was armed only with this.\\n\\nVader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking\\nthe lightsaber from the commander\\'s hand.\\n\\nVADER: Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your\\nsearch and bring his companions to me.\\n\\nCOMMANDER: Yes, my Lord.\\n\\nThe officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing\\nalone in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of\\nthe forest filter in upon them.\\n\\nVADER: The Emperor has been expecting you.\\n\\nLUKE: I know, father.\\n\\nVADER: So, you have accepted the truth.\\n\\nLURE: I\\'ve accepted the truth that you were once\\nAnakin Skywalker, my father.\\n\\nVADER: (turning to face him) That name no longer\\nhas any meaning for me.\\n\\nLUKE: It is the name of your true self. You\\'ve only\\nforgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor\\nhasn\\'t driven it from you fully. That is why you\\ncouldn\\'t destroy me. That\\'s why you won\\'t bring me\\nto your Emperor now.\\n\\nVader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black-\\ngloved hand. He seems to ponder Luke\\'s words.\\n\\nVADER: (indicating lightsaber) I see you have\\nconstructed a new lightsaber.\\n\\nVader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming,\\nbrilliant blade.\\n\\nVADER: Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are\\npowerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.\\n\\nThey stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.\\n\\nLUKE: Come with me.\\n\\nVADER: Obi-Wan once thought as you do.\\n\\nLuke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.\\n\\nVADER: You don\\'t know the power of the dark side. I\\nmust obey my master.\\n\\nLUKE: I will not turn...and you\\'ll be forced to\\nkill me.\\n\\nVADER: If that is your destiny.\\n\\nLUKE: Search your feelings, father. You can\\'t do\\nthis. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of\\nyour hate.\\n\\nVADER: It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will\\nshow you the true nature of the Force. He is your\\nmaster now.\\n\\nVader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand\\nstaring at one another for a long moment.\\n\\nLUKE: Then my father is truly dead.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR===\\n\\nHan, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout,\\nPAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield\\ngenerator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing\\nplatform. Leia studies the installation.\\n\\nLEIA: The main entrance to the control bunker\\'s on\\nthe far side of that landing platform. This isn\\'t\\ngonna be easy.\\n\\nHAN: Hey, don\\'t worry. Chewie and me got into a\\nlot of places more heavily guarded than this.\\n\\nWicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They\\nspeak to Threepio.\\n\\nLEIA: What\\'s he saying?\\n\\nTHREEPIO: He says there\\'s a secret entrance on the\\nother side of the ridge.\\nPart 4\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE - REBEL FLEET\\n\\nThe vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel\\nStar Cruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon\\nroars up to a spot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT===\\n\\nLando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes\\nsome getting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon\\'s\\ncockpit. Lando speaks into his comlink.\\n\\nLANDO: Admiral, we\\'re in position. All fighters\\naccounted for.\\n\\nACKBAR: (VO) Proceed with the countdown. All groups\\nassume attack coordinates.\\n\\nLando turns to his weird copilot.\\n\\nLANDO: Don\\'t worry, my friends are down there.\\nThey\\'ll have that shield down on time...(to himself)\\nor this\\'ll be the shortest offensive of all time.\\n\\nThe copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.\\n\\nACKBAR: (VO) All craft, prepare to jump to\\nhyperspace on my mark.\\n\\nLANDO: All right. Stand by.\\n\\nHe pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: SPACE - REBEL FLEET===\\n\\nWe are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon,\\nthen Ackbar\\'s Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge\\nfleet ROARS INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER\\n\\nHan, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket\\nand Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire\\ngroup is spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the\\nBUNKER that leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their\\nspeeder bikes parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance.\\nChewie growls an observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in\\nEwok language.\\n\\nHAN: Back door, huh? Good idea.\\n\\nWicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.\\n\\nHAN: (cont) It\\'s only a few guards. This shouldn\\'t\\nbe too much trouble.\\n\\nLEIA: Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.\\n\\nHAN: (with self-confident grin) Then we\\'ll do it\\nreal quiet-like.\\n\\nThreepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The\\nEwoks chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up\\nand scampers into the underbrush.\\n\\nThreepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short\\nreply.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!\\n\\nLEIA: Quiet.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I\\'m afraid our furry companion has gone and\\ndone something rather rash.\\n\\nLEIA: Oh, no.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: BUNKER - ENTRANCE===\\n\\nPaploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial\\nscouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body\\nonto one of the scout\\'s speeder bikes and begins flipping\\nswitches at random. Suddenly, the bike\\'s engine fires up with a\\ntremendous ROAR. Paploo grins and continues flipping switches.\\nThe scouts leap up in surprise.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: RIDGE\\n\\nHan, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.\\n\\nHAN: (sighs) There goes our surprise attack.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: BUNKER\\n\\nThe Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms\\ninto motion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the\\nforest.\\n\\nSCOUT: Look! Over there! Stop him!\\n\\nThree of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed\\naway in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the\\ndoor.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: RIDGE\\n\\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.\\n\\nHAN: Not bad for a little furball. There\\'s only\\none left. You stay here. We\\'ll take care of this.\\n\\nHan and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the\\nbunker. Threepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: I have decided that we shall stay here.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST===\\n\\nPaploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It\\'s\\nscary, but he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within\\nsight behind him and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he\\'s\\nhad enough. As he rounds a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs\\na vine and swings up into the trees. A moment later, the scouts\\ntear under him in pursuit of the still-flying, unoccupied bike.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: BUNKER\\n\\nHan sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on\\nthe shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into\\nthe arms of the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the\\nfront, and taps out a pattern on the bunker door\\'s control panel.\\nEveryone stands out of sight, police-style, as the door opens.\\nHan and Leia peek inside. No sign of life. The group enters the\\nbunker silently, leaving one lookout behind.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: DEATH STAR - EMPEROR\\'S THRONE ROOM===\\n\\nThe elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They\\nwalk across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and\\nson side by side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to\\nhis Master.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been\\nexpecting you.\\n\\nLuke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks\\ndown at Luke\\'s binders.\\n\\nEMPEROR: You no longer need those.\\n\\nThe Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke\\'s\\nbinders fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at\\nhis own hands, free now to reach out and grab the Emperor\\'s neck.\\nHe does nothing.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Guards, leave us.\\n\\nThe red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.\\n\\nEMPEROR: (to Luke) I\\'m looking forward to completing your\\ntraining. In time you will call me Master.\\n\\nLUKE: You\\'re gravely mistaken. You won\\'t convert me\\nas you did my father.\\n\\nThe Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to\\nLuke. The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time,\\nLuke can perceive the evil visage within the hood.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that\\nit is you who are mistaken...about a great many\\nthings.\\n\\nVADER: His lightsaber.\\n\\nVader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke\\'s\\nlightsaber. The Emperor takes it.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Ah, yes, a Jedi\\'s weapon. Much like your\\nfather\\'s. By now you must know your father can\\nnever be turned from the dark side. So will it be\\nwith you.\\n\\nLUKE: You\\'re wrong. Soon I\\'ll be dead...and you\\nwith me.\\n\\nThe Emperor laughs.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of\\nyour Rebel fleet.\\n\\nLuke looks up sharply.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Yes... I assure you we are quite safe from\\nyour friends here.\\n\\nVader looks at Luke.\\n\\nLUKE: Your overconfidence is your weakness.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Your faith in your friends is yours.\\n\\nVADER: It is pointless to resist, my son.\\n\\nThe Emperor turns to face Luke.\\n\\nEMPEROR: (angry) Everything that has transpired has\\ndone so according to my design. (indicates Endor) Your\\nfriends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...\\n\\nLuke reacts. The Emperor notes it.\\n\\nEMPEROR: (cont) ...are walking into a trap. As is your\\nRebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know\\nthe location of the shield generator. It is quite safe\\nfrom your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my\\nbest troops awaits them.\\n\\nLuke\\'s look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the\\nsword in the Emperor\\'s hand.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Oh... I\\'m afraid the deflector shield will be\\nquite operational when your friends arrive.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM===\\n\\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door\\nand enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel\\nprisoner.\\n\\nHAN: All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly!\\nQuickly, Chewie.\\n\\nThe Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their\\npanels. Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.\\n\\nLEIA: Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any\\nmoment.\\n\\nHAN: Charges! Come on, come on!\\n\\nOutside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more\\ncontrollers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards\\nat the door.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: (to Wicket) Oh, my! They\\'ll be captured!\\n\\nWicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam\\ninto the forest.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with\\nme.\\n\\nInside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an\\nImperial commander enters.\\n\\nCOMMANDER: Freeze!\\n\\nHan flings an unprimed charge at the commander, knocking over a\\nguardrail into the generator core. Another commander runs in\\naccompanied by stormtroopers.\\n\\nCOMMANDER #2: You Rebel scum!\\n\\nHan and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on\\nthem and their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops\\nsurround them. Even more pour into the room, roughly disarming\\nthe Rebel contingent. Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks.\\nThey\\'re helpless.\\n\\n== Part 5 ==\\n=== EXTERIOR: SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET ===\\n\\nThe Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as\\nthe Rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The\\nMillennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as\\nthe space armada bears down on its target.\\n\\nINTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the\\nradio.\\n\\nLANDO: All wings report in.\\n\\nWEDGE: Red Leader standing by.\\n\\nGRAY LEADER: Gray Leader standing by.\\n\\nGREEN LEADER: Green Leader standing by.\\n\\nWEDGE: Lock S-foils in attack positions.\\n\\nINTERIOR: REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\\n\\nFrom the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar\\nwatches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.\\n\\nACKBAR: May the Force be with us.\\n\\nINTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points\\nto the control panel and talks to Lando.\\n\\nLANDO: We\\'ve got to be able to get some kind of a\\nreading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could\\nthey be jamming us if they don\\'t know if we\\'re coming.\\n\\nLando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star\\nas the implications of what he\\'s just said sink in. He hits a\\nswitch on his comlink.\\n\\nLANDO: Break off the attack! The shield is still up.\\n\\nRED LEADER: (VO) I get no reading. Are you sure?\\n\\nLANDO: Pull up! All craft pull up!\\n\\nThe Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and\\nthe Death Star move off right.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD\\n\\nThe Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to\\navoid the unseen wall.\\n\\nINTERIOR: REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\\n\\nAlarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes\\ncourse abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the\\narmada tries to halt its forward momentum.\\n\\nACKBAR: Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close\\nto holding sector MV-7.\\n\\nA Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls\\nout to Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the\\ncontroller.\\n\\nCONTROLLER: Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.\\n\\nOn the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive\\nImperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.\\n\\nACKBAR: It\\'s a trap!\\n\\nLANDO: (over comlink) Fighters coming in.\\n\\nThere is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head\\ninto an armada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce\\ndogfight ensues in and around the giant Rebel cruisers.\\n\\nREBEL PILOT: There\\'s too many of them!\\n\\nLANDO: Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire\\naway from the cruisers.\\n\\nWEDGE: Copy, Gold Leader.\\n\\nThe battle continues around the giant cruisers.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DEATH STAR - EMPEROR\\'S THRONE ROOM\\n\\nThrough the round window behind the Emperor\\'s throne can be seen\\nthe distant flashes of the space battle in progress.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Come, boy. See for yourself.\\n\\nThe Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his\\nside. Luke moves to look through a small section of the window.\\n\\nEMPEROR: From here you will witness the final\\ndestruction of the Alliance, and the end of your\\ninsignificant Rebellion.\\n\\nLuke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the\\narmrest of the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles,\\ntouches the lightsaber.\\n\\nEMPEROR: You want this, don\\'t you? The hate is\\nswelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use\\nit. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give\\nin to your anger. With each passing moment, you\\nmake yourself more my servant.\\n\\nVader watches Luke in his agony.\\n\\nLUKE: No!\\n\\nEMPEROR: It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You,\\nlike your father, are now mine!\\n\\nEXTERIOR: FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\\n\\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of\\nthe bunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted\\nbefore, is now crowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and\\nhundreds of Imperial troops. The situation looks hopeless.\\n\\nSTORMTROOPER: All right, move it! I said move it!\\nGo on!\\n\\nFrom the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of\\nbeeps and whistles. And --\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking\\nfor me?\\n\\nBUNKER COMMANDER: Bring those two down here!\\n\\nSTORMTROOPER: Let\\'s go!\\n\\nArtoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six\\nImperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two\\ndroids duck out of sight behind the tree.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Well, they\\'re on their way. Artoo, are you\\nsure this was a good idea?\\n\\nSTORMTROOPER: Freeze! Don\\'t move!\\n\\nTHREEPIO: We surrender.\\n\\nThe stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids\\nwaiting quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do\\nthat, however, a band of Ewoks drops down from above and\\noverpowers them.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.\\n\\nIn a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds\\nthe EWOK ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks\\nthrow their fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled\\nstormtroopers and their awesome two-legged walkers.\\n\\nBiker scouts dart about blasting Ewoks, only to be crushed by a\\nvolley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the trees above.\\n\\nIn the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive\\nfor the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them.\\nHan goes to the bunker door control panel.\\n\\nLEIA: The code\\'s changed. We need Artoo!\\n\\nHAN: Here\\'s the terminal.\\n\\nLEIA: (into comlink) Artoo, where are you? We need\\nyou at the bunker right away.\\n\\nArtoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle rages\\naround them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a\\nseries of whistles and shoots off across the battlefield.\\nThreepio, panicked, runs after him.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Going? What do you mean, you\\'re going. But--\\nbut going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no\\ntime for heroics. Come back!\\n\\nBiker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away\\nat the little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.\\n\\nA group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position.\\nThey fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The\\nwalker turns and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both\\nguns. The Ewoks abandon their weapons and flee in all directions.\\nJust as the walker moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop\\nvines restraining two huge logs that swing down and smash the\\nwalker\\'s head flat.\\n\\nA line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a\\nwalker\\'s foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are\\ndragged behind.\\n\\nTwo speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the\\nscouts round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vine\\ntied between two trees.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE\\n\\nThe Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious\\ncombat with Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around the\\ncruisers of the Rebel armada.\\n\\nINTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other\\nRebel squads.\\n\\nLANDO: Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!\\n\\nWEDGE: Red Three, Red Two, pull in!\\n\\nRED TWO: Got it!\\n\\nRED THREE: Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!\\n\\nWEDGE: Cut to the left! I\\'ll take the leader!\\nThey\\'re heading for the medical frigate.\\n\\nLando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew\\nfires at the TIEs from the belly guns.\\n\\nNAVIGATOR: Pressure\\'s steady.\\n\\nThe copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.\\n\\nLANDO: Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder\\nwhat those Star Destroyers are waiting for.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET\\n\\nThe giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance\\nfrom the battle. The Emperor\\'s huge Super Star Destroyer rests in\\nthe middle of the fleet.\\n\\nINTERIOR: SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nAdmiral Piett and COMMANDER GHERANT watch the battle at the\\nhuge window of the Super Star Destroyer bridge. An officer\\nwalks up to them.\\n\\nOFFICER: We\\'re in attack position now, sir.\\n\\nPIETT: Hold here.\\n\\nGHERANT: We\\'re not going to attack?\\n\\nPIETT: I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He\\nhas something special planned for them. We only need\\nto keep them from escaping.\\n\\nINTERIOR: EMPEROR\\'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\\n\\nThe Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle\\nfireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel\\nship explodes against the protective shield.\\n\\nEMPEROR: As you can see, my young apprentice, your\\nfriends have failed. Now witness the firepower of\\nthis fully armed and operational battle station.\\n(into comlink) Fire at will, Commander.\\n\\nLuke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to\\nthe Rebel fleet beyond.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\\n\\nControllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod\\nstands over them.\\n\\nJERJERROD: Fire!\\n\\nINTERIOR: DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER\\n\\nA button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights.\\n\\nA hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A\\nhuge beam of light emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers\\nstand to one side at a control panel.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: DEATH STAR\\n\\nThe giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star\\nbegins to glow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the\\naerial battle.\\n\\n=== EXTERIOR: SPACE - AIR BATTLE ===\\n\\nThe air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings\\ndogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel\\ncruiser is hit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely by\\nseveral TIE fighters.\\n\\nINTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nThe ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel\\ncruiser. Lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the\\nDeath Star firepower.\\n\\nLANDO: That blast came from the Death Star! That\\nthing\\'s operational! (into comlink) Home One, this\\nis Gold Leader.\\n\\nINTERIOR: REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\\n\\nAckbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks\\ninto the comlink.\\n\\nACKBAR: We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.\\n\\nLANDO: They won\\'t get another chance at this,\\nAdmiral.\\n\\nACKBAR: We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our\\ncruisers can\\'t repel firepower of that magnitude.\\n\\nLANDO: Han will have that shield down. We\\'ve got to\\ngive him more time.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\\n\\nArtoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide\\ncover fire.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: We\\'re coming!\\n\\nHAN: Come on! Come on!\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, Artoo, hurry!\\n\\nThe little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer\\narm. A large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over\\nheels, finally landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid\\'s\\nhead is spinning and smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud\\nSPROOING and Han and Leia turn around to see Artoo with all his\\ncompartment doors open, and all of his appendages sticking out;\\nwater and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in his body. Han rushes\\nto the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded companion.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so\\nbrave?\\n\\nHAN: Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.\\n\\nLEIA: I\\'ll cover you.\\n\\nEwoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the\\nstormtroopers, dive-bombing their deadly adversaries. One is hit\\nin the wing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers\\nforward, shooting laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all\\ndirections. Two Ewoks are struck down by laser blasts. One\\ntries to awaken his friend, then realizes that he is dead.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE - DEATH STAR\\n\\nThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the\\nDeath Star\\'s deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging\\nImperial Star Destroyers.\\n\\nINTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\nLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of\\nfloating giants. He\\'s been yelling into the comlink.\\n\\nLANDO: (desperately) Yes! I said closer! Move as\\nclose as you can and engage those Star Destroyers\\nat point-blank range.\\n\\nACKBAR: At that close range, we won\\'t last long\\nagainst those Star Destroyers.\\n\\nLANDO: We\\'ll last longer then we will against that\\nDeath Star...and we might just take a few of them\\nwith us.\\n\\nThe Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star\\nDestroyers and begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny\\nfighters race across the giant surfaces, against a backdrop of\\nlaser fire.\\n\\nThe control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.\\n\\nREBEL PILOT: She\\'s gonna blow!\\n\\nY-WING PILOT: I\\'m hit!\\n\\nThe damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and\\ncrashes into the control tower, exploding.\\n\\nINTERIOR: EMPEROR\\'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\\n\\nOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is\\nbeing decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But\\nin here there is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the\\nEndor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my\\nyoung apprentice. The Alliance will die... as will\\nyour friends.\\n\\nLuke\\'s eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Good. I can feel your anger. I am\\ndefenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with\\nall your hatred, and your journey towards the dark\\nside will be complete.\\n\\nLuke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He\\nignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader\\'s\\nlightsaber flashes into view, blocking Luke\\'s blow before it can\\nreach the Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to\\nfight his father.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: FOREST\\n\\nThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with\\nsophisticated weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak\\nup behind the Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with\\nlarge clubs.\\n\\nA walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it\\ngoes. An Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut\\nloose. The logs tumble under the walker\\'s feet, causing it to\\nslip and slide until it finally topples over with a great crash.\\n\\nA scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The\\nother end of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings\\naround in ever-tightening circles until it runs out of rope and\\ncrashes into the trees with a huge explosion.\\n\\nChewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two\\nEwoks cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the\\nlurching machine, then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks\\npeeks through the window.\\n\\nWALKER PILOT #1: Look!\\n\\nPILOT #2: Get him off of there!\\n\\nThe walker pilot opens the hatch to see what\\'s going on. He is\\nyanked out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two\\nEwoks jump into the cockpit and knock the second pilot\\nunconscious. The Ewoks are thrown violently as the mighty machine\\ncareens out of control. Outside, Chewie is almost knocked\\noverboard; he sticks his head into the hatch with a series of\\nangry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to listen to\\nthe Wookiee\\'s complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.\\n\\nChewbacca\\'s walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts\\nat unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial\\nwalkers. The Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps\\nturn the tide of the battle in their favor.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\\n\\nHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he\\nattempts to hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting\\naway at some stormtroopers.\\n\\nHAN: I think I got it. I got it!\\n\\nThe three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD\\nWHOOSH, a second blast door crashes down in front of the first.\\n\\nHan frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges\\nshots with stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out\\nin pain, her shoulder hit by a laser blast.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?\\n\\nHAN: Let\\'s see.\\n\\nLEIA: It\\'s not bad.\\n\\nSTORMTROOPER: (OS) Freeze!\\n\\nThey freeze.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, dear.\\n\\nSTORMTROOPER: Don\\'t move!\\n\\nLeia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the\\ntwo stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia\\'s eyes lock;\\nthe moment seems suspended in time.\\n\\nHAN: I love you.\\n\\nAnother shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.\\n\\nLEIA: I know.\\n\\nSTORMTROOPER: Hands up! Stand up!\\n\\nHan stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia\\'s hand.\\nShe disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back\\ntoward Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand\\nbefore him, its deadly weapons aimed right at him.\\n\\nHAN: (to Leia) Stay back.\\n\\nThe hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head\\nout and barks triumphantly.\\n\\nHAN: Chewie! Get down here! She\\'s wounded! No,\\nwait... I got an idea.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: EMPEROR\\'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM===\\n\\nLuke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers\\neven more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi\\nhas grown stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts\\nto him. Vader is forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked\\ndown the stairs. Luke stands at the top of the stairs, ready to\\nattack.\\n\\nEMPEROR: (laughing) Good. Use your aggressive feelings,\\nboy! Let the hate flow through you.\\n\\nLuke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader,\\nand realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off\\nhis lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.\\n\\nVADER: Obi-Wan has taught you well.\\n\\nLUKE: I will not fight you, father.\\n\\nVader walks back up the stairs to Luke.\\n\\nVADER: You are unwise to lower your defenses.\\n\\nVader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi\\nleaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk\\noverhead. Vader stands below him.\\n\\nLUKE: Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the\\ngood in you... the conflict.\\n\\nVADER: There is no conflict.\\n\\nLUKE: You couldn\\'t bring yourself to kill me before,\\nand I don\\'t believe you\\'ll destroy me now.\\n\\nVADER: You underestimate the power of the dark side.\\nIf you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.\\n\\nVader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports\\nholding the catwalk, then returns to Vader\\'s hand. Luke tumbles\\nto the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under\\nthe Emperor\\'s platform. Vader moves to find him.\\n\\nEMPEROR: (laughs) Good. Good.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: SPACE - AIR BATTLE\\n\\nThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at\\neach other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star\\nDestroyer explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half\\nalive with a series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser\\nmanages to move in next to a second Star Destroyer before it\\nexplodes completely, taking the Imperial Star Destroyer with it.\\nThe Falcon and several fighters attack one of the larger Imperial\\nships.\\n\\nLANDO: Watch out. Squad at .06.\\n\\nREBEL PILOT: I\\'m on it, Gold Leader.\\n\\nWEDGE: Good shot, Red Two.\\n\\nLANDO: Now... come on, Han, old buddy. Don\\'t let me\\ndown.\\n\\nINTERIOR: BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM\\n\\nControllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of\\nan Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of\\nstatic and interference.\\n\\nHAN/PILOT: (VO) It\\'s over, Commander. The Rebels have\\nbeen routed. They\\'re fleeing into the woods. We need\\nreinforcements to continue the pursuit.\\n\\nThe controllers cheer.\\n\\nCONTROL ROOM COMMANDER: Send three squads to help.\\nOpen the back door.\\n\\nSECOND COMMANDER: Yes, sir.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER===\\n\\nAs the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out,\\nthey\\'re surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their\\nweapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on\\nthe roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns\\nas Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.\\n\\nINTERIOR: BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM\\n\\nHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and\\nplant explosive charges on the control panels and rush out.\\n\\nHAN: Throw me another charge.\\n\\nINTERIOR: EMPEROR\\'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\\n\\nVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the\\nthrone, searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber\\nheld ready.\\n\\nVADER: You cannot hide forever, Luke.\\n\\nLUKE: I will not fight you.\\n\\nVADER: Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only\\nway you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray\\nyou. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...\\n\\nVader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in\\nanguish.\\n\\nVADER: Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings\\nhave now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her\\nfrom me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn\\nto the dark side, then perhaps she will.\\n\\nLUKE: Never-r-r!\\n\\nLuke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at his\\nfather with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke\\nand Vader fight in the cramped area. Luke\\'s hatred forces Vader\\nto retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a\\nvast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke\\'s sword drives his\\nfather further toward defeat.\\n\\nThe Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword\\nto block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader\\'s right hand off\\nat the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the\\nmechanical stump. Vader\\'s sword clatters uselessly away, over the\\nedge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke\\nmoves over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark\\nLord\\'s throat. The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased\\nagitation.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now,\\nfulfill your destiny and take your father\\'s place at\\nmy side!\\n\\nLuke looks at his father\\'s mechanical hand, then to his own\\nmechanical, black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is\\nbecoming like his father. He makes the decision for which he\\nhas spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and hurls\\nhis lightsaber away.\\n\\nLUKE: Never! I\\'ll never turn to the dark side. You\\'ve\\nfailed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father\\nbefore me.\\n\\nThe Emperor\\'s glee turns to rage.\\n\\nEMPEROR: So be it...Jedi.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER\\n\\nHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race\\nacross the clearing.\\n\\nHAN: Move! Move!\\n\\nA shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by\\na spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish\\nexplodes along with the bunker.\\n\\nINTERIOR: REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\\n\\nAckbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.\\n\\nACKBAR: The shield is down! Commence attack on the\\nDeath Star\\'s main reactor.\\n\\nLANDO: We\\'re on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all\\nfighters follow me. (laughs) Told you they\\'d do it!\\n\\nThe Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads\\ntoward the unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.\\n\\nINTERIOR: EMPEROR\\'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM\\n\\nLuke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of the\\nstairs. The Emperor\\'s laughter has turned to anger. He raises his\\narms toward Luke.\\n\\nEMPEROR: If you will not be turned, you will be\\ndestroyed.\\n\\nBlinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the\\nEmperor\\'s hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi\\ntries to use the Force to deflect them. At first he is half\\nsuccessful, but after a moment the bolts of energy are coming\\nwith such speed and power the young Jedi shrinks before them, his\\nknees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to his feet, and\\nmoves to stand at his master\\'s side.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Young fool... only now, at the end, do you\\nunderstand.\\n\\nLuke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the\\nEmperor\\'s lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling\\ninto the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Your feeble skills are no match for the power\\nof the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack\\nof vision.\\n\\nLuke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up\\ntoward where Vader stands watching.\\n\\nLUKE: (groans) Father, please. Help me.\\n\\nAgain Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the\\nEmperor, then back to Luke on the floor.\\n\\nEMPEROR: Now, young Skywalker...you will die.\\n\\nAlthough it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of\\nbolts from the Emperor\\'s fingers actually increases in intensity,\\nthe sound screaming through the room. Luke\\'s body writhes in\\npain.\\n\\nVader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the\\nrobed figure despite the Dark Lord\\'s weakened body and gravely\\nweakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-\\nshooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white\\nlightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load\\nas the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black\\ncape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to\\nthe edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With\\none final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls\\nthe Emperor\\'s body into the bottomless shaft.\\n\\nThe Emperor\\'s body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it\\nfalls into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the\\nshaft, it explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.\\nVader\\'s cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers, and\\ncollapses toward the bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father\\'s\\nside and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety.\\nBoth the young Jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move.\\n\\nEXTERIOR/INTERIOR: - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR\\n\\nRebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death\\nStar to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the super-\\nstructure of the giant battle station, followed by many TIE\\nfighters.\\n\\nWEDGE: I\\'m going in.\\n\\nLANDO: Here goes nothing.\\n\\nThree X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft,\\nfollowed by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters\\nwho continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the\\npilot\\'s faces as they race through the dark shaft.\\n\\nLANDO: Now lock onto the strongest power source. It\\nshould be the power generator.\\n\\nWEDGE: Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of\\nspace real fast.\\n\\nThe fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still\\npursued by the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from\\nbehind and explodes.\\n\\nLANDO: Split up and head back to the surface. See if\\nyou can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.\\n\\nPILOT: Copy, Gold Leader.\\n\\nThe Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE\\'s, while\\nLando and Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and\\nthe Falcon scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters\\ncontinue to blast away at them.\\n\\nLANDO: That was too close.\\n\\nNien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet\\nrages on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star\\nDestroyer.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE===\\n\\nACKBAR: We\\'ve got to give those fighters more time.\\nConcentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.\\n\\nX-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.\\n\\nINTERIOR: VADER\\'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE\\n\\nAdmiral Piett and Commander Gherant stand at the window, looking out to\\nthe battle. They look concerned.\\n\\nCONTROLLER: Sir, we\\'ve lost our bridge deflector\\nshield.\\n\\nPIETT: Intensify the forward batteries. I don\\'t want\\nanything to get through.\\n\\nGherant is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel\\nfighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.\\n\\nPIETT: Intensify forward firepower!\\n\\nGHERANT: Too late!\\n\\nThe Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer,\\ncausing a huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control,\\ncrashes into the Death Star, and explodes.\\n\\nINTERIOR: REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE\\n\\nThere is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all\\nsides. They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.\\n\\nINTERIOR: DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY\\n\\nChaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions\\nas the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over,\\nunloading a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions,\\nconfused and desperate to escape.\\n\\nIn the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous\\ndeadweight of his father\\'s weakening body toward an Imperial\\nshuttle. Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions\\ngrow louder as Vader draws him closer.\\n\\nVADER: (a whisper) Luke, help me take this mask off.\\n\\nLUKE: But you\\'ll die.\\n\\nVADER: Nothing can stop that now. Just for once...\\nlet me look on you with my own eyes.\\n\\nSlowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father\\'s face.\\nThere beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus.\\nBut the dying man smiles at the sight before him.\\n\\nANAKIN: (very weak) Now... go, my son. Leave me.\\n\\nLUKE: No. You\\'re coming with me. I can\\'t leave you\\nhere. I\\'ve got to save you.\\n\\nANAKIN: You already have, Luke. You were right about\\nme. Tell your sister... you were right.\\n\\nLUKE: Father... I won\\'t leave you.\\n\\nDarth Vader, Anakin Skywalker... Luke\\'s father, dies.\\n\\nA huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and,\\nhalf carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles\\ntoward a shuttle.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: DEATH STAR\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the\\nimmense superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel\\nStar Cruisers outside continually bombard the huge station. And\\neach direct hit is answered by resonating, chain-reaction\\nexplosions within the station itself.\\n\\n\\n== Part 6 ==\\n===INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS===\\n\\nLando\\'s crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the\\ndashing Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main\\nreactor shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of\\nthe Falcon.\\n\\nWEDGE: There it is!\\n\\nLANDO: All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator\\non the north tower.\\n\\nWEDGE: Copy, Gold Leader. I\\'m already on my way out.\\n\\nThe X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires\\nseveral proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series\\nof small explosions.\\n\\nThe Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously\\nclose, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon\\nwith a powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main\\nreactor.\\n\\nHe maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just\\nahead of the continuing chain of explosions.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE===\\n\\nAckbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge,\\nwatching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main\\nbriefing room.\\n\\nACKBAR: Move the fleet away from the Death Star.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: DEATH STAR===\\n\\nAn Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out\\nof the main docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star\\nis blown away. But as Luke pilots toward the safety of the\\nSanctuary moon, his thoughts - enhanced by the Force - turn to\\nhis friends aboard the Millennium Falcon.\\n\\nThe Falcon flies at top speed, with a single X-wing as escort,\\nover the endless surface of the Death Star. A series of\\nexplosions within the superstructure follow, then swiftly\\novertake the small craft as it races for an exit.\\n\\n===INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT===\\n\\nLando turns to Nien Nunb and shakes his head.\\n\\nLANDO: (into comlink) Wedge, I don\\'t think we\\'re going\\nto make it.\\n\\nWEDGE: (VO) You\\'ll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader.\\n\\nLANDO: (to himself) I promised to return his ship\\nwithout a scratch... I sure hope that old pirate\\nforgives me. This is gonna be close.\\n\\nEXTERIOR: DEATH STAR\\n\\nAn X-wing, piloted by Wedge Antilles, races out of the exploding\\nsuperstructure and whizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon. But the\\nMillennium Falcon is not fast enough as it explodes with the\\nDeath Star in a supernova of glory.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: ENDOR FOREST===\\n\\nHan and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks\\nall look to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final\\nflash of self-destruction. All except Han cheer, as the thirty-\\nyear-old starship pilot feels a deep personal loss.\\n\\nHAN: (whispering to himself) Lando...\\n\\nTHREEPIO: (misinterpreting Han\\'s reference) They did it!\\n\\nHan looks down from the sky to Leia, a look of sorrow and regret\\non his face. He knows he will never see the Falcon and Lando\\nagain. His thoughts turn to Leia, as she continues to look\\nat the sky as though listening for a silent voice.\\n\\nHAN: I\\'m sure Luke wasn\\'t on that thing when it blew.\\n\\nLEIA: He wasn\\'t. I can feel it.\\n\\nHAN: You love him, don\\'t you?\\n\\nLeia smiles, puzzled.\\n\\nLEIA: Yes.\\n\\nHAN: All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won\\'t\\nget in the way.\\n\\nShe realizes his misunderstanding.\\n\\nLEIA: Oh. No, it\\'s not like that at all. He\\'s my brother.\\n\\nHan is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT===\\n\\nLuke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where\\nhis father\\'s armor lies; black mask, helmet and cape. He stands,\\nwatching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume what\\'s left\\nof Vader.\\n\\nIn the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above\\nthe forest.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY - SUNSET===\\n\\nFireworks explode above the city as searchlights pan the sky. A\\ntwin-pod cloud car zooms in above the festivities.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: TATOOINE - DAY===\\n\\nA skyhopper weaves around buildings as confetti falls over the city,\\nawash in celebration.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: CORUSCANT PLAZA - NIGHT===\\n\\nConfetti falls on the city as hundreds of citizens celebrate. An\\nairspeeder flies overhead. Fireworks explode in the full-moon sky.\\n\\n===EXTERIOR: EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT===\\n\\nA huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels\\nand Ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating,\\nsinging, dancing, and laughing in the communal language of\\nvictory and liberation.\\n\\nLando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie.\\nThen, finally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and\\nembrace him. They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort\\nin each other\\'s touch, together to the end.\\n\\nRebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The\\noriginal group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke\\nseems distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.\\n\\nHe looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling\\nfigures at the edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin\\nSkywalker.\\n\\nDISOLVE TO:\\n\\nEXTERIOR: GALAXY -- SPACE\\n\\nEND CREDITS OVER STARS\\n\\nTHE END\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Movies]]'}, 'Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens': {'transcript': '<p style=\"text-align:center;\">STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS</p>\\n\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Written by</p>\\n\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Lawrence Kasdan, J.J.

(CHOPPER GRUNTS) Everybody, huh? (PURRING) I won\\'t do it.\\nSo you do know what the darksaber is.\\nI know it caused my family nothing but trouble after Maul took it.\\nMaul used it to divide and conquer our people.\\nYou can wield it to do the opposite.\\nWield it? You\\'re crazy.\\nKanan, tell him he\\'s crazy.\\nConsider what he has to say.\\n- What? - What?

No.\\nAnd yet, you still won\\'t let her train with the darksaber.\\nLook, Sabine is a capable warrior.\\nIn some ways, more so than Ezra, but she can\\'t or won\\'t find balance within herself.\\nUntil she does, wielding an actual lightsaber is far too dangerous for her.\\nBy letting her pretend with that stick, you\\'re only encouraging her not to commit to this.\\nYou\\'re not listening to me.\\nIf I let her use the darksaber, she will get hurt.\\nShe\\'s already hurt.\\nHer family hurt her more than any sword could.\\nYou don\\'t see it because she doesn\\'t want you to.\\nBut you can? Because I know what it\\'s like when people you love don\\'t believe in you, when they let you walk away.\\nRemember how hard it was for her to trust us.\\n(SIGHS) Hmm.\\nSo what do you want me to do?

Look, we\\'re trying to fight the Empire, but we\\'re outnumbered, overmatched and taking a beating. We could use your help.\\n\\nRex: Well, I\\'m not sure I\\'m much help to anyone these days. Didn\\'t you hear? The Emperor said the clone army has outserved its purpose and retired us. Now we spend our days just telling stories and slinging for joopas.\\n\\nKanan: This was a wasted trip.

My days as a soldier are over.\\n\\nEzra: Well, okay. Okay, then maybe there\\'s one thing you can help us with. We need a base. Ahsoka said you knew about all sorts of secret locations in the Outer Rim.\\n\\nRex: Well, my memory isn\\'t what it once was, but, um, there are a few spots I never bothered to report to the Empire. Look, why don\\'t you wait outside and I\\'ll put together a list of coordinates.\\n\\nWolffe: Listen, they are in some kind of trouble. If we help them, we are putting ourselves in danger.\\n\\nGregor: Wolffe, relax. We got the situation under control.\\n\\nWolffe: Oh, really? Really? What do you think the Empire will do to us if they find out that we are helping a Jedi, hmm?\\n\\nGregor: Yeah, I don\\'t know what the Empire would do, but I\\'m going slinging. You know, I was thinking, since we\\'re providing you with a list of bases, um, there\\'s something you can do to help us.\\n\\nKanan: No, thanks.\\n\\nEzra: Sure.\\nWhat can we do?\\n\\nGregor: Out there, deep below, roam the joopa.

What?\\n\\nImperial Officer: Commander, we\\'ve received a binary transmission from an old clone unit on Seelos.

All leads must be pursued.\\n\\nEzra: Okay. You don\\'t trust these clones, but they haven\\'t done anything.\\n\\nKanan: You don\\'t understand. They\\'re dangerous. They could-\\n\\nEzra: They could what? Rex doesn\\'t seem bad at all. Ahsoka said to trust him. You trust her, don\\'t you?\\n\\nKanan: You weren\\'t there. You weren\\'t even born.\\n\\nEzra: What are you talking about?\\n\\nKanan: I don\\'t feel like discussing it. It was at the end, the end of the war. Our fellow soldiers, the clones, the ones we Jedi fought side by side with, suddenly turned and betrayed us. I watched them kill my master. She fought beside them for years, and they gunned her down in a second, and then came for me. Later they said they had chips in their heads that made them do it. Said they had no choice.\\n\\nRex: I didn\\'t betray my Jedi. Wolffe, Gregor and I all removed our control chips. We all have a choice.\\n\\nEzra: Well, for what it\\'s worth, I believe we can trust Rex.\\n\\nGregor: If we\\'re lucky, we\\'ll catch Big Bongo today.\\n\\nZeb: Let\\'s get this over with.

But really, I mean, joopa supposedly love Lasats.\\n\\nSabine: They love them? What do you mean?\\n\\nGregor: Well, they say they love the smell, or I guess they love the taste as well. And maybe it\\'s about the texture. You know...\\n\\nEzra: Wait, Zeb\\'s not the hunter. He\\'s the bait.\\n\\nGregor: Oh, hunter, bait, it\\'s all the same.\\n\\nKanan: No, it\\'s not! Zeb, you better get back here right now! \\n\\nSabine: Zeb, what is that?\\n\\nEzra: Buddy, run! You\\'re the bait!

This could be him! Our Big Bongo! \\n\\nRex: Hey, I bet you know a thing or two about mechanics.\\n\\nSabine: Yeah, good bet.\\n\\nRex: Keep an eye on this regulator. The line can overheat and shut down. No line, no joopa, no Zeb.\\n\\nSabine: Got it.\\n\\nEzra: Well, what about me and him? \\n\\nGregor: You got the best job of all! When the line swings around, you\\'ll charge it with the electro-poles. Hit the line with the rod, and it\\'ll send a bolt of energy down to the joopa. Do it enough, and you should bring it up to the surface.\\n\\nGregor: Here\\'s one for you, General.\\n\\nKanan: Don\\'t call me that. I was never a general.\\n\\nGregor: Uh, my mistake. Sorry, Commander.\\n\\nKanan: No, it\\'s not...\\n\\nRex: Hit it! Now!\\n\\nGregor: That\\'s it! That\\'s it! Ooh! He didn\\'t like that! Hit him again!\\n\\nRex: He\\'s a runnin\\'. Hit that line! Bring him up.\\n\\nSabine: We\\'re losing the regulator.\\n\\nRex: Full stop, Wolffe! Dig in! This is where we finish the battle!\\n\\nEzra: Whoa! I can\\'t reach it! Kanan, lift me up! Sabine!\\n\\nSabine: I know, I know. Working on it! Got it. \\n\\nKanan: Ezra? Go!\\n\\nGregor: It is Big Bongo!\\n\\nZeb: What a smell.\\n\\nEzra: Ah, Zeb!\\n\\nSabine: Nice catch, old-timers.\\n\\nGregor: Yeah! Way to go. Now that, that was impressive.\\n\\nKanan: Impressive? You almost got my friend eaten!\\n\\nZeb: Yeah. Ugh.\\nI was in that thing\\'s mouth!\\n\\nGregor: Oh! Head to toe. But look at you. You brought in our biggest catch ever.\\n\\nZeb: I I did? Actually, it wasn\\'t so bad, Kanan. I I knew I had the beast from the beginning.\\n\\nRex: And you are a natural. \\n\\nKanan: We held up our end of the deal, Captain. Now it\\'s time to get us those coordinates so we can go.\\n\\nRex: I\\'ll get \\'em. But you might consider staying for dinner.\\n\\nGregor: It\\'s gonna be delicious! \\n\\nZeb: That thing tried to eat me. Only fair I get to see how it tastes.\\n\\nEzra: Can\\'t say no to that. Right, Kanan?\\n\\nHera: Clones, huh? Ahsoka\\'s always full of surprises.\\n\\nKanan: Well, don\\'t get your hopes up. The great leader\\'s not coming back with us.\\n\\nHera: And you don\\'t want him to. I understand your fears, but I also remember when the Jedi and clones fought side by side. They saved billions of lives, including my own.\\n\\nKanan: I know.\\n\\nHera: Then maybe that\\'s a start. I gotta get back to these repairs if we\\'re ever gonna get out of this system. Signal when you\\'re en route.\\n\\nRex: I\\'ve assembled a list of potential bases and clearance codes and a few protocols the Imperials still use. Should be of some use.\\n\\nEzra: Thanks, Rex.\\n\\nRex: They\\'re on our main computer. You\\'re gonna need-\\n\\nSabine: Data tapes? I got this.\\n\\nRex: You were brave today, kid. You jumped right in there to help. A great Jedi once told me that the best leaders lead by example. You do that well.\\n\\nEzra: Thanks. I\\'ve learned from a great Jedi too. Kanan.\\n\\nRex: Mmm. You know, I don\\'t think he likes me. Or ever will. Can\\'t say I blame him. The war left its scars on all of us.\\n\\nEzra: Won\\'t you reconsider joining us?\\n\\nRex: You know, I\\'ve outserved my purpose for that kind of fighting, I\\'m afraid. After the war, I questioned the point of the whole thing. All those men died, and for what?\\n\\nEzra: I guess what they thought was right.\\n\\nSabine: The clones gave us up. They warned the Empire we\\'re here.\\n\\nRex: Wait, what? You\\'re mistaken. We would never do that.\\n\\nSabine: Oh, I found the binary transmission to the Empire. And there are messages Ahsoka sent to Rex, and he never answered her!\\n\\nRex: What? I never got any messages from Commander Tano.\\n\\nKanan: I knew it! I told you, they can\\'t be trusted.\\n\\nEzra: Kanan, wait. Is this true?\\n\\nRex: Wolffe. What did you do?\\n\\nWolffe: I I contacted the Empire. If they found out that we were helping Jedi, they\\'d wipe us out.\\n\\nKanan: Sabine, go warn Hera. Tell her to scan for incoming ships.\\n\\nWolffe: I wanted to protect you guys, protect our squad.\\n\\nRex: The war is over. We are free men. We can\\'t live under the fear of the Empire for the rest of our lives, Wolffe. That\\'s not freedom.\\n\\nWolffe: You\\'re right. They\\'re not our enemy. I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nSabine: A probe? Kanan!\\n\\nGregor: Oh, my. Look out!\\n\\nZeb: Probes! I hate probes! Whoa!\\n\\nEzra: Rex. You gotta make this right. Yes!\\n\\nSabine: Huh. Nice shot.\\n\\nGregor: Whoo-hoo-hoo!

There's nothing we can do.\\nIt's over.\\n(ENGINES WHOOSHING) (WIND WHISTLING) You didn't prepare me for this, Kanan.\\nWhat do I do now? (SNARLING) I guess you know about Kanan too, then? You.\\n(BARKS) Whoa! What's wrong? There was nothing I could do! (BARKS) (YELPS) (GROWLING) I don't know what you want! (BARKS) (SNARLING) (BARKS) (BARKS) (THUNDER RUMBLING IN DISTANCE) (LOW GROWLING) (SNARLING) (THUNDER CRASHING) (GROWLS AND BARKS) (GRUNTS) (LOW GROWLING) So you lost Hera Syndulla, yet you hold a parade.\\nExplain yourself, Governor Pryce.\\nA celebration of our victory over the rebels, Grand Admiral.\\nAs for General Syndulla, I have something better.\\nAh, it's true then.\\nBut the Jedi's death came at a cost, did it not? Did you really believe that holding a parade would hide the fact that you destroyed our entire fuel supply? In defeating Kanan Jarrus, you have accomplished what the rebels failed to, and given them a victory.\\nThe operation on Lothal, my TIE defender project, has been compromised.\\nUh, Grand Admiral, I I will deal with you when I return, Governor.\\nWith their leader gone, the remaining rebels will flounder, the boy especially.\\nUse that against them, Rukh.\\nExpect them to strike out recklessly.\\nAnd when they do, eliminate them.\\n(HOLOGRAM WARBLES) Why did I wait so long to tell him? I just I thought there would be more time.\\n(SIGHS) (SOBBING QUIETLY) (GRUNTING) You don't understand! If I had listened to Kanan, he would be alive.\\nHe said starting a war was a mistake, and he was right.\\nHe was right, and now, he's gone.\\nAnd it's my fault.\\nI was the one who was blind.\\n(GRUNTING) The Kalikori? Kanan found it.\\nIn the middle of everything else going on, he knew how much this meant to me.\\nHe rescued me and my family history.\\n(GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) You're right.\\nNo one deserves that honor more than Kanan.\\nSo, what do you see? Well, the parade has begun.\\nBut look at it, Zeb.\\nLook how many people there are.\\nLook how much the Empire has grown.\\nIsn't that why we're here? To reduce their numbers? (SCOFFS SOFTLY) We couldn't beat them with the help of the Rebel Alliance.\\nAnd there are so few of us left.\\nI mean, how can we beat them now? (GROANS) You don't see anything strange about the city? Uh, besides the refinery being on fire? ZEB: The factories aren't belching smoke.\\nWhen was the last time you saw them shut down? Never, but that's probably just because of the parade.\\nThe Empire doesn't give days off, Sabine.\\nHuh.\\nNow that is interesting.\\nAh! What happened? I know you're out there! Show yourselves! I better get back to base while I can.\\nHuh? (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (EXHALES) (CRACKS KNUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) I needed that.\\n(BEEPING) Connecting to the Imperial network in three, two, one.\\n(BEEPING) I'm in.\\nSo? The TIE defender factory was shut down.\\nIt took serious damage when the fuel depot blew up.\\nZeb, Kanan didn't just save us.\\nHe completed the mission.\\nThen why is the Empire celebrating? I'll bet because Pryce doesn't want anyone to know.\\nInstead of admitting we hurt them She sent all their workers to a parade.\\nSo, what's next? The Empire and us, we're not even yet.\\nI lived on this planet my whole life, and I can still get lost? I have no idea which way to go.\\nLoth-rat, Loth-cat, Loth-wolf, run.\\nPick a path and all is done.\\nNo.\\nLoth-rat, Loth-cat, Loth-wolf, run.\\nPick a path and all is done.\\n(RUKH SNIFFING) Ahh! (GASPS) Sorry, uh, sir, I was attacked.\\nIt was so fast, like a blur.\\n(GROANS) - Be silent.\\n- Sir? (BEEPS) Uh, this comm has been tampered with.\\n(BEEPING) (DEVICE WHIRRING) Hmm, that was fast.\\n(CHUCKLES) Well, you wanted to send a message.\\nI can do better than Wait.\\nWhat is that? What is what? Let me see.\\n(GROANS) Looks like a baby rancor.\\nWait a minute.\\nEzra told us about that thing.\\nYou're right.\\nI remember now.\\nWhen we were recovering the hyperdrive, that thing came sniffling over to us.\\nZEB: Ah! It looked right at me! Did it see you? I don't know! Well, look and see.\\nI don't want to.\\nIt's got creepy eyes.\\nOh, give me those.\\nOh, boy, it's coming this way.\\nWhat? Let me see.\\nUgh.\\nYou're right.\\nAnd the closer it gets, the uglier it gets.\\n- But - But what? At least it's alone.\\nWhat do you mean? I mean, we can even the score.\\nThey took Kanan from us.\\nWe take something from them.\\nI agree with you, only because we can't let it track us back to base.\\nNow, since we outnumber it, let's use that to our advantage.\\n(ENGINES WHIRRING) (WIND WHISTLING) (SNIFFING) Kanan? (SNARLS SOFTLY) Ah! (SNARLING SOFTLY) Who are you? I Am Dume.\\n(ENGINES WHIRRING) (GRUNTS) SABINE: We're not in the mood for a fair fight today.\\nNeither am I.\\n(DEVICE WARBLES) (BLOW LANDS) (GRUNTS) (WHOOSHING) (BLOWS LANDING) (GRUNTS) I can't see him.\\nScanning.\\n(BEEPING) (GROANS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (SNARLING) Dume.\\nThat was my master's name.\\nWhat do you want from me? You ran.\\nYeah, the wolves were chasing me! Why? (STAMMERING) I didn't mean to run, I just I feel lost without my master.\\nHe was wise and brave.\\nAnd he cared.\\nHe was there for me when no one else was.\\nThere was so much more I needed to learn from him.\\n(EXHALES) Fear.\\nI am afraid! All right? I'm afraid.\\nEverything seems so hopeless now.\\n(EXHALES) Fight.\\nHow? Together.\\n(WOLF SNARLING) (GROWLS) (STONE CLANKS) This stone.\\nWhere's it from? Jedi Temple.\\n(BLOW LANDS) (WHOOSHING) (GRUNTING) (BEEPS) (WHIRRING) Can you see him now? (CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah.\\n(RUKH GROANS) (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) - (GRUNTING) This Is - Zeb, stop! For Kanan! (PANTING) Zeb, Zeb! Stop! I thought you wanted to get even.\\nI do, but this isn't how we do it.\\nBut what are we gonna do with him now? I've got an idea.\\nWe accidentally led the Empire to the Jedi temple.\\nWe escaped, but they captured it.\\nDanger.\\nWell, then the Empire's still there! Secrets within.\\nSecrets? What secrets? What else is inside the temple? Knowledge.\\nDestruction.\\nAhsoka said we'd find knowledge in the Sith temple on Malachor.\\nBut we were wrong.\\nThat's when everything changed.\\n- Restore - (BARKS) Past.\\nRedeem Future.\\nHow? How do I do this? Tell me.\\n(SNARLING) No, no.\\n(ROARS) Kanan! (WIND WHISTLING) I always liked your art.\\nThanks.\\n(ENGINES WHIRRING) I think this is the best message we can send to the Empire right now.\\nHey, you set the homing beacon, right? Yeah.\\nWell, I think I did.\\n- Zeb.\\n- No, I did.\\n- I did.\\n- Unbelievable.\\nDid you just see how much I worked on that thing? For Kanan, so he'll always be remembered as a part of my family.\\nYou know, Chop, despite all his misgivings about the rebellion, he always believed we could change things.\\n(GRUNTING) That's what I'll miss the most, that when none of us could find the answer, Kanan could, and always in the most unexpected way.\\nHera? Hera? Was your mission a success? No, but yours was.\\nThe TIE defender factories have shut down.\\nWe didn't fail, Hera.\\nKanan made sure of it.\\nIn their attempt to destroy us, the Empire blew up their own refinery.\\nThey have no fuel for the factories.\\nTheir entire production line has stopped.\\nThen we have a chance.\\nWe can still beat them.\\nEZRA: And I know what our first mission is.\\nThe Jedi temple is in danger.\\nAnd we're the only ones who can do anything about it.\\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels Transcripts]]\"}, 'The Occupation': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels Transcripts]]'}, 'Zero Hour': {'wikicontent': 'Governor Pryce, I bring urgent news.\\nOf course.\\nRight this way.\\n(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING) (BEEPS) (BEEPS) Is all this secrecy truly necessary, Grand Admiral?

I believe they\\'re about to strike our most important facility in the region.\\nThe TIE defender factory right here on Lothal.\\nMy spies report General Dodonna\\'s fleet is en route to reinforce Commander Sato and Captain Syndulla.\\nWhere is this fleet massing? I have yet to uncover its precise location.\\nA coordinated attack by multiple rebel cells is unprecedented.\\nAnd it\\'s exactly this moment I\\'ve been waiting for to wipe them out.\\nI want you to capture their leadership.\\nIn such a battle, it may not be possible to take prisoners.\\nAh, but a man of your talents will manage.\\nIf we are to crush this rebellion, we must make examples of its leaders.\\nAs you wish, Governor Tarkin.\\n(ELECTRONIC WARBLE) EZRA: She did it.\\nHera really did it.\\nLook at everyone.\\nI can\\'t believe they\\'re all gonna help Lothal.\\n- It wasn\\'t just Hera.\\n- Oh, I know.\\nYou, too, Kanan.\\nAnd Zeb and Sabine.\\nChopper less so.\\n(CHUCKLES) No.\\nThat\\'s not what I meant.\\nI meant you.\\nKanan, I I didn\\'t do any of this.\\nIf not for you guys, I\\'d be back on Lothal, just waiting to be rescued like everyone else.\\nEzra, you have never been like everyone else.\\nHera always saw something special in you, and so did I.\\nAt times, I was afraid.\\nAfraid that I couldn\\'t teach you everything you needed to know.\\nBut you did.\\nI\\'ve learned so much.\\nAnd so have I.\\nWe all have.\\nIn fact, sometimes I wonder if I have anything left to teach you.\\nNo.\\nThat can\\'t be true.\\nMy own Jedi training was limited.\\nI don\\'t mean about the Force.\\nI mean about life, about being a good person.\\nThat\\'s what you\\'ve taught me.\\nHey, you two.\\nThe time to talk is over.\\nLet\\'s help out.\\nGeneral Dodonna and the Massassi group will be here any minute.\\nGeneral Dodonna? That name sounds familiar.\\nIt should.\\nHe got those Y-wing bombers we stole.\\nHe commands one of the largest rebel cells I know of.\\nWith him and his fleet, we have a real shot at taking out the Imperial factories on Lothal.\\nCommander Sato, there are several ships emerging from hyperspace.\\nAt last, General Dodonna\\'s fleet has arrived.\\nCOMMANDER SATO: Phoenix Nest to Vanguard.\\n- Welcome to Atollon, General Dodonna.\\n- Thank you, Commander Sato.\\nThis day has been a long time coming.\\nHopefully, we can finally deal a blow to the Empire and show the rest of the galaxy what we\\'re capable of.\\n(BIKE ENGINE HUMMING) (BEEPS) This is Fulcrum with an urgent message.\\nThrawn knows about (STATIC BUZZING) \"By the light of Lothal\\'s moons.\\n\" That is your code phrase, isn\\'t it, Agent Kallus?

You see, you are good.\\nThis is why I prefer to do business with the Empire.\\nWhat is your name?

Imploded star cluster, biggest one I've ever seen.\\nNice save.\\nIf we get any closer, the gravity field will destroy us.\\nWhat happened? Are we on course? Sure are, but our course is blocked by the worst kind of space anomaly we could've encountered.\\nThis is what happens when we jump into uncharted space.\\nAh.\\nThis is the maze that was prophesized.\\nWait, a maze? You never said anything about a maze.\\nYou prophecy types always pull something like this.\\nUgh.\\nNow what? Attention, rebels.\\nAs much as I might like to watch you consumed by the maelstrom before you, I will offer you a chance to surrender, an opportunity for survival.\\nHow did he find us? - Hello, my friends! - Hondo? What are you doing with him? I must apologize, Ezra.\\nI hid a tracker on that transmitter.\\nYou know, for insurance purposes.\\nWell, thanks a lot, Hondo.\\nYou've been a great help today.\\nYou have one minute to prepare for boarding, or to be destroyed.\\nI can't believe this.\\nKallus has got us.\\nHe plays his part, as warrior.\\nWait, he is the warrior? And I got stuck being the child? There are many warriors, fools and children, Captain.\\nThe child in you can't see how things are, but how they can be.\\nThe fool denies his destiny, but it is the warrior you are who will create one.\\nYou are never one of these.\\nIn time, you become all of them.\\nEzra, bring me my bo-rifle.\\nWhat are you thinkin', buddy? You can do this, Zeb.\\nI know it.\\nJust like the ancients used it.\\nYour time is up, rebels.\\nZeb, what are you doing? Leading the way.\\nZeb!

To their destruction.\\nLet them go.\\nPull back, full retreat.\\n- Yes, you'll get them next time.\\n- No.\\nI will watch them be destroyed.\\nI see it! The way through! I don't know how, but the hyperdrive is activating.\\nOw! Was that really necessary? Zeb! Get him up.\\nCaptain Orrelios! Hey, buddy.\\nYou hurt? I've had worse.\\nI've never seen better.\\nWe're home.\\nLira San.\\nZeb has been down there a while.\\nAre you sure he's coming back? Pretty sure.\\nYou were right.\\nWell, I'm sorry, Chopper.\\nYou're gonna have to put all of Zeb's stuff back in his room.\\nKinda sad, those two Lasat all alone on that planet.\\nThey're not alone.\\nWhat are you talking about? There were already Lasat down there.\\nLira San is where my people originally came from.\\nYes, Chopper, that means there's a lot more of him.\\nYes.\\nWe can go home now.\\nYeah.\\nHow do we get home?

This is a pirate our rebels rescued from Naraka prison, Hondo Ohnaka.\\nWithin the last hour, the Phoenix Squadron destroyed Mining Guild ships using the Sereeda Hyperspace Waypoint.\\nTaken separately, they may seem unrelated, but Ohnaka\\'s cellmate was a laborer at our starfighter reclamation plant in the Yarma system, one jump point away from the Sereeda attack.\\nGrand Admiral Thrawn believes the rebels intend to raid the plant and steal fighters for their fleet.\\nEvery ship they add to their arsenal increases the threat to our own armada and the Emperor\\'s plans.\\nI trust you have a solution? I will start my operations here and pull the rebels apart piece by piece.\\nThey will be the architects of their own destruction.\\nNo Imperial traffic on the scopes, but no sign of the station either.\\nIt is down there, my friends.\\nAnd those ships are ripe for plunder.\\nThere\\'s no telling what we\\'re flying into.\\nLet\\'s find out.\\nTake us down.\\nThere it is.\\nReklam Station.\\nChopper, get a count on those bombers.\\n(SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE) EZRA: There! Y-wing light bombers.\\nLooks like they\\'re in decent shape, too.\\nYeah, but according to Chopper\\'s scan, there\\'s only 15 left.\\nCorrection.\\nThere are only 14 left.\\nLooks like they\\'re being destroyed.\\nWe need to move in now.\\nThere won\\'t be any ships left if we wait.\\nHold on.\\nOur orders are to recon the station, not go after ships.\\nWe should advise Captain Syndulla.\\nWhat if the Empire detects our transmission? I was given command of this assignment.\\nI know what the objective was and I am changing it.\\nWe\\'re going in now.\\nThat\\'s an order.\\nYes, sir.\\nHurry! We\\'re losing ships.\\nWell, Lieutenant, what\\'s your plan to get \\'em out of there? - Here\\'s what we\\'re gonna do - Look out! What was that? Oh, right, right.\\nThat is probably a dismantler droid.\\nForgot that Terba said there might be some guarding the station.\\nWhen were you gonna share that information? Well, of course I just did.\\nCommander Titus, we have a perimeter breach.\\nDismantler droids have been activated.\\nIt could be the rebels Governor Pryce warned us about.\\n(WARBLING) Chop, get it! (SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE) (CHUCKLING) Right, I\\'ll handle those clankers.\\n- Hold on tight! - Where are you going? Outside.\\n(WARBLING) (GRUNTS) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) We\\'re going down! (ALARM BEEPING) Chopper, get the engines back online! (SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE) The rebel ship has suffered considerable damage.\\nThey\\'ve lost power.\\nWhere\\'d they go? We\\'ve lost them in the storm, sir.\\nBye-bye.\\nBrace yourselves! I\\'m gonna lock onto the station.\\nSir, the rebel ship is not registering on our scanners.\\nIt may have crashed onto the surface.\\nAlert the Imperial sector fleet.\\nGovernor Pryce will want to know of this.\\nWe gotta shut down the conveyor before they\\'re all slagged.\\nCome on.\\n(SPEAKING UGNESE) Ugnaughts! (SPEAKING UGNESE) Get out of the way.\\nI don\\'t want to hurt you.\\nWait, wait, wait, wait.\\nEvery situation has the potential to be profitable.\\n(CLEARS THROAT) (SPEAKING UGNESE) Terba (UGNESE CONTINUES) - (CHATTERING IN UGNESE) - Yes, yes, yes.\\nI told them Terba was my friend and we\\'ve come to liberate them.\\nI think that\\'s what I said.\\n\"Liberate them\"? Fine.\\nThey can help us liberate the ships.\\nHondo, get them to shut off the conveyor.\\nUh, very well.\\n(CLEARS THROAT) (CONVERSING IN UGNESE) (ALARM BEEPS) Laborer 429, why have you disengaged the conveyor? (SPEAKING UGNESE) It\\'s malfunctioning? Well, get it repaired, miscreant, or I\\'ll have you thrown off the station! Let\\'s just get our ships and get out of here.\\nWell, Lieutenant, first we have to refuel them.\\nTheir tanks will be empty.\\nBet you didn\\'t think of that when we walked into this.\\nNot the first complication.\\nWon\\'t be the last.\\nLet\\'s get to work.\\nYou know, Kanan would\\'ve loved this mission.\\nKANAN: So, tell me, how do I restore my sight? You must be empty.\\nThere is only the Force.\\nNow, turn and walk forward.\\nI\\'m not sure this is such a good idea.\\nAnd why not? Because those spiders are out there, waiting.\\nHow do you know this? (SIGHS) I hear them.\\nGood.\\nKeep walking.\\nSound relates them to you.\\nWhat else? I can feel them in the ground, their vibrations when they move.\\nIndeed, you are perceptive.\\nAre they close? No.\\nContinue on then.\\nHow else do you relate to the spiders? Before, in the caves, a foul smell.\\nIt was old, decayed.\\nAh, a fascinating description.\\nYou see much for being blind.\\nWell, I know what they look like.\\nI saw them when I had my sight.\\nThen picture them in your mind.\\nAre they close? - No.\\n- Are you certain? (HISSING) What should I do? What do you want to do? Hmm? Run.\\n(SIGHS) But there\\'s another one right behind me.\\nYou are beginning to see.\\nHa! Now, be empty and continue onward.\\nWhy aren\\'t they attacking? It is not in their nature.\\nWell, it has been, in my experience.\\nBecause you do not see them.\\n- You mean, see them for what they are? - Look closer.\\nHmm.\\nThere\\'s nothing.\\nI can\\'t sense them.\\nLook within.\\nI see Fear.\\nIn the spiders? Ezra! Ah, your thoughts dwell on your apprentice.\\nHe\\'s in danger.\\n(HISSING) No! No.\\nIt\\'s not Ezra or the spiders.\\nIt\\'s It\\'s me.\\nFear, grief, anger, that\\'s how they see me.\\n(SIGHS) That\\'s how I see myself.\\nAh, your sight returns.\\n(CHUCKLES) I distanced myself from everyone.\\nFrom the Force too.\\nYour connection to the Force allows you to see in ways others cannot.\\nIf you can see yourself, you will never be truly blind, Kanan Jarrus, Jedi Knight.\\nI understand.\\nWhere are you going? Ezra needs me.\\nThey all do.\\nWhat of the spiders? (CHUCKLES) I can see them, so there\\'s nothing to fear.\\nAnd what of this, hmm? Keep it, as a gift.\\nOh.\\n(CHUCKLING) (WHIRRING) SABINE: Last two, and then we\\'re outta here.\\nSir, the rebels, they\\'re alive and they\\'re trying to refuel the old bombers.\\nGet a squad down there.\\nOverride the conveyor and activate the magnetic locks.\\nUgh.\\nWell, they know we\\'re here.\\nThey\\'re locking the ships down.\\nUh, perhaps my associates can assist? (CONVERSING IN UGNESE) (SIGHS) My friend says all systems have been overridden by the control tower.\\n(SIGHS) Zeb, you and Sabine finish refueling.\\nI\\'ll take care of the tower.\\nRex, you\\'re with me.\\n(SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE) Stop your complaining.\\nThis is the last one.\\nThen we\\'ll leave.\\n(STARTLED CHATTERING) (SHOUTING, POWERING DOWN) (WARBLING) (SHOUTS) Zeb!

I got this.\\nYes, yes, you go help them.\\nWe will look for a ship.\\nI mean, help Ezra.\\nHERA: (ON COMLINK) Ghost to Spectre-6.\\nYou missed check-in.\\nWhere are you? Hey! Still in the Yarma system, Hera.\\nYeah, no.\\nGetting some great recon.\\nSo busy.\\nNo time to talk.\\nBridger out.\\nIt appears Commander Bridger\\'s recon mission has turned into a recovery operation.\\n- Sir, we had better mobilize the fleet.\\n- Indeed.\\nKanan? Ezra\\'s in trouble.\\nLet\\'s go.\\n(SIGHS) It\\'s good to have you back.\\nOh! You want some more, you lousy clanker? I\\'ll show you more! (GRUNTING) That tears it! Get off! (SHRIEKS) - Rex! - Rex! Partner! I will stay here and guard the shuttle in case we need a quick escape.\\nYou do that.\\nI assure you, Governor, we will capture these rebels momentarily.\\nI hope so, Titus, but know I will be there soon to reinforce you.\\n- You? - You? Last time we met, you were captain of a top-secret Star Destroyer.\\nNow you run a junkyard? Your capture and execution will mean my return to ranking status.\\nYeah, get ready for another demotion.\\nI\\'m asking nicely.\\nUnlock those bombers now.\\nSorry, but I\\'ve sabotaged the control unit.\\nThe only way to unlock the bombers is to cut power to the entire station.\\n- Okay.\\n- Wait! If you disable the power, this station will drop to a fiery destruction.\\nYou would doom us and your friends for a few old ships? I believe in my friends.\\nThey\\'ll be fine.\\nYou, not so much.\\n(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Better get going.\\nEvacuate now! The bombers are unlocked.\\nSpectre-5 to Spectre-6.\\nWhat was that blast? EZRA: I had to cut the station\\'s power.\\nGet in those bombers and get out of here! What about you? EZRA: I\\'ll take the Phantom.\\nNow get going.\\nThat\\'s an order! Chopper, tap into the relay navigation system.\\nI need you to remote-pilot those four ships.\\n(SPEAKING DROID LANGUAGE) Yes, you\\'re getting in a Y-wing too.\\n(COMPLAINING IN DROID LANGUAGE) Zeb! - Come on! Get in there! - (CHATTERING IN DROID LANGUAGE) Hondo, I thought you were guarding the shuttle in case we needed to escape.\\nAnd I am.\\nWe are making our quick escape now.\\nOr at least Hondo is.\\nI will see you again soon, partner!

I don\\'t understand.\\nI know you don\\'t, but rest assured, Thrawn has a much larger objective in mind than the capture of a single rebel cell.\\nI can explain everything.\\nSave it.\\nCommander Sato, everyone is accounted for.\\nGet us out of here!

If a comet hits, this ship has escape pods.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': That\\'s not exactly the kind of \"wrong\" I had in mind.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Good to see you again, Azmorigan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': I have what you ordered. Mmm, mmm. What do you have to offer in return?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Her name is Hera.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': [Gasps]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What? You can\\'t do this!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Trust me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Hera!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': A deal\\'s a deal, Kanan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': [Grumbling] Well, her attire is, uh, preposterous, but the trade is, uh, mmm is acceptable.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Thank you, Lord Calrissian, for delivering me to my new master. I must find a way to repay you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Please don\\'t let it concern you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': Enough prattle. Eh, you disturb my supper. [Belches] Uh, take your cargo and go.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': As always, Azmorigan, a pleasure doing business with you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Where\\'s Hera?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Tell her about Hera, Lando.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Hera is following the plan, which is what we should be doing if we want to get her back.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Where\\'s Hera?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What plan is she following?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': I told her to take an escape pod.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You never told her that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': I did, actually. Weren\\'t you paying attention? Besides, Hera strikes me as very capable. We are lucky to have a captain like her.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I know that. Wait. What do you mean, \"we\"?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Quite a day you\\'re having. First, you lose Chopper, now Hera.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What\\'s in here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Sophisticated mining equipment.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Puffer pig\\'\\'\\': [Snorting]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Uh, sounds like your sophisticated mining equipment is snoring.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Just don\\'t open the box. And whatever you do, keep it calm.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid Language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': Ah. [Smacking] [Slurping] [Hawks, Spits] You need food?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I seem to have lost my appetite. But perhaps you\\'d like me to serve you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Good practice for you. Uh, serve me, serve me. [Stammering] Be quick about it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': And perhaps you \\'d prefer to dine alone?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': Mmm. Oh, yes. Go, go. Leave us. Beat it!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Take the whole tray.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': What are you talking about? [Thump] [Gasps] [Groans]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': The master desires a little more alone time while I change clothes in my quarters. [Thump] That was a really useful tray.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': That Twi\\'lek\\'s my property, and I want my property back here now!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': In a pod, as discussed. You really should have more faith in our captain.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Our captain?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Um, we\\'ll go prep the airlock. [On Comm] Kanan, Hera\\'s aboard.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': [On Comm] We should probably make ourselves scarce.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Somebody should.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': You played that perfectly. Thank you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Oh, you\\'re welcome.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': [Coughing] I deserved that. But can we get back to the job at hand flying us past the Imperial blockade Otherwise, I don\\'t have to pay you or give your droid back.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': What was in that crate?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Come on. I\\'ll show you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Calrissian said not to open it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Yes. [Chuckles] He did. [Grunts]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Puffer pig\\'\\'\\': [Snorting]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Uh, kinda cute, whatever it is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Sniffing]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Puffer pig\\'\\'\\': [Squealing]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Catch it!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Puffer pig\\'\\'\\': [Squealing] [Snorts]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': That\\'s what was in the crate. Grab that puffer-pig, but don\\'t scare her.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Got her!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': You\\'re scaring her! I told you not to scare her.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I\\'m not scaring her! Karabast!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Whoa.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Whoa!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': You see? You scared her.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What is going on out here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': It\\'s a, um, puffer--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t want to know. We\\'ve reached the blockade. I could really use Hera on this side of the pig right about now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Yeah, I don\\'t see that happening.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Any idea what the Imperials are hoping to find with this blockade?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Rebels?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Besides that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Unauthorized mining equipment, perhaps.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': And why would they be looking for that?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Maybe because I tried smuggling some here a week ago. Don\\'t worry. The Imperials are scanning for equipment, machinery. But our girl here is Their scanners won\\'t detect her, so long as your ship can mask its signature.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You know it can\\'t until you ask Chopper to fix it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': [Laughing] You\\'re catching on. All right, my little friend. Would you like to be a hero and fix it for me?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid Language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Scanning Technician\\'\\'\\': Admiral. This Corellian ship matches the description of the rebel craft we\\'ve been looking for.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Okay, signature modulator\\'s back online. And just in time.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': No. Its signature reads the freighter Tontine, authorized for travel between Boz Pity and Lothal. Tontine, prepare for scanning.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Sabine, once we get back to Lothal, I\\'d love to purchase some of your art.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Really? My work. You\\'d pay?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Oh, he\\'ll pay.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': Scans clear, Tontine. You may proceed.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': We\\'re gonna make it!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Grunting]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Puffer pig\\'\\'\\': [Squealing]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Kid, not a good idea.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Scanning Technician\\'\\'\\': The signature was masked. That\\'s the rebel ship!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': All ships open fire!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Uh, Kanan, when they shoot at us, Hera usually shoots back.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Yeah, well, I\\'m not Hera, and I\\'m having enough trouble just keeping ahead of these guys.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': [On Comm] Cloud cover!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Find some.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Oh. Right. Good call, Hera. I think we\\'re in the clear. You know, your job\\'s a lot harder than it looks.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Nice. He finally appreciates you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': All right. Enough with the divide and conquer. You think by setting us against each other, you\\'ll keep us off-balance enough to get what you want? But what you want depends on my crew working together in sync. Is that clear?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': As crystal, Captain.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Grunts] A little help? This time, try to keep it calm.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': We don\\'t want you inflating it again.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Hey, it wasn\\'t my fault.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': This is your land?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Bought if off a charming fellow named Vizago.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Perfect. But why was it so important to get this pig here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Because a puffer-pig has a nose for precious minerals. It can do the job of a dozen mining scanners.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': And the Empire doesn\\'t want private landholders mining Lothal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': We\\'re done here. Pay us, and we\\'ll be on our way.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': He has other debts to pay.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Azmorigan?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': Did you forget I introduced you to Vizago, huh? I knew where you were headed.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': But your ship You couldn\\'t have hidden it anywhere close. Did you walk here? You don\\'t walk anywhere.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': Well, I do what\\'s necessary to claim my property, Calrissian.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': What do you want?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': My demands are simple. I want my pig back and you. Plus this ship and this crew as compensation for my sore feet. But first first, I want to bury Calrissian.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Yeah, yeah, I understand the feeling. But no.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Now, wait. Let\\'s consider that last demand for a sec.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': [Grumbling] I\\'ve run out of patience! Get them!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Get back!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Chopper, don\\'t hide there! It\\'s a fuel canister!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No lightsabers, not unless we\\'re--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You worry too much.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Hey, mine doesn\\'t do that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Nope. I might not be able to sword fight yet, but I can shoot.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Kid, you continue to impress.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Nice shot, Lando!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yeah, just not as much as Lando.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Grumbling] [Grunting, Chittering]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Puffer pig\\'\\'\\': [Squeals] [Squealing]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Zeb. The pig! Scare it!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': What? How?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Just be you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Puffer pig\\'\\'\\': [Squealing]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Hey, pig!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Puffer pig\\'\\'\\': [Screeches]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': [Shouts] [Squeals]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid Language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': You\\'re welcome! [Groans]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': New terms: I get Calrissian, and this one lives. I get Calrissian, and you all can go free.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You got it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Deal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': It\\'s tempting, but the answer\\'s still \"no.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid Language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Yelps] Whoa!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Chatters]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': My terms: You and your men leave now, and we let you live. Start walking.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Azmorigan\\'\\'\\': [Whimpering]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': I like everything that just happened except that you let Azmorigan live. That\\'ll be a problem for me later.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I think you have a problem now. You don\\'t have the credits you owe us, do you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': But I will once my baby\\'s worked her magic.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You mean, if she finds what you\\'re looking for and you\\'ve mined and smuggled it off world?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': I can give you back your droid.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Chattering]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': That won\\'t satisfy your debt to me. Not after what you pulled.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Then how about we settle that debt with a little game of sabacc?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Then you\\'ll just have to owe me one.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Don\\'t worry, my small metal friend. We shall meet again.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Angry Grunt]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Oh, come on. I saved your circuits. Isn\\'t that apology enough?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Blows Raspberry]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': So that\\'s it? We just walk away without the creds?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Well, we got Chopper back.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I\\'m looking for a positive here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': There are a lot of things we couldn\\'t accomplish without him. You should appreciate that more.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I always appreciated you, Sabine.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Yes, Ezra, I know.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Course, we still need food and fuel.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Hoots]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Oh, hey, Chopper stole Lando\\'s fuel! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': You mean he was playing Lando the whole time? Good job, Chopper.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Whooping]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Anyone that fools Lando is okay with me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lando\\'\\'\\': Of course I knew they took the fuel. That\\'s why I didn\\'t pay them. A gambler never shows his cards.

If we could get inside the docking bay, I could rig something, black \\'em out. But our transport ship\\'s not gonna fit in there.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We need something small enough to get into that hangar bay.

For Kanan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': (Sighs) Fine.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': What\\'s going on?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': The TIE we stole a while back, we, uh-- we didn\\'t exactly crash it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': And by \"didn\\'t exactly, \" you mean--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We didn\\'t crash it.

It\\'s some of my work.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': It\\'ll have to do.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I thought you were supposed to be the same one. This whole plan is as crazy as those colors.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Maybe you\\'re right. Maybe this mission doesn\\'t make military sense. But Kanan is family.

And id I did, I\\'d rather give my life than tell you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': So heroic. Just like your master. Tell me, Jedi, how did you survive Order 66, hmm? It was your Master Billaba who laid down her life for yours. Do you remember her last word to you, her last and final breath before she died? You do, don\\'t you? You see it in your sleep. You hear her voice when you wake. Tell me, Jedi, what was her last word to you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Run.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': And does your loyal and precious crew... know you ran as your master fell, abandoned her and the Jedi Order... when they needed you most? What do you think your rebels would do... if they know their leader was a coward? You\\'re even afraid of your own power. You don\\'t have the courage to wear your full saber out in the open. Let me tell you something, Jedi. You\\'re right to be afraid. You couldn\\'t save your master then, and you can\\'t save your followers now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I\\'ll send in our transporter code as soon as we know Kanan is there.

In fact, you have.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtroopers\\'\\'\\': (Grunting, Screaming)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I hope Ezra\\'s found Kanan by now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Let me borrow that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yeah, no problem.

That was a mistake.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Why? Because you have no one left to die for you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No. Because I have nothing left to fear.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': The other troopers are waking up.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': That puts twice as many between us and Chopper.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I think I have an alternate plan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': All right.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Here\\'s part one. Part two, we go to Bay 5.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Huh. Where your masterpiece is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': That\\'s got nothing to do with it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Ezra, we\\'re finding another way out. Ezra? Can you hear me? Ezra.

But now I know there\\'s something stronger than fear-- fat stronger. The force. Let me show you how strong is. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': You have no idea what you\\'ve unleashed here today. There are some things far more frightening than death. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Kanan. Kanan. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I thought I lost you. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I know the feeling. Let\\'s go home.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Imperial Offcier\\'\\'\\': There\\'s damage to the power core. The hyperdrive\\'s outheating. We can\\'t hold the ship. We need to evacuate, sir.

Go!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We\\'re not leaving without you and Kanan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (On Comlink) Will you just listen to the kid? Don\\'t worry. I\\'ve got him.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You mean, I\\'ve got you. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (On Comlink) You take care of Zeb and Sabine. I\\'ll get him out of here. Trust me. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': We had to take the TIE that has a bull\\'s-eye painted on it! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Spectre-3, we\\'re gonna need to get out of here fast. Send a signal so we can link up for hyperspace. Do you read? Chopper\\'s not answering. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': The Inquisitor\\'s TIE. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, we know he\\'s not gonna use it. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You know what, kid? You worry me sometimes. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I can\\'t believe that bucket of bolts abandoned us. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We got your back.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Thanks. But without Chopper\\'s transport, we\\'re going nowhere fast. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We got TIEs closing in. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': We\\'re in a bit of a tight spot. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Yeah? Well, these things weren\\'t built for three. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I meant out there, not in here!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Trying to concentrate!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I just want to say it was really nice getting to know all of you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Droid Language: Fanfare)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Chopper! He came back. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Who-- Who is that?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t know, but I think they\\'re on our side. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Kanan, Ezra, dock with Chopper\\'s transport so we can make the jump into hyperspace. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Imperial Officer\\'\\'\\': The rebels have escaped, sir. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I owe you all a great debt of gratitude. Even if what you did was rash and reckless. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You\\'re welcome, dear.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Complaining)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': If Chopper was in this transport ship, then who was flying the Ghost? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Senator Organa\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) Hello, my friend. It is good to see you again.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t understand. I met you once for a few moments. I don\\'t even know your name.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': His name is Senator Bail Organa.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': And the crews of the blockade runners?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Senator Organa\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) Members of other rebel cells. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': There are other cells.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We\\'re a cell? Wait. Did you know we were a cell?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Um, no. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We weren\\'t supposed to meet. That way, if captured, we couldn\\'t reveal the other rebels to the Empire. That was the protocol.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka Tano\\'\\'\\': The protocol has changed. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Fulcrum.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka Tano\\'\\'\\': Ahsoka. My name is Ahsoka Tano.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Why did you come here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka Tano\\'\\'\\': Because of you and your apprentice, many in this system and beyond have heard your message. You gave them hope in their darkest times. We didn\\'t want that hope to die. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': So what happens now?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka Tano\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t know. One chapter has closed for you, Ezra Bridger. This is a new day. A new beginning.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': We are getting reports of unrest all over Lothal.

For missing training.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': It\\'s all the same thing. The fact that you don\\'t see it-- [Sighs] Ezra, when we were on that asteroid, you made a dangerous connection through the Force. Now I have to know if you are ready.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I am ready. Wait. Ready for what?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': For a test, a real challenge one that could determine if you\\'re meant to be a Jedi or not.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': But you said I was a Jedi. Why else would you be training me?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I never said you were a Jedi. I said you had the potential to become one. But you lack discipline, focus.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Come on. You know how I grew up. I\\'m not used to all these rules. Kanan, I want to become the Jedi you see in me, the one I don\\'t always see in myself.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] You\\'re lucky I\\'m not my Master. She\\'d never let you get away with--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': All the things you tried to get away with?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You want a second chance or not?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I mean, if you want to give me one--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I\\'m not giving you anything. Now go prep the Phantom.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': As you say, Master.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Ah, I might regret this.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You have to do this, Kanan. After what happened on the asteroid, you have to help him.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I hope I can.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I know you can.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': So, where are we headed for this test?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': That\\'s what you\\'re gonna tell me. When I was your age, there were around 10,000 Jedi Knights defending the galaxy. Now, we are few. But in those days, we had small outposts, temples spread throughout the stars. The Empire sought out these temples and destroyed many of them, but not all. I want you to meditate, let the Force guide you to one of them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What if I can\\'t find it?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': That\\'s part of the test. Trust yourself. Trust the Force.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Exhales] So, did you take this test at my age?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] It was different for me, Ezra. Everything was different back then. All that remains now is the Force.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': And only my connection to the Force can lead me to the temple.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Chuckles] He can be taught.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': There\\'s a massive stone with a tunnel, I think and a bright star inside of it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You sure?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I can\\'t give you the coordinates, but I can direct us there. I know I can. The stone from my vision.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Autopilot disengaged.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You already knew.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I checked the holocron back in my cabin.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': And it told you there was a Jedi temple on Lothal?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': The holocron holds extensive star maps, but I was as surprised as you that there was a temple here. Course, I couldn\\'t be sure this is where you were meant to be, but it makes sense. This is your home. You better figure out how we get inside. And don\\'t take too long. Remember, the Empire has access to all the old Jedi records. They may know about this temple and have it under surveillance.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Nothing. No sign of an entrance. Not even a crack. But I know this is the place.\\nI feel it. Seriously, can\\'t you give me a hint?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Don\\'t look! Listen. Use the Force to hear the stone and its story.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': The stone. The temple. It It wants to admit me. No. Wait, not me. Us. Master and Padawan. Together.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Then together it shall be.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Whoa.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Don\\'t lose focus. We don\\'t want this thing crashing down on us.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Gasps] [Screams] [Gasps]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You lost focus.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, dead guys are distracting.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': In here, you\\'ll have to face your worst fears and overcome them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I have plenty of faith. Faith you\\'ll keep me on track.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I\\'m not going with you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What? Where are you gonna be?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Right here, with them Masters whose Padawans never returned.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You\\'re putting your life in my hands? You put your training in mine.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] Good luck.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Wait. What exactly am I looking for?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Nothing and everything.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': That doesn\\'t help.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I know. But that\\'s what my Master told me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Scoffs] Great. Should\\'ve brought the holocron. Loth-rat, Loth-cat, Loth-wolf, run.

Knew there was a reason you were being so nice to him.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': That\\'s pretty cold, guys. After all, he\\'s just a little kid scared, alone. Me? I pity him.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Well, look who\\'s here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': How long do you think he was listening?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Long enough. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Eh Nothing personal, kid.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': No. This isn\\'t you talking. I\\'m not back on the Ghost. I couldn\\'t be.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Well, that\\'s just crazy talk. You\\'re standing here, aren\\'t you? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': No. I\\'m back in the temple--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Loud Groan]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\':  No. No, this isn\\'t real.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': [Screaming]*\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Ezra. Wait! Help us! [Screaming]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Gasps] [Screaming] No! [Groans, Panting] That\\'s right. I\\'m in the temple. I knew it. Kanan? Kanan, where are you? No. He died! The Inquisitor killed him! Or Or-Or was that an illusion too? Either way, I\\'m trapped. No way I get this open on my own. I\\'m alone, abandoned again. Again Yeah. Been alone before. Survived. I can survive this. Maybe Kanan\\'s not dead. Maybe he\\'s just injured. He might need my help in there.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': How perceptive.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': No, no, no, no, no, no! You were on the Ghost, and that all that that was definitely an illusion.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': It may have been, but I assure you, I am not. No way out, Padawan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': There\\'s always a way out-- if I follow my training.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Ready to die, boy, or are you afraid to face your demise?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': No. Afraid of being alone again? Sure. Afraid of letting down my Master? Absolutely.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Your Master lies dead and rotting in a forgotten tunnel. You could hardly have let him down more.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I\\'m not afraid.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': [Shouts]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Big fears have you faced, young one.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yes.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Hmm. For what lies ahead, ready are you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I am.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Come. See more clearly what you could not see before.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Who are you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': A guide.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Groans] The kid\\'s taking too long.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Patience. Remember you nothing of your own training?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Master Yoda! [Sighs] It can\\'t be. I\\'m losing it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Losing? Lost. Yes. But what loss, hmm? The question, that is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Master? How How can this be?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Be not concerned with how. Know I am here because you are here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Thank you, Master.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Thank you? Hmm. Nothing have I done. Hmm. See you, I can. Before, I could not.\\nChanged, something has.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I\\'ve taken on an apprentice.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Apprentice? Hmm. And now Master are you? Of this decision, honest you must be.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] It\\'s true. I\\'m not sure of my decision to train Ezra. Not because of him or his abilities because of me, because of who I am.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Which way is the right way?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': The wrong question, that is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I\\'m sorry. I don\\'t understand. To be honest, I don\\'t even know what I\\'m doing here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\':  [Chuckles] A better question, that is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Kanan said I was gonna be tested, but he never said what for or why.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': And your Master tell you everything, must he? Your path you must decide. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well No.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': A dangerous time this is for your apprentice, for you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I know. I can sense it. I feel as if his abilities are growing faster than I can teach him.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': You sense, or you fear?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] I lost my way for a long time, but now I have a chance to change things.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Hmm. Last chance.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I won\\'t let him lose his way, not like I did.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Whoa.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Tell me. Why must you become Jedi? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t know. I guess because Kanan believes I can.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Ah. Kanan thinks you can. Hmm. And you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, I\\'ll become stronger, powerful.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Ah. Power you seek.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I\\'d make the Empire suffer for everything it did, for everything it took, for my parents! I I wouldn\\'t be helpless anymore!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Ah. Jedi way is revenge? Teach you this, your Master did?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\':  No. Kanan would never. He\\'s a good Master, a-a great Master.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Then why seek you revenge?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Hmm. Inside you much anger, much fear.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I just want to protect myself and my friends.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': And this is why you must be Jedi? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yes, and not just them. Everyone. I\\'ll protect everyone. Before I met Kanan, I only ever thought of myself, but Kanan and the rest, they don\\'t think like that. They help people, they give everything away, and I see it. I see how it makes people feel.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Feel, yes. How? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Alive. They feel alive, like I do now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Good. Good. Ahead of you a difficult path there is, Padawan. A Jedi you may yet be.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': How are you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Different, but the same.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Chuckles] I know what you mean.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I found this.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t believe it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What is it? It\\'s good, right? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Ezra, that\\'s a kyber crystal!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Oh. Wow. What\\'s a kyber crystal?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': It\\'s a lightsaber crystal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': (Gasps)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I have to admit, when I brought you here, I didn\\'t see this happening. Getting a lightsaber crystal is a big step.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': It\\'s strange that it\\'s just here. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': And it will be, for now, and hopefully it\\'ll be here long after you and I are gone.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I was just thinking shouldn\\'t we use it as a base or something? Who knows what else is in there?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I know what\\'s in there. The past.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': He\\'s been working on that thing for weeks. What kind of lightsaber could he possibly build with the junk we have laying around? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Well, I had a few spare parts I found over the years.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': And I had some bits and pieces that might work modulation circuits, an energy gate. Chopper even donated a power cell.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Droid Language)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I gave him some additional tech. He was pretty specific about what he was looking for.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Exhales] \\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': [Gasps] \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I thought I\\'d let you check it out first.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Well, it\\'s different. But that seems about right for you.

anything.\\n\\nNow, I could have killed Damien Darhk before that night at Iron Heights.\\n\\nI had multiple chances to do so, and I didn\\'t, because I thought that taking the high road was more important than saving lives, and that is a mistake that I will never, ever make again.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t call not killing people a mistake, Ollie--\\n\\nI would, because when I did take Darhk down for good, I had to confront the fact that Malcolm Merlyn was right.\\n\\nEither I\\'m willing to do whatever is necessary, or I shouldn\\'t be out there at all.\\n\\nWhich is exactly why I can\\'t be.\\n\\nI won\\'t ever again.\\n\\nThea.\\n\\nNo, I--\\n\\nOllie, I am sorry, but I want to honor Laurel just as much as you do, just not like this, and I don\\'t care what your reasons are, putting killing back on the table is a huge step backwards, and I don\\'t want anything to do with it.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry that you had to hear that.\\n\\nHazard of the job.\\n\\nAre you ok?\\n\\nJust seeing

you ask me to put more people in the crosshairs?\\n\\nI am not the one who is asking, or do you not remember the promise that you made to Laurel before she died?\\n\\nLaurel was thinking about the

trying?\\n\\nBecause second much more likely.\\n\\nOk, Anatoly, you just need to tell me if you can get me close to him.\\n\\nKovar has army, government soldiers.\\n\\nHe\\'s very dangerous.\\n\\nYou

I\\'d like to know why we\\'re relying on intel from this Fulcrum, whoever he is.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan:\\'\\'\\' It\\'s Hera\\'s job to find missions that create problems for the Empire and profit for us. If she trusts the contact, I trust the contact. No questions asked.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' At the Imperial Academy they didn\\'t want me to ask questions either. That didn\\'t work for me. That\\'s why I ended up here.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan:\\'\\'\\' And we\\'re glad to have you.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' You are so frustrating.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan:\\'\\'\\' Yeah, I\\'ve heard that before.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Fine. I\\'m done asking questions. I\\'m telling you: I\\'m coming on your run to meet Fulcrum.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' You know, you can be pretty frustrating too.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Learned from the best.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' This diagnostic\\'s taking forever. How\\'s it going in there? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' Hera was right. Steering\\'s definitely out of whack. But I almost got it fixed.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' There we go. Life support filters need cleansing. Chopper, as soon as Ezra\\'s out of the repair duct, purge \\'em.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' All fixed! Whoa! Hey! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Perfect. Steering and life support are back in working order. Nice work. Sorry, kid. I told him to wait till you were out.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' Not funny.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Hold it. We\\'re not done here. The diagnostic\\'s still running. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' You can run a diagnostic on Chopper when I\\'m done with him.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Come back here, you little monongs! Gotcha.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' I take it you\\'ve finished the repairs? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' Uh, you were right. The steering needed fixing, which I did.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' And life support filters needed purging, which we also did. Chopper! I\\'m gonna \"dismantalate\" that nut bucket!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' \\xc2\\xa0Leave a few bolts for me.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Let\\'s go.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' So what\\'s the deal? Is Fulcrum just another smuggler like Vizago? Why all the secrecy?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Oh. It\\'s no secret we\\'re fighting against the Empire. We need as many allies as we can get.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' How do you find a way of answering questions without giving any answers? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Do you really want me to answer that? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Fulcrum:\\'\\'\\' Phantom, this is Fulcrum. Come in.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' This is Specter-2, Fulcrum.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Why don\\'t I talk to him? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Don\\'t you dare.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Fulcrum:\\'\\'\\' Already at the rendezvous, Specter-2. Supplies are unloaded and ready. Should I wait? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Yeah, stick around. Specter-2 and I would love to talk to you.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Fulcrum:\\'\\'\\' Specter-2, what\\'s the problem? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' No problem, Fulcrum. Specter-5 decided to help with the supply run.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Fulcrum:\\'\\'\\' Understood. Fulcrum out.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' You know, an outburst like that is not appreciated.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Neither is all this secrecy.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' So, where\\'s the mystery man? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' I don\\'t know. Maybe Fulcrum didn\\'t like your attitude. I know I didn\\'t. I\\'ll take that one.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Look, Hera, I\\'m sorry for the attitude. It\\'s just things seem to be getting more dangerous every day, and I need to know that you and Kanan can trust me.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' We trust you, Sabine. We just can\\'t tell you everything. It\\'s for the safety of the whole crew. If captured, you can\\'t reveal what you don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' You think I\\'d talk? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' I think we think the Imperials can make anyone talk. You\\'ve seen what they\\'re capable of.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Yeah, I have. That\\'s why I need to know.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' You already know exactly what you need to know and no more. I need you to trust me now.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' And that\\'s supposed to make me feel better? Hera, you know what happened when I was a cadet at the Imperial Academy on Mandalore. I trusted the Empire, followed its orders blindly, and it was a nightmare. I want to believe we\\'re doing good, making a difference. But sometimes it seems like the harder we fight, the harder things get out there. I feel like we can\\'t take down the Empire on our own. That\\'s why I need to know this isn\\'t all for nothing. I need to know that I am not walking into another nightmare here.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' What you need is faith. Faith that there is a long-term plan that\\'s bigger than you or me, bigger than Lothal, bigger than the entire Outer Rim. Have faith in that and in us. We--Kanan--He knows what he\\'s doing.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Hera. Look.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' There were more crates, but someone\\'s dragged them away.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Maybe he\\'s still here.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Who? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Fulcrum? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' No.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Well, who else knows about this place? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Not sure. This base was abandoned years ago, after the Clone Wars. Besides, why drag them? Why not use the anti-grav? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Whoa. Sunrise comes along fast in these parts.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Let\\'s see what else comes along.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Whoever did this must have been pretty eager to get what was inside.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Too eager to just flip the latch and open them? Who would-- we\\'re not dealing with a who. \\xc2\\xa0More like a what.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' That\\'s comforting. You don\\'t happen to know why this base was abandoned? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' I\\'m starting to have my suspicions. Sabine, run! Whatever those creatures are, they can\\'t take the sun.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Good, but do you see the size of that asteroid? That\\'s going to block out the sun for a long time.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' How long? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' \\xc2\\xa0I don\\'t know. Long enough for us to become lunch.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Luckily we weren\\'t planning on staying. All right. Let\\'s get to work.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Last one.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Good. Let\\'s go. No, no, no, no, no! We had nearly a full tank when we landed. Now we\\'re out of fuel? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' Hera\\'s not here to save you now. Whoa! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' That\\'s it!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Specter-2 to Specter-4. Come in. Specter-2 to Specter-4. Come in! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Go ahead, Specter-2.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' You did run a full diagnostic on the Phantom, correct? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Of course.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' And you checked the results? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Um, Specter-2, there might be a small problem with the fuel line.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Small problem? Uh, guys, we have a situation.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' This is your fault, you and Chopper! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' You were the one running the diagnostic. You should have checked.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' I\\'ll check you into the wall.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' We have to tell Kanan. But don\\'t tell him it\\'s our fault.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Okay.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' Kanan.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Kanan.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan:\\'\\'\\' Hera and Sabine are in danger.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' Wow. How could you tell? Could you sense it? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan:\\'\\'\\' No. I could hear you two yelling outside the door. We\\'re on our way. Ghost out.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' No way they get here before that asteroid blocks the sun and - I guess we could hole up in the Phantom? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Judging by the torn-up shuttle in there, locking ourselves in the Phantom won\\'t protect us. Could get grim.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Well, I\\'ll take grim right now. Thought I recognized these markings. Allow me to introduce you to one of my oldest and most explosive friends: rhydonium.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' It\\'s good to have friends.So what\\'s your plan? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Since we don\\'t know how many of those creatures are in there, we can set up groups of canisters and create explosions that take them out a wave at a time.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' How will you get the creatures close enough to the rhydonium to be effective? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' We\\'re gonna need bait.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Where do we get that? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' We don\\'t get it. We are it.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Wave one. Move.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Wow. A lot of \\'em.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Steady now. Follow the plan. Fall back! Wave two. Wait for \\'em. Now! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' It worked. We just might survive this.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Wait. You doubted your own plan? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Never.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Good, \\'cause I sure did.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Hey! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Come on. They\\'re closing in. Wave three. Wave four. Incoming! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Oh. Did I mention there are a lot of \\'em? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Sounds familiar. Light it up. Coming in from both sides.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' What about wave five? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' We didn\\'t have a plan for wave five.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Afraid of that. The Phantom? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Not inside. Go up top.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' They just keep coming! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Tell me something I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' We\\'re going to die.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' That\\'s no secret.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' The light\\'s not hurting them.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Then we better move.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' Sabine! I got your back. These guys aren\\'t so tough. Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Karabast! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Kid, come on! \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Nice moves out there, champ. Chopper! Close her up! No hitchhikers! Kanan, we\\'re all aboard.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan:\\'\\'\\' Something\\'s wrong. She\\'s not responding.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Rerouting auxiliary power to the hull.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan:\\'\\'\\' Didn\\'t know the Ghost could do that.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' There\\'s a lot you don\\'t know about my ship. Chopper, reroute coolant to the engine.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' Thanks for saving me back there.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Don\\'t read too much into it, kid.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Engaging magnetic lock.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Look, Hera, I\\'m sorry about not checking the diagnostic.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra:\\'\\'\\' We\\'re all sorry. Right, Chopper? Anyway, we\\'ll fix the Phantom.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb:\\'\\'\\' Don\\'t even worry about it.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Now, why would I worry? \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' Mmm. Maybe because the last time they \"fixed\" it, \\xc2\\xa0we nearly wound up as lunch?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Oh, right. That\\'s why. Sabine, I know you have questions, questions I can\\'t answer right now. But know that I trust you. I just trusted you with my life down there.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine:\\'\\'\\' I know. I know you do.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera:\\'\\'\\' Good. We are making a difference, Sabine. And I promise: we won\\'t always be fighting this battle alone.

That was easy.\\n Nice going, partner.\\n Looks like you got us captured.\\n It would be nice if we had some backup! Uh, just a thought, but why don\\'t we just call it even and go through with the original deal? Sounds good, yes? I appreciate your offer, humbly, but I don\\'t think you\\'re gonna be around to collect.\\n Azmorigan, take the fruits of our labor, if you must.\\n That I understand.\\n But this? Is it necessary? Oh, yes.\\n You see, the Rang Clan has a nice bounty on your head.\\n I\\'ll collect on these generators and make an additional profit from your death.\\n Your business plan is impressive.\\n Of course, it is.\\n It\\'s mine.\\n Uh Who is this? Hey.\\n Hey.\\n I know you From somewhere.\\n Calrissian\\'s farm on Lothal! Well, of course, you know him.\\n This is my longtime friend, Lando Calrissian.\\n What? No, he\\'s not Calrissian!

Oh.\\n Well, that was easy.\\n Very good.\\n Now! My friend, my friend.\\n You might not be Calrissian, but I know one thing you are You are a Jedi.\\n Why didn\\'t you tell me you were a Jedi? You know, I am an old Jedi sympathizer.\\n I know.\\n I wouldn\\'t believe me either, but one of my best friends was a Jedi.\\n I\\'m pretty sure we were friends.\\n Well, I\\'m not really a Jedi yet.\\n Well, then be a pirate Jedi! We will make an excellent team.\\n But first, tell me, what is your name? Your real name.\\n - Ezra Bridger.\\n - Thank you, Ezra Bridger.\\n Well, you must have many responsibilities, yes? Yeah, too many at the moment.\\n Well, then join my crew, and I will split it right down the middle, fifty-forty.\\n You won\\'t get a better deal than that, especially from me.\\n Wait, that\\'s only 90%.\\n What about the other 10? Oh, you want me to spend that on expenses, trust me.\\n Okay, well, how about 0% for me? I want the generators.\\n All of them.\\n You have a deal, partner! Ah! This makes me happy! You get the generators, and I get you for my crew.\\n It is good.\\n Let us celebrate! Droid, droid! Go to the galley and bring me the most expensive drink you can and something for my friend.\\n - Uh, yeah, I think I\\'ll go with him.\\n - Of course, partner.\\n Don\\'t forget yours! I don\\'t know what just happened.\\n Di Did I just join his crew? No, no, I don\\'t want to leave the Ghost.\\n I I mean, not really.\\n Maybe I would make a pretty good pirate.\\n Inquisitors don\\'t hunt them, do they? What is that? - Vizago! - You? What are you doing here? II Wait, Hondo told me you lost your ship in a bet.\\n Oh! And you believed that swindler? By the moons of Gozgo, you are hopelessly gullible! Hey, I\\'m not the one who got locked in his own brig.\\n He shot me in the back with a stunner, eh, disabled my droids somehow.\\n Probably with this.\\n You must help me reclaim the Horn.\\n Sorry, but I\\'ve got other things to worry about.\\n You owe me, remember? I gave you information, and it saved your Jedi friend.\\n I am calling in that favor Now.\\n I know what I said earlier, Chop.\\n Okay, I\\'ll get you your ship, and then we\\'re even.\\n Fine with me.\\n Chopper, get the generators onboard the Phantom.\\n - My generators? - No, my generators.\\n Now, come along and behave.\\n I think you two know each other.\\n Partner, how could you let this dangerous criminal out of the brig? Save it, partner.\\n Let\\'s all relax.\\n I take the generators.\\n You two split Azmorigan\\'s credits.\\n - Everyone wins.\\n - That is a fair deal.\\n Hmm? - And it disgusts me.\\n - For once, I agree.\\n Care to hear my counter-offer? Excellent work! I will invest your share wisely.\\n Thanks a lot, partner! Keep the Jedi occupied.\\n Wha What could have possibly gone wrong now? I\\'m sorry, very sorry, but I do not work with droids.\\n Well, looks like you get your ship back, as promised.\\n Yes, but I lost all my credits and my generators! Eh, technically, they were my generators.\\n I hate children.\\n Not sure how we\\'re gonna explain all this.\\n What do you mean you know where Hondo will be? Well, wait.\\n I\\'m not done.\\n Then he let Vizago out! The villain was upon us, I\\'m telling you! But young Ezra, he stood tall in front of me and withstood a massive atta My friend! I was just talking about you.\\n How you and I rescued the generators from the evil Vizago.\\n Yeah, that\\'s not true.\\n You stole the generators and my ship.\\n What an accusation! You wound me! Chopper had the Phantom on autopilot.\\n Well, that\\'s another version of the story, I suppose.\\n I\\'ll tell you what.\\n You can keep my generators.\\n They are my gift to you.\\n Goodbye! Just so you know, at one time, I might have joined your crew.\\n You might Oh, Ezra.\\n You truly are a Jedi.\\n Contact Commander Sato.\\n Tell him Ezra Bridger found his generators.\\n So, you went for a little spin? - I was just trying to figure things out.\\n - And did you? I used to be like Hondo Out for myself and alone.\\n But that\\'s not who I am anymore.\\n You\\'re on a different path now.\\n And I have you guys.\\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels Transcripts]]'}, 'Gathering Forces': {'wikicontent': \"*(This episode begins with Ezra)\\n*'''Ezra''': Once we'll begin, there's no turning back. Got it? Follow my lead.\\n*'''Hera''': Chopper, I'm rolling us starboard. Be ready to fire those rear guns.\\n*'''Zeb''': Karabast! Chopper's down! Ow. Ow! I've got you covered, Hera. Roll away!\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Open fire. Their shields will not hold indefinitely.\\n*'''Hera (On Comlink)''': Sabine, I need you in the nose gun, now!\\n*'''Ezra''': Didn't you hear Hera?\\n*'''Sabine''': Didn't you hear Tseebo?\\n*'''Sabine''': He said he knows what happened to your parents.\\n*'''Ezra''': I already know what happened. They're dead. So go! Are they? Are my parents dead?\\n*'''Hera''': Someone want to explain to me why we're extra popular tonight?\\n*'''Kanan''': We've picked up a passenger the Rodian the imperials are hunting.\\n*'''Hera''': And he's important because?\\n*'''Sabine''': Because his cybernetic implant has downloaded half the Empire's secrets.\\n*'''Hera''': Okay, I can see why that's important. Let's get him out of here.\\n*'''Tseebo''': The Bridgers should hide. The troopers came. They took Mira and Ephraim Bridger away.\\n*'''Ezra''': Where? Where did they take them?\\n*'''Tseebo''': Forgive Tseebo. Forgive him.\\n*'''Ezra''': Forgive you?\\n*'''Tseebo''': Tseebo failed. Tseebo was afraid. Tseebo could not raise Ezra Bridger.\\n*'''Erza''': Coward! You could have stopped them! Why didn't you stop them?!\\n*'''Tseebo''': [implant beeping] [whimpers]\\n*'''Ezra''': Tseebo!\\n*'''Hera''': Shields down! Ezra, I need you in the cockpit!\\n*'''Ezra''': Yeah. On my way. Forgive you? My parents trusted you, and you failed them and you failed me. I'll never forgive you for that.\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Quite a ship.\\n*'''Hera''': Ezra. Nav-computer's off-line. With chopper down, I need you to fix it.\\n*'''Ezra''': Not exactly my specialty.\\n*'''Hera''': Well, make it your specialty and make it fast. Or this ship becomes a real ghost. Could really use that nav-computer!\\n*'''Ezra''': Rewiring fast as I--\\n*'''Tseebo''': For fast travel over interstellar distances, hyperspace is optimal.\\n*'''Hera''': What is he doing? I don't believe it. Hang on!\\n*'''Ezra''': Uh, Hera. This is Tseebo.\\n*'''Hera''': And did Tseebo just signal hyperspace coordinates directly to my ship?\\n*'''Ezra''': That would be my guess.\\n*'''Hera''': Well, then thank you, Tseebo. [sighs] I think you saved our lives.\\n*'''Ezra''': Yeah, I guess there's a first time for everything.\\n*'''Kassius Konstantine''': We are receiving a signal from the tracker. They will not be able to outrun us for long.\\n*'''Inquisitor''': I still sense the Jedi and his padawan within my grasp.\\n*'''Ezra''': So? Now what do we do with him?\\n*'''Kanan''': We have a few ideas. But you're the one who has history with Tseebo. What do you think we should do?\\n*'''Ezra''': Don't know. Don't much care.\\n*'''Kanan''': Ezra, you'll never advance as a Jedi if you can't be honest with yourself, at least.\\n*'''Ezra''': What's that supposed to mean?\\n*'''Kanan''': It means Tseebo matters to you. You do care what happens to him.\\n*'''Ezra''': Why should I? He did nothing to save my parents!\\n*'''Kanan''': What could he have done against the entire Empire?\\n*'''Sabine''': And besides, look at what he's done since. The imperials encourage these implants, but they're not mandatory. Not yet. He must have volunteered. And then he uploaded their secrets and ran. Maybe he's trying to make up for letting you down. Why else would he take on the Empire alone?\\n*'''Tseebo''': Empire. [speaking Huttese]\\n*'''Sabine''': He said the Empire can track the Ghost.\\n*'''Zeb''': Oh, please. The imperials can't follow us through hyperspace. \\n*'''Tseebo''': Imperial XX-23 S-thread tracker was developed by Sienar systems to trace ships through hyperspace to destination.\\n*'''Kanan''': Hera, could they have tagged us with that thing?\\n*'''Hera''': Guess we better find out.\\n*'''Chopper''': [chirping] [droid language, panicked]\\n*'''Hera''': Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, chop. You were just off-line for a few minutes. [sighs] We need you to scan the Ghost for that.\\n*'''Chopper''': [droid language]\\n*'''Zeb''': Stop grumbling and find that tracker, you rust bucket!\\n*'''Sabine''': So they did tag us.\\n*'''Hera''': Yes. But the good news is the tracer's actually on the hull of the Phantom.\\n*'''Zeb''': How is that good news exactly?\\n*'''Kanan''': It'll allow us to detach the Phantom and lure the imperials away from the Ghost and Tseebo.\\n*'''Sabine''': Whoa, whoa, whoa! You want to detach while in hyperspace? Do you know how incredibly dangerous that is?\\n*'''Kanan''': Not as dangerous as what I plan to do with the ship.\\n*'''Zeb''': Can't wait to hear this.\\n*'''Kanan''': I checked our current trajectory. If you can modify the hyperspace coordinates\\n*'''Hera''': I could.\\n*'''Kanan''': Then we can pass by the asteroid field where the old clone base is.\\n*'''Sabine''': You mean the base with the nasties who live in the shadows?\\n*'''Ezra''': Wait, what? Why would we want to go down there?\\n*'''Hera''': He's right, Kanan. Why not just drop the Phantom into our trail and let the imperials chase after their tracker?\\n*'''Kanan''': Because there's more than a tracker at work here. Back on Lothal, I sensed it. The Inquisitor is on our trail, and as long as Ezra and I are on board the Ghost, we're jeopardizing Tseebo's escape.\\n*'''Ezra''': So I gotta leave the Ghost and go to this nasty-filled asteroid as a favor to Tseebo?\\n*'''Kanan''': As a favor to all of us. And don't worry. I'll be right beside you.\\n*'''Sabine''': [sighs] So your parents do you really believe they're dead?\\n*'''Ezra''': Yes. No I-I don't know. Does it matter?\\n*'''Sabine''': Yeah, of course it matters. You have to talk to Tseebo before we go.\\n*'''Ezra''': Tried that already.\\n*'''Sabine''': Okay, so try harder! Once Hera takes him away, you may never see Tseebo again.\\n*'''Ezra''': Maybe that's for the best.\\n*'''Sabine''': Wha? How can you say that?\\n*'''Ezra''': Sabine [sighs] I've been on my own since I was seven, okay? If I'd let myself believe my folks were alive, if I let myself believe they'd come back and save me, I'd never have learned how to survive.\\n*'''Kanan''': You ready? Okay. Strap in. Prepping for separation. Once we're out of hyperspace, we'll head towards the asteroid base and lead the Empire there.\\n*'''Hera''': You sure about this? You won't be any more welcome there than the imperials.\\n*'''Kanan''': That's what I'm counting on.\\n*'''Hera''': Just be safe. And Ezra? Look out for Kanan.\\n*'''Ezra''': Somebody has to.\\n*'''Hera''': Ready for separation.\\n*'''Kanan''': Copy that, Ghost.\\n*'''Hera''': Five, four three, two one. Detach!\\n*'''Kanan''': Okay. Okay. [chuckles] That was the easy part.\\n*'''Inquisitor''': I sense movement in the Force.\\n*'''Kassius Konstantine''': Y-Yes. The tracker indicates the rebel ship has emerged from hyperspace. Should we --\\n*'''Inquisitor''': At once.\\n*'''Ezra''': Should we go over the plan again?\\n*'''Kanan''': I never told you what the plan was.\\n*'''Ezra''': Exactly.\\n*'''Kanan''': You remember the nasty creatures Hera and Sabine found here?\\n*'''Ezra''': Yeah. Oh, I'd rather forget them, but yes.\\n*'''Kanan''': Well, I'm gonna need you to connect with them like I was trying to teach you before if we're gonna survive this.\\n*'''Ezra''': Is now really the best time for a lesson?\\n*'''Kanan''': No, but I figure it's learning like you do best by surviving.\\n*'''Ezra''': Kanan, I can't. I'm afraid.\\n*'''Kanan''': [chuckles] I got news for you, kid. Everyone's afraid, but admitting it as you just did makes you braver than most, and it's a step forward.\\n*'''Ezra''': Yeah, into the jaws of a nightmare. Okay [quivery] Okay.\\n*'''Kanan''': I'll get the tracking device off the Phantom. You go make some new friends. Here we go.\\n*'''Ezra''': One with the force. One with the force. One with the force. I'm one with the force. One with the force. One with the force.\\n*'''Kanan''': You're blocked! Let go.\\n*'''Ezra''': I can't!\\n*'''Kanan''': Don't be afraid.\\n*'''Ezra''': I'm not afraid of them.\\n*'''Kanan''': Then what?\\n*'''Ezra''': I don't know.\\n*'''Kanan''': Yes, you do! Ezra! What are you afraid of?\\n*'''Ezra''': I'm afraid of I'm afraid of knowing. I'm afraid of the truth! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I forgive you, Tseebo!\\n*'''Tseebo''': I, too, am sorry. Forgive me for everything.\\n*'''Fulcrum''': Fulcrum to Ghost. Docking complete. Heading to the airlock now.\\n*'''Hera''': Acknowledged, Fulcrum. We're ready and waiting.\\n*'''Sabine''': I don't suppose Zeb and I could get to meet Fulcrum this time?\\n*'''Hera''': Nope. This time you stay in the cockpit.\\n*'''Zeb''': That's what we did last time. You seem better.\\n*'''Tseebo''': Tseebo's mind is clearer now. But it is difficult. There's so much information inside Tseebo.\\n*'''Hera''': Fulcrum's people will help you with that and keep you safe.\\n*'''Tseebo''': But will Tseebo see Ezra Bridger again?\\n*'''Hera''': I hope so. Someday. Is there anything you'd like me to tell him?\\n*'''Tseebo''': Tseebo failed Bridgers. Did not watch over their son. But Tseebo tried to make it right by accessing imperial files.\\n*'''Hera''': And that intel will be invaluable. \\n*'''Tseebo''': Oh, intel unimportant an accident. Tseebo access file on Ezra Bridger's parents. Tseebo knows Bridgers' fate.\\n*'''Hera''': Then tell me, Tseebo. Tell me, and I'll tell Ezra.\\n*'''Sandtrooper''': They're here, all right. The rebel ship is inside.\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Keep them contained. I want them alive.\\n*'''Sandtrooper''': Lights up! Steady. Sir, they're over here.\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Wait. I sense---\\n*'''Sandtrooper''': Sir! They're not alone. Shoot it! Shoot it! \\n*'''Inquisitor''': This was your plan? [chuckling] To lure us here and allow these creatures to do your work for you? \\n*'''Kanan''': How do you think it's going?\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Pathetically.\\n*'''Kanan''': Guess if you want something done right. \\n*''''Stormtrooper''': [screams] \\n*'''Kanan''': [grunts] \\n*'''Ezra''': Kanan!\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Your meager training is nothing in the face of true power.\\n*'''Ezra''': You're not going near him! \\n*'''Inquisitor''': I believe I am. In fact, it's time to end both Jedi and padawan for good. Your devotion to your master is admirable, but it will not save you. Nothing can.\\n*'''Ezra''': Get back!\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Ah, yes, good. Go on. Unleash your anger. [laughing] I will teach you what your master could not.\\n*'''Ezra''': You don't have anything to teach me.\\n*'''Inquisitor''': The darkness is too strong for you, orphan. It is swallowing you up, even now.\\n*'''Ezra''': No!\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Your master will die.\\n*'''Ezra''': No!\\n*'''Inquisitor''': Your friends will die. And everything you've hoped for will be lost. This is the way the story ends.\\n*'''Ezra''': No!\\n*'''Inquisitor''': [laughing]\\n*'''Kanan''': Ezra? No! Ezra.\\n*'''Ezra''': Kanan? What happened? I I feel so cold.\\n*'''Kanan''': I know. It's okay. We're leaving.\\n*'''Inquisitor''': [shouts] My master will not be pleased.\\n*'''Ezra''': I saved us?\\n*'''Kanan''': You did.\\n*'''Ezra''': But something doesn't feel right.\\n*'''Kanan''': If your will isn't strong enough when you open yourself to the force, you become vulnerable to the dark side. \\n*'''Ezra''': I was trying to protect you.\\n*'''Kanan''': I know. But your anger and fear caused that giant creature to attack.\\n*'''Ezra''': I don't remember it. \\n*'''Kanan''': [exhales] That's for the best. Your powers are growing so quickly, you weren't prepared. I didn't teach you what you needed to know. I'm sorry.\\n*'''Sabine''': Welcome back, you two.\\n*'''Zeb''': You outsmarted them again. Good job, boss.\\n*'''Hera''': You made it.\\n*'''Kanan''': Was there any doubt?\\n*'''Hera''': Never. Ezra, I have something---\\n*'''Kanan''': Ezra needs a little time to himself right now. [sighs] We need to talk.\\n*'''Sabine''': [sighs] Rough couple of days.\\n*'''Ezra''': Yeah. It's been strange.\\n*'''Sabine''': I have just what you need. It's the holo-disk from your old house. It was pretty degraded, but I cleaned it up. And I found something.\\n*'''Ezra''': Mom? Dad.\\n*'''Sabine''': [chuckles] Happy birthday, Ezra Bridger.\\n*'''[End of Gathering Forces]'''\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels Transcripts]]\"}, 'Twilight of the Apprentice: Part I': {'wikicontent': 'Once we drop out of hyperspace, we\\'ll be going dark.\\n- Are you sure about this? - Yes.\\nAhsoka, you don\\'t have to go to Malachor alone.\\n- I could be there in two rotations.\\n- I\\'m not alone, Rex.\\nYou know, I could have ordered you to take me along.\\nYou don\\'t exactly outrank me anymore.\\nIn my book, experience outranks everything.\\nHmm, then I definitely outrank you.\\nMay the Force be with you.\\nWhy is Rex so worried?

Where do you think you\\'re going? Following that droid? Well, he certainly seems to be on a mission, so you had better accelerate yourself.\\nSpectre-4, time to go! Right.\\nSpectre-1 to Ghost.\\nWe\\'re good to go.\\nGoing.\\nOh, look.\\nChopper made friends.\\nI am C-3PO, and this is my counterpart, R2-D2.\\nI was translating for Minister Tua when we were attacked by thieves like, uh you.\\nWe have company.\\nImperial droids.\\nSpectre-5, let\\'s get a couple restraining bolts on these two.\\nYup.\\nOn it.\\nSpectre-6, Spectre-3, keep an eye on \\'em.\\nRight.\\nThat\\'ll happen.\\nExcuse me, sir, but this is a terrible mistake.\\nMy partner and I are in service - of Minister Tua of Lothal - Kanan.\\nA word?

Maybe we get those disruptors out of circulation instead.\\nLeast we got \\'em out of imperial circulation.\\nWhen I was translating, I found out they were shipping those T-7s as prototypes so the Empire could mass-produce them on Lothal.\\nSee, Zeb? Perfect crime.\\nWe steal weapons meant for the Empire and sell them for credits we desperately need to keep this bird flying.\\nOh, hey.\\nIf we need credits, maybe Vizago will buy those two droids.\\nYeah.\\nGood idea.\\nDescribe the thieves.\\nI saw five an adult male, a juvenile male, a juvenile female, an old C1 droid and a Lasat.\\nHonestly, Agent Kallus, I didn\\'t think there were any Lasats left.\\nA few, minister.\\nOnly a few.\\nAnd stay out! You can\\'t do that! It\\'s my cabin too.\\nEzra? Come in here.\\nHera, Zeb\\'s booted me from my own I know, but maybe you could cut Zeb a little slack today.\\nOh, the way he cuts me slack? Do you know what a T-7 disruptor is, - what it does to an organic being? - Uh no.\\nWell, Zeb knows.\\nBecause it\\'s what the Imperials used on his people when they cleared his home world.\\nVery few Lasats survived.\\nAnd none remain on Lasan.\\nI I guess I could cut him a little slack.\\nGood man.\\nSo, how\\'s the Jedi training going with Kanan? Jedi training? Never heard of it.\\nWe\\'ll see about that.\\nHome, sweet home.\\n- Can we discuss this later? - That\\'s fine, love.\\nBut we will discuss it.\\nOh, right.\\nThis R2 says its real mission was to make sure the T-7s never reached the Empire, and that his master will pay handsomely for their return.\\nI\\'ll think about it.\\nSo, we\\'re not selling the droids, but we\\'re selling the T-7s? We don\\'t even know who Vizago\\'s buyer is.\\nWe know it\\'s not the Empire, and I already made a deal with Vizago.\\nSo let\\'s get these crates off the boat.\\nSir, a distress call to Governor Pryce has been rerouted to your attention.\\nThis is C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.\\nMy counterpart and I were abducted from the spaceport on Garel by criminals.\\nThieves! Outlaws! Remain calm, my friend.\\nAll I need is your location.\\nSending our coordinates now.\\nHave no fear.\\nHelp is on the way.\\nOh.\\nI can make some beautiful music with these.\\nThey\\'re not that kind of instruments! Ah.\\nYou just have to know how to play them.\\nAnd how to play those who want to buy them.\\n- You have to buy them from us first.\\n- Finally.\\nSomeone on your crew who understands business.\\nLet\\'s just get this over with.\\nWhat is this? - You were followed! - That\\'s not possible.\\nTell it to the Empire! Leave the rest.\\nWe\\'re gone! You haven\\'t paid us.\\nCikatro Vizago doesn\\'t pay for half a shipment.\\nAnd he doesn\\'t pay for trouble with Imperials.\\nMy friends, I hope you live to bargain another day.\\nAnd if you don\\'t eh.\\nShouldn\\'t we be going too? We can\\'t let these disruptors fall into imperial hands.\\n- Sabine, destroy the guns.\\n- Ha.\\nNow you\\'re speaking my language.\\nI\\'ll go get my gear.\\nR2-D2, stop! What are you doing? Joining the crew? Of course.\\nOverload the disruptors, and boom! Good call, little guy.\\nYou can join our crew anytime.\\nWell, short my circuits.\\nHera, help Sabine open the crates.\\nZeb, Ezra, line \\'em up.\\nMeanwhile, I\\'ll deal with the walkers.\\nAdvance and fire.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nI knew some form of rescue would arrive.\\nI told R2, but he thinks so ill of stormtroopers.\\nWait! Don\\'t shoot! Don\\'t shoot! You\\'re here to rescue me! Chopper, ready the ship for takeoff! You! Lasat! Face me! - Wait! - Zeb! Only the honor guard of Lasan may carry a bo-rifle! I know.\\nI removed it from a guardsman myself.\\nI was there when Lasan fell.\\nI know why you fear those disruptors.\\nI gave the order to use them.\\nThat fool Lasat\\'s gonna get himself killed.\\nOkay.\\nWe\\'re ready.\\nEveryone, push! No! - Spectre-2, get the kid aboard.\\n- Right.\\nMove, all of you, now! Zeb! Come on, big guy.\\nWe gotta get out of here.\\nZeb? Will our torment never end? Chopper, get us out of here.\\nWill he be okay? Yeah.\\nThanks, mate.\\nAppreciate the save.\\nWasn\\'t me.\\nIt was Ezra.\\nAnd, Ezra, your formal Jedi training starts tomorrow.\\nThat\\'s very generous, sir.\\nWell, I\\'m very fond of these droids.\\nThen I\\'m glad we could return them.\\nThe simplest gesture of kindness can fill a galaxy with hope.\\n- Isn\\'t that a Jedi saying? - Safe travels, my friend.\\nSafe travels.\\nYou didn\\'t tell them my name.\\nOf course I didn\\'t, Senator Organa.\\nBut this entire ordeal has rather stressed every one of my circuits.\\n- Permission to shut down? - Granted.\\nYou recorded everything, old friend?

And if he gets caught -\\n\\n'''Hera''': He hasn't gotten caught so far.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': The minute he gets that decoder, Zeb yanks him out of there.\\n\\n'''Hera''': Uh, that's the plan.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': I should've done this myself.\\n\\n'''Hera''': Oh, yeah. You'd make quite a Cadet. \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Excuse me, sir. I have your new datapad. I can leave it on your desk. \\n\\n'''Agent''' '''Kallus''': No. I'll take it now.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': One decoder, as ordered.\\n\\n'''Zare''': What do you think you're doing? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Hey, get outta there! \\n\\n'''Zare''': Figured it would be something like this. \\n\\n'''Ezra''': It's not what you think.\\n\\n'''Zare''': I think this device has a built-in sensor, which would trigger that. You try walking out with this thing, the whole facility goes on lockdown.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': Wait. Are you trying to help me? \\n\\n'''Zare''': You really want to discuss this here and now? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Mmm, not so much.\\n\\n'''Sabine''': Specter-5 to Ghost. Something went wrong. The kid didn't get the device, and he didn't come out.\\n\\n'''Hera''': Copy that, Specter-5. Give him one more day. \\n\\n'''Kanan''': This decoder better be worth this risk. \\n\\n'''Hera''': What's the alternative? Do you want to stop that Kyber shipment or not? You know what the Empire could do with that crystal.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': Nothing good.\\n\\n'''Hera''': So we give Ezra one more day.\\n\\n'''Zare''': What do you need that decoder for? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': My friends need it to stop an Imperial shipment. How'd you know about the sensors? \\n\\n'''Zare''': \\xc2\\xa0From my sister, Dhara. She was the star Cadet in this place. She knew the entire Imperial complex backwards and forwards.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': What happened to her? \\n\\n'''Zare''': Well, they told us she ran off. But I don't believe it. What were you doing breaking into Kallus's office? That's a great way to get shot.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': Long story, but I need that decoder. And I could use a partner who knows - his way around.\\n\\n'''Zare''': What's in it for me? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Do you really need a reason to mess with the Empire? \\n\\n'''Zare''': No, I don't.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': Good. We have to finish in the top three tomorrow if we're gonna get back inside Imperial H.Q.\\n\\n'''Zare''': Then let's do it. I'm Zare, by the way. Zare Leonis. And you're Dev, right? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Yeah. Yeah, that's me.\\n\\n'''Aresko''': Today's assessment will be a little more challenging. You will need to shoot the targets to activate the panels necessary to climb out. \\n\\n'''Grint''': Three, two, one! \\n\\n'''Aresko''': Oleg seems to have taken your correction to heart, Mr. Grint.\\n\\n'''Zare''': I'm not gonna make it! \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Sorry, Jai.\\n\\n'''Aresko''': Cadets, follow Morgan's example. There is no friendship in war. The only thing that matters is victory. Victory at any cost. Tomorrow's final trial will push all of you to your limits. The reward for success will be a training session aboard an Imperial walker.\\n\\n'''Jai''': Dev, you sabotaged me! \\n\\n'''Ezra''': I did what I had to do.\\n\\n'''Jai''': Good to know.\\n\\n'''Zare''': How are you gonna reach anything from up there? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Don't worry. I've been training to be a Jedi.\\n\\n'''Zare''': Yeah, right. Who isn't? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': You'll see.\\n\\n'''Kallus''': Come.\\n\\n'''Zare''': Sir, your podracer parts have been delivered. If you'll just sign off here, I'll bring them up.\\n\\n'''Kallus''': Obviously, there's been a mistake. What would I want with podracer parts? \\n\\n'''Zare''': No mistake, sir. It says right here two crates of secondhand podracer parts for Agent Kallus. I enjoy a good podrace myself, sir.\\n\\n'''Zare''': So were you gonna sign it? \\n\\n'''Kallus''': Cadet, are you ignorant? I said this is a mistake.\\n\\n'''Zare''': Sir, yes, sir! Sorry, sir.\\n\\n'''Aresko''': As usual, the assessments have proven quite illuminating. I believe we've identified two Cadets, Morgan and Kell, that meet your special criteria, Inquisitor.\\n\\n'''Grand''' '''Inquisitor''': Excellent, Commandant. Tomorrow, I will arrive on Lothal to test them myself. If the tests are conclusive, I will take them into custody.\\n\\n'''Zeb''': Did you get the decoder? Good. Where's Ezra? \\n\\n'''Chopper''': [Droid language]\\n\\n'''Sabine''': What? What do you mean he went back to the Academy? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Guys, I know you're expecting me, but I have to stay at the Academy. There's this kid there, Jai Kell. And he'll get scooped up by the Inquisitor if I don't help him. \\n\\n'''Zeb''': Wait. The Inquisitor? Is Ezra out of his - \\n\\n'''Ezra''': You probably think I've lost my mind. And you're probably right. But it's your fault. The old me never stuck his neck out for a stranger. Clearly, I've spent way too long with you heroes. Decode the hyperspace coordinates and get them to Specter-1. Oh, and if you're not too busy, attack the Academy tomorrow at noon. I could use the diversion so I can get out of here. Specter-6 out.\\n\\n'''Sabine''': Specter-5 to Ghost. Sending coordinates for Imperial jump route. If you leave now, you should still be able to intercept.\\n\\n'''Hera''': Coordinates received. We're heading out.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': Good work, Specter-5, and you too, Specter-6.\\n\\n'''Sabine''': Uh, Specter-6 isn't with us.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': What? Where is he? Specter-5, repeat! Where's Specter-6? \\n\\n'''Hera''': Kanan, we're out of range. All we can do now is complete the mission and get back as soon as possible.\\n\\n'''Jai''': Huh? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Shh. Come with me. Jai. Trust me. Please. And that's why you need to come with us and leave tomorrow.\\n\\n'''Jai''': No. No way. This is just another dirty trick. You're trying to get me busted out of the Academy.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': Uh, yeah. But not the way you think. The Inquisitor - \\n\\n'''Jai''': Please. I don't believe this Inquisitor exists. And even if he does, then maybe it's a good thing. The Inquisitor trains me. I get a top rank in the Empire.\\n\\n'''Zare''': Kell, you got a family? \\n\\n'''Jai''': Uh, it's just me and my mother.\\n\\n'''Zare''': And how would she feel if she never saw you again? My sister disappeared from this place. And I'm betting it was the Inquisitor who took her away. So unless you're ready to say bye to Mom forever -\\n\\n'''Jai''': Okay. What's the plan? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Simple. The three of us have to win tomorrow's challenge.\\n\\n'''Zare''': Not so simple.\\n\\n'''Jai''': How's that gonna get us out of here? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Because it gets us inside that walker.\\n\\n'''Hera''': Kanan, there are three ships. And we'll only get one shot at this.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': The Kyber crystal resonates with the Force. It's in the middle ship.\\n\\n'''Hera''': You sure? \\n\\n'''Kanan''': I'm sure.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': Come on. Keep up! \\n\\n'''Zare''': Jai, look out! \\xc2\\xa0Dev! \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Keep going.\\n\\n'''Aresko''': Well, well. Cadets Kell, Leonis and Oleg win the day and the prize.\\n\\n'''Jai''': You were supposed to be on the walker with us. Now what? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Stick to the plan. I'll find a way to get on board.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': Come on, boys. Take the bait. Hera, you're good to go.\\n\\n'''Hera''': Copy that.\\n\\n'''Zare''': So these control movement and this fires the cannons. But what are these? \\n\\n'''Stormtrooper''': Gyroscopics. Here, I'll show you.\\n\\n[Explosion]\\n\\n'''Grint''': We're under attack! \\n\\n'''Stormtrooper''': What was that? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': My signal.\\n\\n'''Oleg''': What are you doing? \\n\\n'''Jai''': Guess there's no turning back now.\\n\\n'''Zare''': No.\\n\\n'''Bridge''' '''Officer''': Calculate the jump to hyperspace. Have every remaining ship buy us the time we need.\\n\\n'''Aresko''': We are under attack. Repeat, under attack. Lower the blast doors! \\n\\n'''Jai''': Look! Do something! \\n\\n'''Grint''': Commandant! Whoever's controlling that walker is part of the attack! \\n\\n'''Aresko''': This is LRC-01. A rogue walker is loose in the Academy. Advance and destroy.\\n\\n'''Jai''': Fire back! \\n\\n'''Zare''': I'm trying! \\n\\n'''Kanan''': Hera, that transport's gonna be gone any second and the cargo along with it. Take your shot! \\n\\n'''Bridge''' '''Crewmember''': Calculations complete.\\n\\n'''Bridge''' '''Officer''': Commence hyperspace jump.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': Hera! \\n\\n'''Hera''': I see it! Come on! \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Let me in! \\n\\n'''Aresko''': Look! Morgan's attempting to fight off the insurgents single-handed! \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Whoa! Whoa! \\n\\n'''Zare''': Hold on! \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Thanks.\\n\\n'''Sabine''': Don't mention it.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': Help me! We gotta get 'em out. You guys okay? \\n\\n'''Jai''': Yeah. Let's just get out of here.\\n\\n'''Zare''': Wait. Give me that blaster.\\n\\n'''Jai''': Uh, sure. Why? \\n\\n'''Zare''': Because I'm staying.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': What? \\n\\n'''Zare''': It's the only way I'll ever find my sister.\\n\\n'''Sabine''': We got bucketheads inbound! I'll keep in touch.\\n\\n'''Zeb''': Get in! \\n\\n'''Inquisitor''': This is a black mark, Commandant. I do not know this boy, but this one I know. This is the Padawan I encountered on Stygeon Prime.\\n\\n'''Aresko''': That is Morgan. The other was Kell. Cadet Zare Leonis here came very close to stopping the escape. He was part of the traitor's squad and knew them well - or thought so.\\n\\n'''Inquisitor''': \\xc2\\xa0How admirable. Well, Leonis, let's take a walk, shall we? I want to know everything about your former friends.\\n\\n'''Hera''': Jai, we'll take you to your mother, but you'll both have to go into hiding.\\n\\n'''Jai''': Yeah, from the Empire. No problem.\\n\\n'''Hera''': \\xc2\\xa0We'll help with that too.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': So how was it, kid? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': Forgot what it was like to be on my own.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': You miss it? \\n\\n'''Ezra''': No grumpy robots, no smelly Lasats. It's good to be back.\\n\\n'''Kanan''': At ease, Cadet.\\n\\n'''Ezra''': Sir, yes, sir.\\n\\n[End Episode: Breaking Ranks]\\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels Transcripts]]\"}, 'Call to Action': {'wikicontent': '*\\'\\'\\'Maketh Tua\\'\\'\\': Ah, Grand Moff Tarkin. I am honored by your visit to Lothal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': My visit is hardly an honor, Minister.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Maketh Tua\\'\\'\\': I-I was surprised to learn you were coming.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': And I, too, have been surprised by what\\'s been happening on your little backwater world.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Maketh Tua\\'\\'\\': [Chuckles] If you are referring to the insurgents, I---\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': In the absence of Governor Pryce, you have had a single, simple objective, Minister to protect the Empire\\'s industrial interests here. Interests which are vital to our expansion throughout the Outer Rim. But instead of protecting those interests, you have allowed a cell of insurgents to flourish right under your nose. Am I correct?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Maketh Tua\\'\\'\\': [Clears throat]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': And, Agent Kallus, have you just stood idly by while this rabble have attacked our men, destroyed our property and disrupted our trade?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': I have exhausted every resource to capture them, sir. This group has proven quite elusive.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Maketh Tua\\'\\'\\': It\\'s said their leader is a Jedi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Ah, yes. Let us not forget the sudden appearance of a Jedi, as if leaping from the pages of ancient history. A shame we don\\'t have someone who specializes in dealing with them, otherwise our problem might be solved. Minister, have you ever met a Jedi?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Maketh Tua\\'\\'\\': No. I--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': I actually knew the Jedi not from the pages of folklore or children\\'s tales, but as flesh and blood. And do you know what happened to them?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Maketh Tua\\'\\'\\': Well, there were rumors--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': They died. Every last one of them. So you see, this criminal cannot be what he claims to be, and I shall prove it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Aren\\'t we headed the wrong way?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Don\\'t want to lead \\'em back to the ship. Follow me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Cumberlayne Aresko\\'\\'\\': They\\'re making for town. Order our units to split up. We\\'ll box them in.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Gotcha.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Pilot Trooper\\'\\'\\': Stay on \\'em. I\\'ll cut \\'em off.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Clearing throats] Told you that would work.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': You\\'re finally getting the hang of this. There\\'s hope for you yet.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Alton\\'\\'\\': Senator Trayvis, now that you\\'ve recommitted yourself to the Empire, - will your followers do the same?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Gall Trayvis\\'\\'\\': Most will, Alton. These were good people who simply wanted to make the Empire a better place peacefully. But I\\'m afraid these insurgents have twisted my message into something violent and frightening. Of course, I can\\'t abide that. So I\\'m personally offering a reward for their capture--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Scoffs] Karabast. Shut it off.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Still makes me sick to think that Trayvis is working for the Empire.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Every time we win, we lose.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Well, I have a plan that might just even the score. If Trayvis can do it, we can do it too.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': What, we\\'re gonna send out some kind of inspirational type messages?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Exactly.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Exactly.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Um, I don\\'t get it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yeah, Kanan. What are you thinking? We can\\'t just send a signal. The Empire would track it in half a second.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not if the signal comes from one of its own towers.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': [Snaps fingers] Ah. Now I get it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You-You want to take control of an Imperial communications tower, which is pretty much impossible, and then you want to use it to send a message to the people of Lothal?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not just Lothal. One of those big towers can reach a few systems.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': That\\'s a crazy plan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': That\\'s why you like it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': And what would we say in this message?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Something the Empire never says the truth.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Chitters]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': We have to let people know what it\\'s really like out here. Now, are you in?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Count me in\\n*\\'\\'\\'Cumberlayne Aresko\\'\\'\\': Commandant Cumberlayne Aresko and Taskmaster Myles Grint reporting.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Gentlemen. Sit. I understand you have experience dealing with these insurgents.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Cumberlayne Aresko\\'\\'\\': Oh, yes, sir.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': And your efforts have been less than successful?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Cumberlayne Aresko\\'\\'\\': [Stammers] W-Well, I, uh I wouldn\\'t say--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Commandant, if your efforts had been successful, we would not be having this little chat. Now, when was the last activity reported?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Myles Grint\\'\\'\\': Sir, we, uh, responded personally to an attack last night in one of the outlying towns.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': And the details of this attack?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Cumberlayne Aresko\\'\\'\\': Uh, nothing of note. The insurgents stole some supplies and escaped on speeder bikes. No casualties.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Ah, but you see, Commandant, there is something of note in that report \"no casualties.\" Your rebel cell is more principled than others.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Myles Grint\\'\\'\\': Others, sir? You mean there are other cells?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Cells, factions, tribes Call them what you will. They lack the one thing that would make them a credible threat to the Empire unity. While your cell seems uninterested in violence, it does present a specific threat the Jedi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Cumberlayne Aresko\\'\\'\\': We have encountered him, sir, and he lives up to their reputation.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Oh, I doubt that very much. But I am not concerned with his skills as a warrior.\\nI am concerned with what he represents. Or perhaps I should say, I am concerned by what you allow him to represent by failing to stop him hope. There are whispers of this alleged Jedi in the streets. In time, such whispers might spark belief in something other than the strength and security of the Empire. And that, gentlemen, is something I cannot have. Make no mistake.\\nFrom now on, failure will have consequences. Agent Kallus, you will dispatch probe droids to every known location of insurgent activity on Lothal. We will discover the whereabouts of these criminals and we will make examples of them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': There it is. The Empire\\'s main communications tower on Lothal. It routes comm from every Imperial operation on the planet, including the Empire\\'s Holonet broadcasts.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I got bucketheads on the perimeter and at least three anti-ship batteries around the base. Not an easy trip to the front door.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Don\\'t underestimate yourself.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Sabine, let\\'s be optimistic. Say we get to the front door.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': What then? I-I could upload a data spike into the central computer and have that transmitter operational in I don\\'t know, five minutes?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I said be optimistic.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Five minutes is optimistic.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Three is better.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Hey. You can have it good or you can have it fast.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': All right. Scan us a holomap and let\\'s get out of here. I don\\'t like the look of that thing.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Imperial probe droid.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Does it see us?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Not yet.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': How can you tell?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Because we\\'re not dead.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Imperial Probe Droid\\'\\'\\': [Speaking droid language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': We need to move.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Um, hate to mention this, but where are the bikes?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Next to the road.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Right where that thing will see them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Imperial Probe Droid\\'\\'\\': [Droid language continues]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Hope somebody\\'s got an idea, or this whole plan is shot. I could have blasted it and gotten that result.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yeah, but then the Empire would suspect something was up.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Good thinking, Padawan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Okay. It\\'s touching when you two bond, but I\\'m betting that probe has friends, so let\\'s move it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Imperial Probe Droid\\'\\'\\': [Droid language continues]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Governor, one of our probes seems to have found something. We believe these are the speeder bikes responsible for the rebel activity near Jalath.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Where was this footage taken?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Outside the main communications tower.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': A perfect target for these criminals.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': We can\\'t risk losing the tower. We should reinforce security--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': No. Let them believe they still possess the element of surprise. Lure them in, and we shall be waiting.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': As you wish.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Inquisitor, I am giving you the opportunity to redeem yourself. Do not disappoint me. And remember, I want this Jedi alive.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Your faith will be rewarded.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': If it works, we should be able to use this to transmit directly through the tower.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': How we doing?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Well, Chopper has the spike. We get him into the tower and he can upload it right into the computer core from any terminal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Stop complaining, bolt-brain. You have the easy job.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What\\'s the range of this spike?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': As long as the tower is transmitting, we\\'re good to go. Everyone will hear what we say. Well, anyone who\\'s listening.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Once the spike is uploaded, we\\'ll signal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': And I spirit you away in the Phantom.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': That\\'s the plan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': And things always go according to plan, right?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': She\\'s right about that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What\\'s with you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Nothing.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Let\\'s take a walk. What\\'s on your mind?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I\\'m not sure we should go through with this.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Ezra, you are up to this. I know you are.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I know that\\'s what you want to think. But look. As much as I wish I was like my parents, I\\'m not.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': There\\'s something else.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] My parents spoke out and I lost them, and I don\\'t-- [Grunts] I-I don\\'t want to lose you guys, okay? Not over this.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Hey. All of us have lost things. And we will take more losses before this is over. But we can\\'t let that stop us from taking risks. We have to move forward. And when the time comes, we have to be ready to sacrifice for something bigger.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': That sounds good, but it\\'s not so easy.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] It\\'s not easy for me either. My master tried to show me, but I don\\'t think I ever understood it until now trying to teach it to you. [Sighs] I guess you and I are learning these things together.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Droid Language)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Okay, Sabine, three minutes.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Chopper, install the spike.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What? They\\'re here? That\\'s impossible.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Time\\'s up.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Sabine, we got targets incoming, Let\\'s move!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': You said I\\'d get three minutes.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (On Comlink) Well, now you get one, so hurry up!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Droid Language)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Yeah, you and me both.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Go get Zeb.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I\\'m staying right here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No, you\\'re getting Zeb then coming back here. Now go! Spectre-1 to Phantom. We\\'re gonna change our pickup.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': (On Comlink) Not a good ideam Spectre-1.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Plan\\'s changing. Just get your eyes on the sky. We\\'ll meet you up there.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': (On Comlink) Copy that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Okay, I got a signal. It worked. Let\\'s go.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Zeb, come on. Kanan wants us to move.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': But I like this gun.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We\\'ll get you another gun!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Yeah, I can get another gun.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not this way. Back inside.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Are you crazy?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\'; take the lift. Hera will meet you at the top.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Wait. What about you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I\\'ll take the next one.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Let\\'s go.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Ezra. I\\'ll be right behind you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Now this is a familiar situation.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Same situation, same ending. You lose.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t think so.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Where\\'s Kanan?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': What did you hope to gain by coming here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You\\'re clever. Figure it out.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': You\\'ve been practicing.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Nice of you notice.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': There\\'s someone who wants to meet you. I your surrender now. He might your friends live. Unexpected.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': We\\'re full of surprises.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Kanan!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Spectre-2, get ou of here!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': (on Comlink) Not an option, Kanan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No time! Go!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We can\\'t!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Hera! Looks like I have time to meet your friend after all.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Well done, Inquisitor. These are the results I expect. So, you are the Jedi in question?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Whatever you want from me, you won\\'t get it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Sir, we have a problem.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Explain.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': It appears the insurgents have gained control of the tower\\'s transmitter.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We have been called criminals, but we are not. We are rebels, fighting for the people, fighting for you. I\\'m not that old, but I remember a time when things were better on Lothal. Maybe not great, but never like this. See what the Empire has done to your lives, your families and your freedom? It\\'s only gonna get worse... unless we stand up and fight back. It won\\'t be easy. There will be loss and sacrifice. But we can\\'t back down just because we\\'re afraid. That\\'s when we need to stand the tallest. That\\'s what my parents taught me. That\\'s why my new family helped me remember. Stand up together. Because that\\'s when we\\'re strongest-- as one.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tarkin\\'\\'\\': You do not know what it takes to win a war. But I do.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Was Call to Action it worth it?

But obviously that\\'s not true since the ship went missing, so you know, there must be something out here.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Sato\\'\\'\\': When Captain Syndulla said you volunteered for this mission, she insisted you could be helpful.

But still, it doesn\\'t make any sense. You can\\'t pull a ship out of hyperspace because you never know exactly where it is, a tractor beam can\\'t get a lock.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': That\\'s \\'cause this isn\\'t a tractor beam, it\\'s a gravity well. When I was at the Academy, they were developing a new cruiser with gravity well projectors powerful enough to pull a ship out of hyperspace.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Well, it looks like they finished it.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Chances are their still testing the system. If they follow Imperial procedure, the testing zone for this type of ship wouldn\\'t be that large. You\\'ll probably find it not that far from where we lost contact with Commander Sato.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Alright, everybody, gear up. We\\'re going out there.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Not everybody. You and Rex will go to that system. Find that ship and I bet you find Ezra and the others.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not Rex, I\\'ll take Zeb or Sabine.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Rex\\'s military experience will be invaluable and he can also impersonate a stormtrooper.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Right, because he \\'\\'is\\'\\' a stormtrooper.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': No, he was a clone trooper,\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kenan\\'\\'\\': Same thing,\\n* \\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Kanan, I sent Ezra.

Out here searching for your missing patrol, I assume. \\n* \\'\\'\\'Sato\\'\\'\\': We are members of the Corporate Alliance. You have taken possession of my ships illegally and I demand you release us.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Titus\\'\\'\\': You are in a position to demand nothing, Commander Sato. Ah, yes, I am familiar with your activities in this sector. I suspected if we captured even one Rebel ship, others would race to the rescue, but I dared not hope we would capture someone as significant as you. And what might your name be, young man?\\n* \\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Jabba the Hutt.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Titus\\'\\'\\': Indeed. You are a tad small for a Hutt, but I know someone else who goes by the name \"Jabba\", Ezra Bridger. I imagine Agent Kallus will be quite pleased to hear you have joined us. Secure them.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Look, for the record, this wasn\\'t my idea.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Just try to act like a professional.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What if you get in there and forget whose side you\\'re on?\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': I would never be on their side or wear their junk armour.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Here are your disguises.\\n* [Stormtrooper groans]\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] Perfect. This garbage is nothing like clone armour.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Looks a little tight on ya, old man.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Yeah?

How is it the Empire lets us keep stealing these things?\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Oh, I thought it was the same one we used before.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t know why she does that.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': I believe it\\'s called artistic expression.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Yeah? Well, my expression is wrong. I\\'m not happy about being on this mission.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Really? That wasn\\'t clear.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Laughs]\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Once we board this thing, Chopper will plug in, find out where they have our people, and we get them out of there.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': We\\'ve got to disable this weapon, whatever it is.  If the Empire is able to intercept our ships in hyperspace, this Rebel movement won\\'t last long.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I hear what you\\'re saying, but remember this is a rescue mission first and foremost. We\\'re coming up on Ezra\\'s last known position.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Let\\'s just hope we can find that ship fast.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Uh-oh.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Exclaims]\\n* \\'\\'\\'Imperial Crewmember (transmission)\\'\\'\\': Shuttle S2-57, this is a restricted area.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Copy that, sir.

Excellent work, Admiral. Lock him in a secure cell under triple guard.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Titus\\'\\'\\': Triple guard? He is but a child.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': I warn you, do not underestimate that boy.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Titus\\'\\'\\': I am certain the Imperial navy\\'\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'is more than a match for one boy, whatever he calls himself.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': We shall see. I\\'m on my way.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Well, all set?\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I guess. This must be just like old times.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Ha.

You guys fought great.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Thanks. All I saw was you. You shot us! I can\\'t believe you shot us.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I mean, you were dressed like stormtroopers.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Yeah.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': You shot us.

We\\'ve got to find Sato and sabotage this ship. They have this gravity weapon thing that-. You already know this.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': So, what\\'s your plan?\\n* \\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, we should probably split up. I\\'ll take Chopper and he can get me to the reactor that powers this thing. You to bust out Sato.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We are not splitting up. Let\\'s get Sato and get out of here.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': The kid\\'s right, we have to destroy this ship.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Do you know how many stormtroopers are heading this way?\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': Doesn\\'t matter.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': We can\\'t afford to separate.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Rex\\'\\'\\': We have to protect the fleet.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Will you two quit it already?

But she\\'s got company.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': What kind of company she\\'s got?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Oh, fantastic. its Agent Kallus.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Minister Tua\\'\\'\\': Thank you, Agent Kallus, but there, there was no need for an escort.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': Lord Vader has asked me to make sure you reached your shuttle safety. We can\\'t be too careful about security these days.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Minister Tua\\'\\'\\': Yes. I suppose so.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Hey!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': Prime Minister, take cover!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Surprise.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': Rebels!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Prime Minister, get to the shuttle! We\\'ll be right behind you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Minister Tua\\'\\'\\': Right.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Prime Minister Tua.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': You did this!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Zeb, we need a pickup. Now!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Copy. We\\'re on our way. Come on!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Come on. Come on! Up, everybody! We\\'re moving outta here!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) Everything has just happened as you already predicted, Lord Vader.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': Good, Now Simply inform the populace that the rebel assassins will hide in their midsts. Lock down the spaceports and make it known to any ships attempting to leave the planet will be destroyed.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) Right away my Lord.\\n*[IN THE GODDARD SHUTTLE]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Alton\\'\\'\\': A beloved citizen of Lothal, Prime Minister Tua\\'s life was tragically cut short by these criminal band of rebels. If you do see them,  Please summon Imperial authorities immediately. Trooper crops have been already mobilized in an extensive sea..\\'click\\'\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': They did this just to turn Lothal against all of us. We simply can\\'t do any more good here. We have to leave Lothal, for good.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We can\\'t just run hera. The people have to know the truth Sooner or later.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t think the Galactic Empire is giving us much choice at the moment.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': What the...\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\': Open up in there!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We\\'re in big trouble!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Growls)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': They resealed the doors.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Blast it open. Hold your fire. Hold your fire!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': If they know about the hideout we are at, they\\'ll probably know about our others.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': There\\'s no more hiding for us. We need a fast ship asap. Maybe we can try one of the local Imperial airfields.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': They\\'re already locked down. Besides, we\\'ll never get outside the capital.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': The Galactic Empire\\'s looking everywhere for us.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not everywhere.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': The Imperial Complex? Are you crazy Kanan?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Does anyone every say yes to that question?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': He\\'s right. Deploying troops to blocking every city exit has spread the garrisons thin. It sounds crazy, but the area with the least troops will be... ...here, near the factories. There are landing platforms outside these hangars. They\\'re our best chance if we\\'re ever gonna find a shuttle.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I\\'m already dressed for the part.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I guess there is no going home for us.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': What\\'s this?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Power cells in need of recharging for the rebel pursuit.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Hold it right there, Cadet. We have to check inside.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I got this. No, you don\\'t have to check inside.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Did you just try to give me an order, Cadet?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No. He just said, \"You don\\'t have to check inside.\"\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t have to check inside.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Well, then, as you wish, Trooper. Cadet, let\\'s move. Hurry it up!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I wish that worked from me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I wish it worked on you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': (Groans Loudly)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Zeb, will you be quiet?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': (Gasping) What? I need to breathe. Have you smelled me?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Huh. Don\\'t think it matters if you\\'re noisy. There\\'s nobody around. This was a good plan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Of course it was a good plan. We came up with that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': This way.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Somebody get Chopper.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper 1\\'\\'\\': You think we\\'ll find them this time?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper 2\\'\\'\\': We better.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Found me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': There\\'s a shuttle. What\\'d I tell ya?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You did good.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': (Gasps) Hera, over here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Shield generators.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Military grade.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Zeb, Ezra, grab all we can carry. These might help turn this day around. And The fleet could sure use them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Do you feel that?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (Exhales) The cold.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': (Mechanical Breathing)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Hera, go! We\\'ll cover you!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Kanan, look out!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': (Mechanical Breathing) Your master has deceived you into believing you can become a Jedi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': (Straining) (Grunts) (Groaning) (Groans)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Get read to fly us outta here!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': You know what I do in hopeless situations?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Yeah. (Chuckles) Blow stuff up.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Aim for the walkers.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (Screams) Now!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': It doesn\\'t kill him, what will?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not us. Run!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Go, Chop!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Come on! Come on! Ah!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': My lord, I will mobilize our fighters to pursue.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': That will be Quite unnecessary, Commander. The rebels will not leave the planet just yet.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Zeb, make sure they can\\'t track us.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Consider it done.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You all right?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': (Sighs) Yeah, I\\'ll live.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Kanan, what was that? Another Inquisitor?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (Exhales) No. Something worse.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': A Sith Lord. The ancient enemys of the Jedi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': (Stammers) How do we fight him?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Fight him? Ezra, we were both lucky to survive.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Then that settles it. I\\'m going to make for orbit so we can jump away.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Hera, no. He will have a blockade of Star Destroyers waiting for us.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': And this shuttle is slow, with barely any weapons or shields. (Scoffs) We\\'re gonna have to smuggle ourselves off Lothal for a change.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Hmm, that\\'s not a bad idea.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What are you thinking\\'?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I\\'m thinking we know the right Woman to smuggle us off-world.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Both\\'\\'\\': Not her!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': My lord, our scans have indicated that the stolen shuttle has not attempted to leave the system.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\':  Then Fear has driven them to the ground. There is a refuge camp the rebels have provided aid to in the past.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': Yes, \"Tarkintown\" they call it, You suspect the rebels are in hiding there?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': No, but I want you to be burning it. The compassions of the rebels is a sign of weakness. One that we will shall exploit.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': Yes, my lord.\\n*Denise Richards: (Hologram) Well, hello there, Captain Hera Syndulla. This is quite a pleasant surprise. What can I do for you guys?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': This isn\\'t a social call, Denise. It\\'s just business. We need your help to smuggling something off Lothal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Past the Imperial blockades.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Denise Richards\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) ok Well You know, if the Galactic Empire learns I gotten involved, it\\'d be all over for me. I\\'d be taking quite an awful big risk.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (Sighs) What do you want Denise?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Denise Richards\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) What have you guys got?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Imperial shield generators. Military grade.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Denise Richards\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) Ooh. Now that\\'s merchandise I can really move. How many are we talking about?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Two denise.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Denise richards\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) Two? You are no gambler, Hera. Offering me just two means you\\'ve got at least six, so I think, three is probably fair.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Fair? You\\'re taking half Denise.\\n*D\\'\\'\\'enise Richards\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) Those shields won\\'t do you any much good if you\\'re dead.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Three it is. So do we have a deal Denise?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Denise Richards\\'\\'\\': (Hologram) While I\\'m not on Lothal at the moment, my droid is. Go to my operations, and he\\'ll set you up with everything you guys need.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You must be Denise\\'s droid.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Denise\\'s Droid\\'\\'\\': Yes, ma\\'am. Welcome. I have prepared everything according to Ms.Richards\\'s instructions. Is one of you a mechanic?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Oh, that must be me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Definitely not you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Hey, kid!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Just let him go, Zeb.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': There\\'s no one. They\\'re all gone.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': They\\'re prisoners of the Galactic Empire now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': All I sense is evil. Why would they be burning Tarkintown?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': To spread fear, to make  us afraid. The people that lived here just got caught in the middle.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': This happened because of us?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': There\\'s a cost for any actions we take now, Ezra. Things are getting worse just as they did back when I was your age. But back then, there were 10, 000 Jedi Knights protecting the entire galaxy. Now...\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': There\\'s just you and me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Against the GALACTIC Empire.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We can fight! We have allies.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Do you not understand what you\\'re saying? You saw what we\\'re up against. Look!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I\\'m not afraid.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (Sighs) That\\'s what worries me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': What happened out there?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': The Empire burned Tarkintown.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Did anyone survive?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': The population\\'s been taken captive.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': (Growls) Let\\'s go bust \\'em out. Where\\'s my rifle?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No. He\\'d be waiting. You were right. We have no choice. We have to leave.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': For the good of Lothal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': So what\\'s the plan for gettin\\' out of here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Denise had these old transponders lying around. Sabine\\'s gonna tune their signatured codes to match this shuttle\\'s.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Sounds like a lousy Denise plan. (Chuckles)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': (Chuckles)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': No, it\\'s Denise\\'s gear. It was my plan. With these transponders beaming out the same signal as the shuttle, we should be able to slip by unnoticed.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Ooh, sounds like a lousy Sabine plan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Better than Denise\\'s.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician 1\\'\\'\\': Admiral, I\\'m scanning a ship leaving the planet surface in Sector 4. It\\'s transporter codes matches those of the stolen Imperial shuttle.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': Order all tie fighters to intercepting.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician 2\\'\\'\\': Sir, I\\'m scanning the same transponder in Sector 9.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': There must be a mistake. Re-scan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technnican 3\\'\\'\\': I\\'m tracking the identicaled signals in Sector 11 and Sector 5.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician 1\\'\\'\\': We have a TIE reporting in. It appears to be some kind of device sending out a signal. Delta Squadron is reporting another device.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': Order all our pilots to destroying them. The rebels are trying to masking their escape.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technican 4\\'\\'\\': Sir, one of the transponders is moving into orbit. It\\'s breaking out.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': All ships converge on that signal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Looks like they figured it out.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': It\\'s too late, boys. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician 5\\'\\'\\': The signal is gone. They\\'ve jumped.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\':Well Never thought I\\'d say this, but thank you, Denise richards.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': So if we can\\'t go back to Lothal, where are we going?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': What are you talking about Kanan? We\\'re all part of the Rebellion now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Are we hera? Are we all sure about what?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Maybe we could just grab the Ghost and lay low for a while.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I like fighting with Phoenix Squadron. Reminds me of the Honor Guards. Besides, they\\'re counting on us. Wouldn\\'t be right to abandon them now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Ezra, what do you think?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\'\\': We can\\'t help Lothal now, but I think the rebels and the federation of planets can help us get together, so we can go back and be  changeing things. I think we should stay with the rebel fleet and the federation.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': My lord, I regretted to inform you the rebels have escaped Lothal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': (Mechanical Breathing) Have my ship prepared at once.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstatine\\'\\'\\': Agent Kallus, I don\\'t think I understand.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': There is a tracking device hidden aboard that starfleet shuttle. Now ready the fleet to deploy immedately.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Enterprise-D Home, this is the Ghost away team. Clearance codes are 1-2-1-8-1-5-6. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': Your clearance codes checks out. Welcome home, Ghost team. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Chopper said a transmitter activated on our shuttle moments ago. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What does that mean?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': It means the Galactic Empire tracked us back to the rebel fleet. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Commander Sato! We need the rebel fleet and the federation to jumping out of here. Our shuttle was tracked by the empire.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': Commander, I\\'m scanning a ship in our sectors. We\\'ve been tracking one target. No other ships have entered the system. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Sato\\'\\'\\': Move Phoenix Squadron to intercepting. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Pilot\\'\\'\\': Fighter coming in mark 4. He\\'s coming in too fast! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Fleet, raise the deflector shields now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Pilot\\'\\'\\': We\\'ve lost Phoenixes 1 and 2. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': He\\'s heading right for us.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Pilot\\'\\'\\': Enemy fighter\\'s making for the command ship.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Sato\\'\\'\\': No can one outfighter best our entire squadron? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Your pilots are outmatched, Commander. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Uh, what are you doing?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Getting involved.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not without me, you\\'re not.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Let\\'s go. Ezra, come on!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka\\'\\'\\': All right if I tag along?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': The more, the merrier. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Everyone, check in.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Tail guns, check!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Turrets, check!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Nose guns, check! Check!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': All right, kids, do Mom and Dad proud,\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Here he comes.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': We\\'ve lost our rear shields! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Ghost now moving to engage.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I\\'m on him! Who is this guy?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': Sir, the last attack damaged the hyperdrive warp core! We are dead in space. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Sato\\'\\'\\': Enterprise-D to Ghost. We can\\'t withstand another attack from that fighter. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Copy that Enterprise-D. Phoenix Squadron form up and focus ur fire.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka\\'\\'\\': The force is strong with him. Kanan, let\\'s find out how strong.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': How can I help?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka\\'\\'\\': Just remember your training.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': (Exhales)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': Enemy ship closing to attacking range. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': There\\'s something familiar. I feel... Cold. I think I know who it is. Back on Lothal I felt something. Kanan did too. The fear. The anger. The hate. It\\'s the Sith Lord we faced. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': The apprentice lives.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka\\'\\'\\': (Screams)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Ahsoka?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': The Imperial pilot broke off his attack! They did it! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Sato\\'\\'\\': Captain Syndulla, whatever you\\'re doing, keep it up! so The fleet can recover! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No! Commandeer, you need to get the fleet out of here now!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Sato\\'\\'\\': I will not abandon our command ship. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You don\\'t have a choice, sir. Without a hyperdrive, you must abandon ship.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': Sir, we have Star Destroyers in Sector 5.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': Lord Vader, we have entered the star system and awaiting your orders.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': Have your star Destroyers to blocking their escape, but hold your fire. I want those rebels alive. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': It\\'s now or never, Commander. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Sato\\'\\'\\': I regretfully agree. All hands, abandon ship. You\\'ll have to keep that fighter occupied.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Don\\'t worry, sir. We seem to have his attention. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Suddenly, there\\'s a lot to do back here. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Sorry to spoil your fun, Zeb, but I\\'m ordering Chopper to divert all power to the hypderdrive system, including cannons.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Hera, what are you doing?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I think I know.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': Admiral, Lord Vader has separated one of the rebel ships from the rest of the fleet. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': Then that is our primary target.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Sato\\'\\'\\': Fleet and federation, commenceing hyperspace jump. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Copy that, Commander. We\\'ll meet you all at safe heaven.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': The fleet and federation is away. Get us out of here!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Everyone, hang on. Chopper, angle all main deflectors astern. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': The Star Destroyers aren\\'t the only ones firing at us! Now, do it fast!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': (Grunting)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': Target moving into range.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': Activate tractor beam on my signal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Hera!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Wait. Wait... \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': Now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Gotcha.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Technician\\'\\'\\': Status report on the rebel craft. Sir, we\\'ve locked onto a ship, but it\\'s not the rebel craft. It\\'s Lord Vader\\'s ship.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kassius Konstantine\\'\\'\\': Release... Release him immediately. It\\'s not your fault, Officer. But Lord Vader won\\'t know that. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Ahsoka, Hera said you wanted to speak with us. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka\\'\\'\\': Please, come in.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Are you okay?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka\\'\\'\\': I am, thank you. I wanted to ask about the Sith Lord you encountered on Lothal. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You know we\\'ve encountered an Inquisitor before., but this was nothing like that. The fear, the anger, the hate. You felt it. I haven\\'t sensed a presence like that since... \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka Tano\\'\\'\\': The Clone Wars. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Yeah.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Ahsoka, do you know who or what he is?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ahsoka\\'\\'\\': No, I don\\'t. But I do know that he will be coming. They\\'ll all be coming now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Then we\\'ve got to be ready to fight. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': We must find the strength to fight, but the greater courage is knowing when not to fight. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': And we\\'ll be beside you either way. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kallus\\'\\'\\': With their command ship destroyed, the rebel fleet and the federation fleet has been shattered. You have them on the run...\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': Clear the bridge now. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Emperess\\'\\'\\': Lord Vader, have you dealt with these rebels n the federation in the Lothal star system?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': Yes, my Master. They are simply broken. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Emperess\\'\\'\\': And yet I already sensed in you something more to your recent victory. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': I believe that the apprentice of general Anakin Skywalker still lives and is in league with these rebels and federation. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Emperess\\'\\'\\': Are you certain? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': It was her.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Emperess\\'\\'\\': This is an opportunity we cannot let it pass. General Skywalker\\'s apprentice could lead us to other last Jedis. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': Such as Obi-wan Kenobi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Emperess\\'\\'\\': Perhaps, if he still lives. Be patient, my old friend. But For now, be dispatching another Inquisitor to simply hunt them all down.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Darth Vader\\'\\'\\': As you wish, my master.\\n*\\'\\'\\'[End of The Siege of Lothal]\\'\\'\\'\\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels Transcripts]]'}, 'Empire Day': {'wikicontent': '*(This episode begins with Ezra)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra Bridger\\'\\'\\': Once we\\'ll begin, there\\'s no turning back.

Why now? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Had this feeling. [Gasps]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': [Crying]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Tseebo. Tseebo, it\\'s me, Ezra Bridger.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': [Crying Stops] [Electronic Chirping] [Speaking Huttese]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': That\\'s the Rodian the Imperials are hunting. You know him?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Name\\'s Tseebo. A friend of my parents. But something\\'s wrong. What\\'s that thing on his head?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Empire\\'s been known to implant lower level technicians with cybernetic circuits. Personality sacrificed for productivity. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': Tseebo\\'s productivity is 19% higher than average Imperial data worker.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Tseebo went to work for the Imperial information office after the Empire took my parents away.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Your parents? You never told us.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What\\'s to tell? They\\'ve been gone for eight years. I\\'ve been on my own since I was seven.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': Seven. Imperial [Speaking Huttese] \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What\\'s he saying?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': He\\'s detailing Imperial fighter deployments on Lothal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': That\\'s it. Tseebo has intel the Empire doesn\\'t want getting out. Sabine, can you access it\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Uh, think so. I need a few minutes.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Ezra. You okay?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I\\'m fine.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I told you, sometimes you have to let your guard down.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I said I\\'m fine.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': Ezra Bridger. Son of Ephraim and Mira Bridger. Born 15 years ago today.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Oh. Empire Day. It\\'s Ezra\\'s birthday.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': The risk you Bridgers take. Tseebo say you must think of your son. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ephraim\\'\\'\\': He\\'s all we think about! We\\'re teaching Ezra to stand up for people in need.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Mira\\'\\'\\': We\\'re fighting for our son\\'s freedom.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': Tseebo not fight battle Tseebo know cannot be won. Neither should Bridgers.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': You\\'ll want to see this.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Gasps, Sighs]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': What\\'s with the old disk?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': My folks used to do underground broadcasts from here, speaking out against the Empire. It\\'s probably just one of them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': [Babbling] \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What are we looking at? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': It\\'s [Exhales] well, it\\'s everything. Imperial specs on the new TIEs and new T-8 Disruptors. Schedules of troop movements, tactics and strategies. Half of it\\'s encrypted, but it looks like there\\'s a five-year plan for Lothal and every other world in the Outer Rim.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': [Groans]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': No wonder his brain\\'s shorting out. All that data\\'d overload anyone.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': The secrets in his head must be damaging to the Empire. We\\'ll need to smuggle him off Lothal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Gotta smuggle him out of town first. You know the only reason the Imperials haven\\'t caught him yet is because their forces were occupied with Empire Day. But the day\\'s almost done.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine & Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Groans]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Pilot\\'\\'\\': Tear open every rathole in the sector. Find that Rodian.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': [Groans] I miss Zeb.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Pilot\\'\\'\\': What?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Come on, Tseebo. Move it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tseebo\\'\\'\\': [Speaking Huttese]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Shh!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Pilot\\'\\'\\': [Groans] \\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Commandant Aresko. An Imperial troop transport has been reported stolen from the Lower City. I\\'m on my way, but do not let it pass.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commandant Aresko\\'\\'\\': Acknowledged. We\\'re ready. Positions! That\\'s far enough, rebel scum.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I have no plans on stopping.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': That\\'s good to know!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commandant Aresko\\'\\'\\': Stop! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Punch it! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Commandant Aresko\\'\\'\\': Fire! Stop, I said! I-I said stop!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Laughing]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': This is Agent Kallus, ISB-021, calling the Inquisitor. The rebels are through the main gate and headed South.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Their ship will be waiting. Slow them down. We\\'re on our way.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Pilot\\'\\'\\': The Rodian! [Grunting]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Get me closer.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Remember me?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Specter-5 to Ghost. We\\'re coming in hot.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Can see that. You got company upstairs.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Take them down!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\':  Shields holding, but I need that transport taken out.

Pull over, and we\\'ll--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Belay that. Have to be a scoop job.

I don\\'t know.\\nThousands.\\nProbably tens of thousands.\\nNever kept count like some of the boys.\\nThey don\\'t look very dangerous.\\nListen, those droids wiped out a lot of Republic troopers.\\nMany of them were my friends.\\nRex has been through a lot.\\nBattles leave scars, some you can\\'t see.\\nHold up.\\nLet me recon first.\\nWell, look at that.\\nWe hit pay dirt.\\nThe munitions depot is fully loaded.\\nMore proton bombs in there than we can carry.\\n- Good job, Rex.\\n- Way to go, Captain.\\nVOICE: Roger, roger.\\n(CHOPPER GRUNTING) Hey, careful, kid.\\nThe droids used to protect their armories with ray shields.\\nWhat\\'s a ray shiel This is a ray shield.\\nLook! Aren\\'t those battle droids? I thought they were all shut down.\\nZEB: Well, these weren\\'t.\\nYou have been captured by the Separatist Alliance.\\n- Huh? - Separatists? BATTLE DROID: Prepare to blast the Republic invaders.\\nRepublic invaders? Belay that order.\\n- Uh-huh.\\nUh-huh.\\n- (CHATTERING OVER COMLINK) - Roger, roger.\\n- Wait, who\\'s Roger? We have new orders, incapacitate and capture.\\n- Activating stunner.\\n- ALL: No! (ALL GRUNTING) Take them to the command center.\\nWe haven\\'t captured anyone in years.\\nWe haven\\'t captured anyone ever.\\n(GRUNTING) Ugh.\\nWhere Where are we? DROID: How intriguing.\\nWell done, B1-268.\\nBATTLE DROID: Roger, roger.\\nOh, no.\\nThe war, it\\'s not over! KANAN: Rex.\\nRex! Cody! Talk to me.\\nAh, Kanan.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI thought you were someone else.\\nI need you here now, buddy.\\nWe\\'re in the usual mess.\\nI think the commander\\'s a super tactical droid.\\nAh, you\\'re right.\\nHe is.\\n- Is that bad? - It\\'s really bad.\\nThat droid\\'s extremely intelligent.\\nNear the end of the war, Separatist droids significantly outnumbered Republic units.\\nBy my calculations, our probability of being defeated was only 23.\\n6%.\\nAfter Clone Order 66, the whole droid army was given a shutdown command.\\nHow are you even operating? The Jedi betrayal ended the war for most of the galaxy.\\nBut here on Agamar, I assumed it was a Republic trick and prevented the shutdown command.\\nWell, it doesn\\'t matter how it ended.\\nThe war is over.\\nLet us go.\\nNegative, Captain.\\nI calculate that this will be my only opportunity to end the Clone Wars as I planned, with a victory for the Separatist Alliance.\\nWhat do you want us to do, surrender? On the contrary, I want you to fight, to prove, once and for all, whose tactical strategy was superior.\\nWell, you can count me out.\\nI\\'m not playing some stupid war game.\\nThat is correct, Lasat.\\nYour species were not in the Clone Wars, so you will be the hostage your allies must save.\\nThe \"Jedi Rescue\" is a recurring scenario based on 132 battles I have reviewed.\\nYeah, we\\'ve done it a few times.\\nJedi, is this your Padawan? - Most of the time.\\n- Good.\\nA complete set of Republic opponents will make this authentic.\\nNo, it won\\'t, because we\\'re not fighting.\\nIf you will not fight, you will be terminated.\\n- I\\'ll fight your Clone War.\\n- What? Ezra, no! Hey, you both talk about the Clone Wars.\\nWhat it was like, the good and the bad.\\nI wanna help you win this last battle.\\nBesides, look at them.\\nHow can we lose? Uh, hey.\\n(SIGHS) Okay, it might be easier to fight them head-on than to get out of our current dilemma.\\n(EXHALES) Fine.\\nFine, we\\'ll do it.\\nOkay, but if we win, Zeb goes free, and we take all the proton bombs in the hangar.\\nI accept your terms.\\nThe commander has initiated Battle Plan Zeta.\\nTake your positions at once.\\nALL: Roger, roger.\\nBATTLE DROID: Battle Plan Zeta? Finally! (GRUNTING) (BEEPING) How much fuel did we get before the ambush? Enough for the whole fleet.\\nI just hope Kanan and Rex aren\\'t expecting us back on Agamar anytime soon.\\nIf Kanan needs help, he\\'ll call us.\\nSince when? Fine.\\nIf Chopper\\'s in over his head, he\\'ll hide and call us.\\nSABINE: That\\'s more believable! Congratulations.\\nYour plan to ambush them at the fuel depot worked like a charm.\\nOnly if we catch them.\\nExcuse me, Governor.\\nWe\\'ve intercepted a rebel transmission from the Agamar system before it was received by the rebel ship.\\nThe message is encrypted, but it repeats like a distress signal.\\nInteresting.\\nThe rebels there must be desperate for help that will never come.\\nLocate the nearest Imperial outpost to Agamar and deploy them.\\nImmediately.\\nTACTICAL DROID: (ON PA) The objective of this battle is simple.\\nYou must fight your way back to my command center and capture it to free your friend.\\nRex, you\\'ve got more battlefield experience than either of us.\\nYou lead.\\nAll right.\\nOur first goal is to get inside the hangar.\\nKalani is a war machine, programmed to kill, and he\\'s got the numbers and the firepower to do it.\\nOur only chance is to be aggressive, surprise him, hopefully put him on the defensive.\\nHow many droids do you think he has? KALANI: The last battle will begin now.\\nA lot.\\nHe has a lot of droids! We\\'ve gotta scatter them.\\nUse the sword and shield maneuver.\\nWait.\\nWhat does that mean? We block, he fires.\\n- Everybody ready? - Yep! Let\\'s go! Ezra, get ready to duck! Okay! Now! Again! That scattered \\'em! Everybody forward! Ezra, form it up! (GRUNTS) We\\'ve gotta stay together.\\nThe hangar looks clear.\\nLet\\'s go.\\n- Wait.\\nThat\\'s not how it normally goes.\\n- What\\'s wrong? The droids usually keep coming, wave after wave.\\nThat tactical droid has had a long time to think about this.\\nAnd remember, he wants to win.\\nI\\'m surprised it means so much to him.\\nYeah, it means a lot to his programming.\\nIt means a lot to mine as well.\\nYour programming? We clones were bred for combat.\\nWith few exceptions, there was no other way of life for us.\\nWe should move.\\nRight, Commander.\\nUh, Kanan.\\nLooks like my friends are doing pretty good.\\nYou might as well surrender now.\\nI am not programmed to comprehend your humor.\\nI\\'m not joking.\\nHa, ha, ha.\\nYour Republic friends have taken the bait.\\nSend in the destroyers.\\nIncoming! KANAN: Ezra, get back! They\\'re too dangerous.\\nCan\\'t advance with those destroyers up there.\\nThere\\'s no way to breach their shields.\\nLook! That crane! I bet we can use it to take out the catwalk.\\n- I\\'ll make a run for it.\\n- We\\'ll draw their attention.\\nThere\\'s gonna be a lot of fire.\\nWe\\'ll have to be quick.\\nEzra, move as fast as you can.\\nYou can count on me.\\nAh, the Jedi have split up, as they do 76% of the time.\\nSquad six, advance.\\nMove in! REX: More droids! We\\'ve gotta take cover.\\nHey! (GASPS) (GRUNTS) Hmm, Chop, where\\'ve you been? (GRUNTING) How\\'d you send a distress signal? (GRUNTING) Mmm! I\\'m kinda in the middle of something.\\n(INSISTENT GRUNTING) Okay, okay! A shuttle! It\\'s a good find, Chop.\\nBut we\\'re not leaving without Zeb.\\nSo you get it running and I\\'ll get the others.\\n(GRUNTING) Where is that kid? We\\'re gonna get trapped here.\\nWe need to move.\\nNow.\\nNo, Rex.\\nWait! You all right? (CHUCKLES) I\\'m good.\\nGeneration one armor always holds up.\\nNo ray shields this time.\\nWell, that went just as planned, more or less.\\n- I make a pretty good soldier, huh? - No.\\nA good soldier follows orders.\\nThat plan was based on timing and execution.\\nAnd you took too long! - But Chopper wanted to show me - This is not a game! This is life and death! Every move you make affects the rest of us.\\nIf we\\'re gonna survive this, we\\'re gonna do it with strategy and discipline.\\nIt\\'s not you.\\nHe needs to finish this battle his way.\\nJust like that droid.\\nRex, get between us! REX: Ezra, incoming! Push and fire, now! (GROANS) It worked! Shield overheated.\\nThat droid\\'s too old.\\nHuh.\\nJust like me.\\nYou okay? Yeah, I\\'ll be fine.\\n(DOOR OPENS) Well, looks like we win.\\nI disagree, Captain.\\nRex, no! Don\\'t! We didn\\'t win.\\nThese droids are so old, they malfunctioned.\\nIf they hadn\\'t, we\\'d be goners.\\nThe boy is correct.\\nThe droid army would have prevailed.\\nSo, technically, victory is ours.\\nNo, it\\'s not! I never really thought about it.\\nI never asked.\\nI know the Jedi were wiped out, the clones were decommissioned, and the droid army was just shut down.\\nThe Clone War ended, but why? If none of you won, who did? ZEB: Uh, the Empire.\\nZeb, that\\'s right! How did you know? Because they\\'re here, and they\\'re about to win again.\\nI\\'ve got a new calculation for you.\\nWhat are the chances your droid army can defeat the Empire? My resources are depleted.\\nHowever, the droid army is not currently at war with the Galactic Empire.\\nYou wanna bet? - Unit B1-268, analyze the threat.\\n- Roger, roger.\\nMove in.\\n(WEAPONS COCKING) Is that what I think it is? Greetings.\\nI am unit B1-268.\\nMy commander has sent me - to report your intentions.\\n- Yeah.\\nClone Wars battle droid.\\n- Surprised its battery hasn\\'t run out.\\n- Um, are we Don\\'t see many of these anymore.\\nOh, no.\\nAnd when you do, there\\'s usually a bunch of them.\\nAll right, you know the drill.\\nGreetings.\\n(SCREAMING) Oh, my I think we face a common enemy now.\\nAh, wait a minute! Let him finish, Captain.\\nClones? Battle droids? You destroyed each other.\\nAnd when you were both weak enough, the Empire took over.\\nGeneral, what were the Separatists fighting for? According to my programming, freedom from the tyranny of the Republic.\\nHmm, fighting tyranny.\\nSounds like the Empire has always been your enemy.\\nYou are against the Empire.\\nI am against the Republic.\\nNow the Republic has become the Empire.\\nI accept your logic.\\n- We are on the same side.\\n- Sorry.\\nI guess we are.\\nHowever, as I stated, my forces are too depleted for me to plan a successful counterattack.\\nFighting insurmountable odds? We can help you with that.\\n(AGITATED GRUNTING) Yes, Chopper, we know the Empire is here.\\nHow\\'s the shuttle coming? Shuttle? What shuttle? The one I tried to tell you about earlier.\\nWe have three Sheathipede-class shuttles, but they have no weapons.\\nNo, but they can get us outta here.\\nA successful retreat is improbable.\\nThe walkers will destroy the ships before they escape the hangar.\\nWe don\\'t have the firepower to take on walkers.\\nWhat about the bombs we came here for? We have no cannon to fire the shells.\\nOtherwise, I would have used them on you.\\nOh, thanks.\\n- We\\'re running out of time! - REX: Ah, we roll \\'em! The proton bombs.\\nWe roll \\'em across the hangar and into the feet of the walkers.\\nThen we blast \\'em! My battle droids are not accurate.\\nHowever, you are, Master Jedi.\\nI don\\'t understand.\\nMy droids will line up and fire at you and your apprentice.\\nYou two will then redirect their blaster bolts toward the shells more accurately, thus setting off more targets than my droids could hit alone.\\nWell, this takes trust to a whole new level.\\n(SIGHS) Chopper, get the munitions ready to roll.\\nREX: Ready, Zeb? (SIGHS) One last glorious day in the Grand Army of the Republic.\\nChopper, have the shuttle ready to go! KANAN: D squad, get ready! I have never attempted such a desperate strategy.\\nThat\\'s why we always won.\\nNot always.\\nHey, guys, focus on the present.\\nOnce those shells explode, get to your shuttles.\\nBOTH: Roger, roger.\\n(BEEPING) Now! Fire.\\nThis might be our only chance.\\nGet to the ships! I made it! I made it! Aaah! Lead shuttle, bank right! Bank right! We made it! General, do you read us? Affirmative.\\nWe have survived the battle.\\nIt was not a victory, but a successful strategy nonetheless.\\nNo, it was a victory.\\nWe all just won the Clone War, and you ended it, Ezra.\\nA galaxy of senators couldn\\'t do that.\\nAn army of Jedi, clones and droids couldn\\'t find the middle ground, but you did.\\nRex, all I did was point out that none of you were meant to win.\\n- You couldn\\'t.\\n- And we needed to hear it.\\nKALANI: Agreed.\\nI am satisfied if you are, Captain.\\nI am.\\nVery good.\\nNow, based upon this battle, I calculate that you have less than a one percent chance of staging a successful rebellion against the Empire, so this is where we must part ways.\\nRoger, roger.\\nI can\\'t imagine fighting that many droids all the time.\\n(CHUCKLES) Well, if you think that was bad, let me tell you about the Battle of Geonosis.\\nHERA: (ON COMLINK) This is Ghost to away team.\\nSpectre-1, are you there? Hera, I was just about to call you.\\nHow was your day? We\\'re tracking two shuttles leaving the system.\\nIs everything all right? Did you have trouble securing the bombs? Well, the bad news is, we didn\\'t get the bombs.\\nThe good news is, we don\\'t need a pickup because we found a new Phantom.\\nTell Sabine she\\'s gonna need a paint job.\\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels Transcripts]]'}, 'Rise of the Old Masters': {'wikicontent': '*(This episode begins with Ezra)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Focus.

But Master Yoda sure used to say it a lot.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Yawning] I really thought this Jedi stuff would be more interesting. No wonder the old religion died.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid Language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Do something.

You need to learn to focus through them. Here. Let\\'s try something else.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': When do I get my own?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Having a laser sword doesn\\'t make you a Jedi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Gets me closer.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Careful! There\\'s a control on the side that adjusts the length to your height.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I think it should be a little shorter.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Laughing]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Okay. Close your eyes. Let him have it, Chopper.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Ow! [Grunts]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Be precise. Keep the blade [Groans] up.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Laughs] That\\'s it, kid.

You\\'re undisciplined and full of self-doubt.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': And whose fault is that, Master?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Sighs] It\\'s difficult to teach.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': He means it\\'s difficult to teach you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Kanan?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Shh. You made the Holonet.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': The stolen TIE fighter was later used to attack a transport full of innocent workers.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': You liar! We set \\'em free.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Gall Trayvis\\'\\'\\': Citizens, this is Senator-in-exile Gall Trayvis. I bring more news the Empire doesn\\'t want you to hear.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What\\'s a Gall Trayvis?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': The only member of the Imperial Senate with the courage to speak out publicly against the Empire.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Gall Trayvis\\'\\'\\': One of the Republic\\'s greatest peacekeepers, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli, is alive. She has been imprisoned unlawfully somewhere in the Stygeon system. As citizens, we demand the Emperor produce Master Unduli and grant her a fair trial before the entire Sen--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': Marking another successful planetary liberation utilizing the Base Delta Zero initiative.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': This Luminara You knew her?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I met her. Once. She was a great Jedi Master brave, compassionate, disciplined. In fact, she\\'d make an excellent teacher for you. There\\'ve always been rumors she survived the Clone Wars, but they never came with a specific location before. We can\\'t pass this up.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Was hoping you\\'d say that. I\\'ll set course for the Stygeon system.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': The rest of you, prep for an op.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Laughs]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You hear that? He\\'s done with me. He\\'s gonna pawn me off on some stranger.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Chuckling, chattering]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Welcome to the Spire on Stygeon Prime, the only Imperial detainment facility in the Stygeon system. And it\\'s impregnable.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': That\\'s never stopped us before.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': [Chuckles] Trust me, we have never faced anything like this. It\\'s a real work of art. Blast proof, ray shielded, protected by anti-ship weapons, TIE fighters and short and long range scanners.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We can fool the scanners.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Eh, maybe. But that just leaves an army of troopers and guard posts on all the walls. Look, even if we get into this beauty, the hard part\\'s getting out. \\'Cause, you know, it\\'s a prison.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What about going in low and sneaking onto this landing platform?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Mm-mmm. Platform has a heavy trooper presence and reinforced blast doors. Impossible to get in or out that way.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Here. There\\'s only room for a couple guards. We take them down, make our way to the upper level isolation cells, free Luminara and come back out the way we came in.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Yeah. You\\'d have to be crazy to try that lousy plan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Let\\'s hope the Empire thinks so too.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Droid language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Oh, I\\'m sorry, Chop. We just don\\'t need your damaged logic circuits on this one.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [Chattering in droid language]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Thirty seconds. Good luck.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Luck? We\\'re gonna need a miracle.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Here are three.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Try to stay focused.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Thought there was no \"try.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Kid, wait! What are you doing?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': [Groans]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Nice and quiet-like--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yelling] [Grunting] [Loud thud]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': What just happened? You were supposed to exit with Zeb. You\\'re lucky every stormtrooper in the prison doesn\\'t know we\\'re here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Whoa!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtroopers\\'\\'\\': [Grunts]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': [Screams]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Stunts like that put us all in jeopardy. That is exactly why you need Master Luminara to teach you discipline.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I was just following your example.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Yeah? Well, try to stay focused and follow the plan instead.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I hate to interrupt, but we need the kid to unlock the door.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I got it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Ezra.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Quiet. I\\'m focusing. [Buzzing, squawking continue] You\\'re welcome. Ow!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': You did your job. You want a medal?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Luminara\\'s here. I sense her presence, but it\\'s clouded. Where\\'s Master Unduli?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Detention block CC-01. Isolation cell 0169.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': They have isolation cells on the lower levels? We planned off outdated schematics.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What does that mean?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': It means the plan changes.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': You got a backup plan?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Figuring one out right now. Zeb, Sabine, you\\'re coming along.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Weren\\'t we supposed to hold our escape route here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Now the turbolift is our escape route. Let\\'s go.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': [Scoffs] His plan gets worse all the time.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Just hope he doesn\\'t change it again.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I\\'m standing right here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine and Zeb\\'\\'\\': We know.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Uh-oh. Company. Whoa! Okay, you\\'re not a TIE fighter. Hey! Watch it, buddy. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sabine\\'s jammer is operating on the same frequency as these creatures. It\\'s sending out a mating call? You lovebirds are attracting too much attention. Hope I\\'m not needed anytime soon.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtroopers\\'\\'\\': [Grunting]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Maintain comm silence. And whatever you do, hold this lift.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Hey, you! Stop!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Wow. You\\'re really not messing around tonight.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': There\\'s a lot more at stake than you realize.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Grumbles]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Ever seen this Jedi Master?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Don\\'t have the clearance.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Shouldn\\'t you be guarding the Jedi\\'s cell? It\\'s on the next level.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': It\\'s on the next level.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You better get moving.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': We better get moving.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': When do I learn that?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Luminara will teach you much better than I could.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Is it really her?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Yes, but something\\'s wrong. Master? [Gasps]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What happened to her? I don\\'t understand.\\n*\\'\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': No? It doesn\\'t seem complicated. I am the Inquisitor. Welcome. Yes, I\\'m afraid Master Luminara died with the Republic. But her bones continue to serve the Empire luring the last Jedi to their ends.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Comlink chirps] Spectre-3, come in. It\\'s a trap!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': There will be no reinforcements. Interesting. It seems you trained with Jedi Master Depa Billaba.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': How Who are you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': The temple records are quite complete. In close quarter fighting, Billaba\\'s emphasis was always on form 3, which you favor to a ridiculous degree. Clearly, you were a poor student. Is that really all you\\'ve got, my boy?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [Detonator beeping] Well, I\\'ve got that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Spectre-5 to Spectre-1. Come in. [Static] Thought so. They\\'re jamming our signal. They know we\\'re here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Here in this lift or--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Here, period! They lured us in upstairs at the prison\\'s weak point. We\\'re expected to exit the same way, so you can bet there will be troopers waiting for us. We\\'d never make it out of the lift.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': So what do we do?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Well, time for a miracle.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Are you paying attention, boy? The Jedi are dead, but there is another path the dark side.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Never heard of it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Have you taught him nothing? [Shouts]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Hold your fire!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': That\\'s one lift off-line.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I\\'ve disabled the other two. There are other ways down, but it\\'ll take \\'em a while. Let\\'s go.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Do you really think you can save the boy? For his sake, surrender. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I\\'m not making deals with you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Hmm. Then we\\'ll let him make one, shall we?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': [Yelps, grunts]\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Your master cannot save you, boy. He is unfocused and undisciplined. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Then we\\'re perfect for each other.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': I do so admire your persistence. Ready to die? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No! Run!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Does yours do that?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Come on! Let\\'s go! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Guys! This way! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You figured out it was a trap?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Yeah. Luminara?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Long gone. Our new exit? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Landing platform.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Thought it was impossible to get out that way. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Well, let\\'s hope the Empire thinks so too.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': [over PA] Secure the facility. Full lockdown.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, that\\'s not helpful.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [Grunts] Can\\'t do this all day! Go!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I\\'ve got it.

At least we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re even.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Even? Please. I had the whole situation under control.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [groans] Come here!\\n<br />'''Stormtrooper''': Where they go?\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [grunts]\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Whoa!\\n<br />'''Stormtrooper''': Up there!\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Zeb!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Just keep going.

Hey, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any meilooruns, do you?\\n<br />'''Valen Rudor''': There is nowhere to hide. Commander, take this monster in for questioning. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s find out why he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s running.\\n<br />'''Stormtrooper''': Hands up!\\n<br />'''Valen Rudor''': [whimpers]\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Never actually flown one of these before. Whoa!\\n<br />'''Stormtrooper''': Look out!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [laughing] Ha, ha, ha! Too bad the kid wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t here to see that. Whoa! [laughs] Whew. On the other hand--\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Great. Just what I need. Zeb? Zeb! Hey, Zeb, let me in!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': So now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be saving your life, right?\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': What? Yeah, sure. Yes! Whatever!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': I let you in, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re even.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Fine!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': You have to say it!\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': All right, all right.

Sorry, Hera. No entry.\\n<br />'''Hera''': You do realize this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t your room?\\n<br />'''Sabine''': I was inspired.

Could be my room.\\n\\n(''At Outside'')\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [''grunting'']\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re too low.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': How can you tell?

Go ahead, Spectre-4.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Right. well, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve has a bit of a problem.\\n<br />'''Hera''': I thought you might. Look, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about the meilooruns.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Yeah, meilooruns. Uh, we found some. But we lost them. Then we found them again. But we smashed them.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Just cut to the chase, kid.\\n<br />'''Kanan''': Wait! What am I hearing? It sounds like--\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Yeah, about that. See, um-- well-- [quickly] We stole a TIE Fighter.\\n<br />'''Kanan''': YOU WHAT?!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking it better than I thought.\\n<br />'''Kanan''': Get rid of it!\\n<br />'''Both''': Do we have to?\\n<br />'''Kanan''': [sighs] At least tell me you dismantled the locater beacon.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [laughs] Of course.

I-I mean\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 got it a long time ago. You know, back when we first boarded. Right away. Immediately.\\n<br />'''Kanan''': Stealing a TIE attracts unwanted attention. Rendezvous at Shadow Site 2 Fly straight there. Do not stop. And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': On our way. Spectre-4 out.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': That went well.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Yeah.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Do you know which way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re supposed to go?\\n<br />'''Zeb''': No idea.\\n<br />'''Mr. Sumar''': I told you before-- we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not selling this farm.\\n<br />'''Lyste''': You misunderstand.

Please.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [Sighs] Friends of yours?\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Of my parents.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a convo of troop transports heading northwest. Uh, karablast!

Here goes nothing. Attention, transports. This is Imperial Commander Meiloorun.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Meiloorun? Seriously?\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Shh. [clears throat] There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a report of rebel activity in your sector. Reduce speed.\\n<br />'''Lyste''': Acknowledged, Commander. Reduce speed.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': You sure, kid?\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Just get me in close. [grunts]\\n<br />'''Lyste''': A TIE fighter? This is Supply Master Lyste, LSM-03. My men reported a stolen TIE.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the TIE you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a totally different TIE. I sent it to, uh, seek out the rebels.\\n<br />'''Lyste''': Commander, repeat your operating number.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [imitating static] Sorry. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t catch that. But maintain current position.\\n<br />'''Lyste''': All transports, resume speed. And man the cannon. You see that TIE again, take your shot.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking Commander Meiloorun\\xe2\\x80\\x99s orders anymore.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Mr. Sumar!\\n<br />'''Mr. Sumar''': Ezra?\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Hold on. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have you out soon. [Grunts]\\n<br />'''Mr. Sumar''': You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never reach it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too dangerous.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Okay, you can do this. [Beeps] I knew I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get the hang of that.\\n<br />'''Pilot''': Sir, someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unlocked the prisoners on Transport 3.\\n<br />'''Lyste''': I want troopers up top, now!\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': You have to jump. Jump and scatter.\\n<br />'''Mr. Sumar''': We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving too fast!\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': So you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather stay prisoners?\\n<br />'''All''': [grunting]\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Whoa.\\n<br />'''Pilot''': Sir, the prisoners are escaping.\\n<br />'''Lyste''': Open fire.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': That gun turret\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna be a problem. This bird has no shields.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Working on it. Well, hello, stranger.\\n<br />'''Stormtrooper''': Maintain fire. His shots won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t penetrate your armor. What the Aaah!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Not bad, kid.\\n<br />'''Stormtrooper''': Gotcha.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Whoa.\\n<br />'''Stormtrooper''': Wait! You did all this for fruit?\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': No! Okay, maybe a little. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gotta be something useful in here. A wrench? A wrench! All for fruit! [Gasps] Not bad, ace.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Gotcha!\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Uh, how are you flying this thing?\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [grunting]\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Thanks for the save. Guess I owe you now.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just say we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re eternally even. Oh. You collect these, right?\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Already have that one. But this is a nice one. Besides, maybe I can get Sabine to paint it for me. So thanks. So, what do we do about the TIE? [chuckling]\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [grunts]\\n<br />'''Both''': [chuckling]\\n<br />'''Kanan''': Ah, they should have been here by now.\\n<br />'''Hera''': Over there!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': One fresh meiloorun, as ordered.\\n<br />'''Hera''': Thank you, kind sir.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Team effort.\\n<br />'''Kanan''': Forget about the fruit. Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the TIE fighter?\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [sighs] I crashed it.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': On purpose. Uh, we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it to fall back into the Empire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands.\\n<br />'''Kanan''': That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I like to hear.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [sighs, chuckles]\\n<br />'''Both''': [laughs]\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [grunts, laughing]\\n<br />'''Sabine''': Finished.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Uh, finished with what, Sabine?\\n<br />'''Sabine''': Thought it was a moment that needed to be immortalized.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': [grumbling]\\n<br />'''Sabine''': And you did say you wanted to be my inspiration.\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Yeah, but that makes me look like a fool.\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Makes me look like a bigger fool.\\n<br />'''Sabine''': I paint what I see.\\n<br />'''Chopper''': [laughs, blows raspberry]\\n<br />'''Zeb''': Chopper!\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': This was all your fault!\\n<br />'''Chopper''': [chittering]\\n<br />'''Ezra Bridger''': Come back, you metal menace!\\n<br />'''Zeb''': I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m tearing that rust bucket apart!

My name\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ezra. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yours?

You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not the first on Lothal hit by this crew.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Cumberlayne Aresko\\'\\'\\': That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a relief. I mean-- I assume that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here, Agent Kallus.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': The Imperial Security Bureau pays attention to patterns. When the Empire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations are targeted on an ongoing basis, it could signify something more than the theft if a few crates It could signify the spark of rebellion. Next time they make a more, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be waiting for them-- to snuff out that spark before it catches fire.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Let go. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep me here. Take me back to Lothal.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Calm down. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Wait. Right now? With Imperials chasing us?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We lost the Ties when we jumped, and the Ghost can scramble its signature\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 so they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize us when we return.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Oh. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty good. So just drop me and my blasters outside Capital City and--\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not your blasters.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going back to Capital City. The job\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not done.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Hey, where are they going?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': If I told you, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to kill you. Oh, and I might just kill you anyway.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Grab a crate, pull your weight.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Lived on Lothal my whole life. Never been here.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': The Imperials don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t advertise it.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Locals call it Tarkintown.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Named for Grand Moff Tarkin, Governor of the Rim. He kicked these folks off their farms when the Empire wanted their land.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Anybody tried to fight back got arrested-- for tresson.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Any problems procuring these lovely ladies?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Nothing we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t handle, Vizago. Your intel was accurate-- this time.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We got the goods and took a bite out of the Empire. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all that matters.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Business is all that matters. But I love that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Keep going.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': I could. Or I could stop and trade the rest of the bounty\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 for another bit of intel you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re been begging after.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': The Wookiees?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': The Wookiees?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Who wants free grub?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Citizen\\'\\'\\': Yes. Yes.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Citizen\\'\\'\\': Much appreciated.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Citizen\\'\\'\\': Please, please.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Citizen\\'\\'\\': Thank you. Thank you.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Alien\\'\\'\\': Thank you. Thank you so much.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I-- I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'electronic chitering\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Okay. Weird. Might be worth something. Whoa.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Careful. You;; cut your arm off.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'Droid language\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Look, I know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not gonna believe me, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like this thing wanted me to take it.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe you. Now hand me the lightsaber.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Lightsaber? Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that the weapon of the Jedi?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Give it to me and get out. Now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see/\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Not too good at following directions, are you?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Not so much. You?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'chuckles\\'\\'] Never been my specialty.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Who are you people? I mean, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not thieves exactly.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not exactly anything. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a crew, a team, in some ways a family.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What happened to your real family?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': The Empire. What happened to yours?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Kanan wants us in the common room. If he tries anything, sound the alarm. Or shoot him.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'Droid language\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Shush. Just watch him.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Sabine. My name\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sabine.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'Droid language\\'\\'] [\\'\\'electronic raspberry\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': We have a new mission. Vizago acquired the flight plan for an Imperial transport ship full of Wookiee prisoners. \\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Most of these Wookiees were soldiers for the Old Republic.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I owe those hairy beasts. They saved some of my people.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Mine too.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save them, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a tight window. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been taken to an unknown slave labor camp. If we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t intercept this ship, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never find them. Now, I have a plan. But.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'grunts, groans\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I ordered Chopper to keep watch.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'Droid language\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'growls\\'\\'] Can we please get rid of him?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': No. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. The kid knows too much.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have time to take him home anyway. We need to move now. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep an eye on him.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You know, this whole mission thing is nuts. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not against sticking it to the Empire, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d stick my neck out this far. Who does it?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We do. Imperial transport 651, this is Starbird coming inbound.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': State your business.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Bounty. We captured an additional Wookiee prisoner and have transfer orders to place him with you.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': We have no such orders.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. We already got paid by Governor Tarkin. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the oversize monong, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll jettison here, let you explain to your superiors why the Empire has one less slave.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': Permission to dock. Bay 1.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': That thing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a Wookiee.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you ever seen a rare hairless Wookiee before?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'Imitates Wookiee growl\\'\\'] Oh, forget it. Told you they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy it.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': You didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly give \\xe2\\x80\\x98em a chance to buy it.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Ah. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just something about the feel of their helmets on my fists. [\\'\\'Chuckles\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Okay. You know the plan. Move out. No troopers. Security\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soft.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Spectre-1, come in. Spectre-4? Spectre-5? Ah, comm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down. No, not down. Jammed.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Something\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an Imperial Star Destroyer.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': This whole thing was a setup.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beginning to look that way.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Prepare to board.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You need to board the transport and warn them.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What? Why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you do it?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I need to be ready to take off, or none of us stands a chance.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': No. No way. Why would I risk my life for a bunch of strangers?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Because Kanan risked his for you. If all you do is fight for your own life, then your life is worth nothing. They need you, Ezra. They need you right now. Listen. Our crew boarded that transport to selflessly rescue Imperial prisoners. They have no idea they walked into a trap, no idea what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming. You need to go warn them, Ezra.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too late for them, Hera. We should run now, while--\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I do. I swear I do. Which is why I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing this.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I can.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': Welcome aboard, Agent Kallus. The rebels are headed for the brig, where quite the surprise awaits.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No guards on the door.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Just set the detonator so we can get the Wookiees out of here. [\\'\\'Electronic whine\\'\\'] At least things seem to be going smoother than our last op.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a trap! We gotta get out of here. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a trap!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Karabast! The kid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blowing another op.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an op. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a trap. Hera sent me to warn you. Run!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'yelping\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': We need to warn Sabine and Chopper, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve jammed the comm.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll follow the plan. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be fine.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yeah, \\xe2\\x80\\x98cause the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone just great so far.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'Droid language\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Chopper, stop grumbling and work that gravity generator.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'grunts\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the backup ready.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Push off now!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Now.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': What the\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Artificial gravity is down for two minutes.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Hey! Aah! [\\'\\'grunting\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'grunting\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You doing okay, kid?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You kidding? Oh!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Five, four get ready two, one, now.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Now!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'All\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'grunts\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Where are the Wookiees?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No Wookiees. Sabine, man the nose gun. Chop, tell Hera to take off.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Uh right!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'gasps\\'\\'] Let go!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Kid, get out of the way!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Sorry, kid! You did good.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'panting\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'Droid language\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': There. Airlock shut. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out of here!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'sighs\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Chop, jam their tractor beam!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'Droid Language\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': Attention, rebel ship. Surrender or be destroyed. This is your first and last warning.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Blow it out your exhaust vent. [\\'\\'electronic chuckling\\'\\'] Literally. Sabine.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'rapid beeping\\'\\'] Ah, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see it from here. How\\xe2\\x80\\x99d it look?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Gorgeous, Sabine. As always.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'sighs\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': The whole thing was a setup.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': You think Vizago was in on it?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d sell his mother to Jawas for a couple credits. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a source of income for him. Even odds he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. The kid did all right.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': He did okay. Where is he?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I, uh, thought he was with you.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Zeb, what did you do to him?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything to him. But that I.S.B. agent grabbed him.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'All\\'\\'\\': What?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': The kid got grabbed, okay?!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Garazeb Orrelios!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Oh, come on! We were dumping him after the mission anyway. This saves us fuel. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go easy on him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a kid.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': I am Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau. And you are?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Jabba the Hutt. Look, I just met those guys today. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anything.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not here for what you know, \"Jabba.\" You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here to be used as bait upon our return to Lothal.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Bait? You seriously think Wow. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re about as bright as a binary droid. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not gonna come for me. People don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'inhales\\'\\'] [\\'\\'exhales\\'\\'] Search him. Then secure him here.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Hey, get off me! Let go! \"You need to go warn them, Ezra.\" What was I thinking? [\\'\\'grunting\\'\\'] And of course, the only thing I manage to hold on to is this worthless piece of [\\'\\'grunts\\'\\'] [\\'\\'clicks\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi (Holograph) \\'\\'\\': This is Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. I regret to report that both our Jedi Order and the Republic have fallen, with the dark shadow of the Empire rising to take their place. This message is a warning and a reminder for any surviving Jedi: Trust in the Force.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': No. No, no. No way! You cannot be serious!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our fault he was there.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Come on, Hera! We just met this kid. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going back for him!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be waiting for us. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t save him.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'grumbling in droid language\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': What? What did he say?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': He voted with me. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two against two. Kanan, you have the deciding vote.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': And you bucketheads are gonna be sorry when my uncle, the Emperor, finds out you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re keeping me here against my will. I guarantee he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make a personal [\\'\\'coughs\\'\\'] example [\\'\\'coughs, chokes\\'\\'] Bye, guys.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': The delay was insignificant. The transport ship Agent Kallus diverted will dock on Kessel within two hours. The Wookiees will be off-loaded to work spice mine K-77.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man #2\\'\\'\\': This is stormtrooper LS-005 reporting to Agent Kallus.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Kallus here.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': Sir, th-the prisoner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': What? I knew the boy would act as bait, but I never dreamed the rebels would be foolish enough to attack a Destroyer. How did they get aboard?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Man\\'\\'\\': Sir, the rebels didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t free him. He, uh--\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Imperial Officer\\'\\'\\': Agent Kallus. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a security breach in the lower hanger.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how, but the rebel ship approached without alerting our sensors.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': They came back! Oh! Ow! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Order all stormtroopers to converse on the lower hangar. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll meet them there.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'clears throat\\'\\'] This is trooper LS-123 reporting intruders in the upper hangar. Sir, I believe the lower hangar is a diversion.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Maybe, maybe not. Squads five through eight divert to upper hangar. The rest converge as ordered.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, every little bit helps.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Find Ezra. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be ready.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Hold this bay till we get back.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': And this time, try not to leave until everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back aboard.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': That was not my fault!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debatable. First you ditch me, then you hit me?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': How was I supposed to know it was you? You were wearing a bucket!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Spectre-1 to Ghost, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Oh, no. This time you board first!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Ghost, raise the ramp.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Aim for shield generator and engines. Do not let them-- [\\'\\'sniffs\\'\\'] Take cover! [\\'\\'grunts\\'\\'] Turn on the shield!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'sighs\\'\\'] Welcome aboard\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 again.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Thanks. Thank you. I really didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come back for me.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get you home now. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure your parents must be worried sick.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have parents. And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got somewhere else to be. I know where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really taking the Wookies. Have you heard of the spice mines of Kessel?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Slaves sent there last a few months, maybe a year.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': And for Wookies, born in the forest, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a death sentence.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Then I guess we better go save \\xe2\\x80\\x98em.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': \"We\"?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Come this far. Might as well finish the job.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Setting course for Kessel.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': One of the rebels was using this helmet. The transmitter was on.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Wookies\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'low grunting\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kitwarr\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'whimpers\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Wookie\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'grunts\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Keep moving!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Wookie\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'growls\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wanna carry your body out.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Wookies\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'grunting\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Wookie\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'growls\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Hey, hey. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here to help!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'screams\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'gasps\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hit! Chopper, aft gun!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': Take them down!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Wookie\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'roars\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kitwarr\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'whimpers\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be okay. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got him.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t maintain position!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Go! Lead the TIEs away and give yourself maneuvering room!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I am not leaving you behind!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running a 22-Pickup.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Seriously?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': You have a better option? Jump into the pit and get it over with?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': All right, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be back. Make sure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': 22-Pickup. Care to let me in on the secret?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Kid, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m about to let everyone in in the secret.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Whoa.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Wookies\\'\\'\\': [growling]\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': All troopers, focus your fire on-- on the jedi.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Time to go!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Right. Everyone, into the container!\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Wookie\\'\\'\\': [\\'\\'roaring\\'\\']\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Kid, stop! Karablast.

A master and an apprentice. Such a rare find these days.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where you get your delusions, buckethead. I work alone.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not this time.

He passed the test.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the force?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': The force is everywhere. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strong with you, Ezra. Otherwise, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never been able top open the Holocron.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': So, what do you want?\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': To offer you a choice. You can keep the lightsaber you stole, let it become just another dusty souvenir. Or you can give it back and come with us, come with me and be trained in the ways of the Force. You can learn what it truly means to be a Jedi.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I thought the Empire wiped out all the Jedi.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': Not all of us.\\n<br />\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': This is Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. I regret to report that both our Jedi Order and the Republic have fallen, with the dark shadow of the Empire rising to take their place.

I can\\'t get a shot if you keep running from them.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Use the rear cannon.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': There is no rear cannon!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Hey, I\\'m doing the best I can!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I can\\'t see!

You\\'re gonna get me fried!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': How\\'d it go?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': It didn\\'t.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Fulcrum\\'\\'\\': Kanan knew the risks, accepted them. I\\'m sorry, but you must focus on your next objective.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': But, Fulcrum, Kanan is our objective. We can still find him.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Fulcrum\\'\\'\\': At what cost? You? Your unit? The overall mission? There\\'s something else, Hera. The transmission Ezra was able to beam out has attracted attention, not just from civilians, but from the highest levels of the Empire.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': It was Kanan\\'s plan. I guess it worked.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Fulcrum\\'\\'\\': Your mission was to be unseen, unnoticed, and now -\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Kanan wanted to inspire people. He wanted to give them hope.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Fulcrum\\'\\'\\': Well, he was successful. But if you are caught, if Ezra is caught, that hope will die. To protect your unit, to protect Ezra, you must stop your search for Kanan and go into hiding.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Odds are they\\'ve still got him at the Imperial Complex.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': If they do, we all know he\\'s as good as gone.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': He\\'s not gone. And he\\'s not in the Imperial Complex.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': How do you know that?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I just know.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': We can\\'t make a plan based on a feeling.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Yes, we can. We do it all the time!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Not this time.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What are you talking about?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We can\\'t go after Kanan. The Empire will be waiting with a trap.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': When has that ever stopped us?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': We can\\'t risk it.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Can\\'t, or won\\'t?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Ezra, there\\'s a bigger mission you\\'re not seeing. It can\\'t be jeopardized for one soldier.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': \"Soldier\"? He\\'s our friend, Hera. I can\\'t just forget him. And I can\\'t believe you would either. He\\'d do whatever it took to protect us.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': He already did when he sacrificed himself. Ezra, he\\'d want us to honor the choice he made.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Hey. Hey, hey, hey, it\\'s okay. I miss him too. But I have a plan to find him. Wanna help?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Why prepare to fight if we\\'re not even going after Kanan?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': You think he\\'ll talk, tell \\'em what he knows about us?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': He doesn\\'t know anything.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Sabine. Uh, where are the power cells? I need some for my lightsaber.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Did you check the overheads?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': First place I looked.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Hold on. I know where to find some. Chopper, take over for me. You can help us look too, Zeb.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Pfft. Really? Why do I need to -\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Just recalibrate the targeting computer, will you?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Is Chopper in position?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Yep. Let me in there.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Wait, you\\'re going to find Kanan. You\\'re disobeying Hera\\'s orders!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Were they orders, or more like her opinion?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': If we\\'re gonna save him, we don\\'t have a choice. You with us or not?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Yeah, I\\'m with you.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Good, because the plan\\'s in motion already. Just waiting for the signal.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Chopper! I said the targeting computer. You\\'re overloading the internal comm! No! Don\\'t turn it up!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Okay. So, where are we going anyway?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Our last resort.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Will you just unplug? How is that my fault? You plugged into the wrong system! Why don\\'t you just go help Ezra find his power cells? Hmm. What are you up to?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Agent Kallus\\'\\'\\': It\\'s only a matter of time before he breaks.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Governor Tarkin\\'\\'\\': You have wasted enough of my time.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': You are no doubt unaware that Jedi are trained to resist mind probes.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Governor Tarkin\\'\\'\\': If he is the Jedi he claims to be, I take it you have a solution?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Pain. A Jedi still feels pain. And pain can break anyone. You will tell me where to find your rebel friends.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': No. Ezra. Not him. Not him.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': What do you see?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I see -\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Go on.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Kanan\\'\\'\\': I see you growing more and more frustrated.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Perceptive. Perhaps you can help alleviate my frustration.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Well, this is unexpected. Looking for work? Or something else?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': My guess is you already know why we\\'re here.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t know where your friend is. I\\'m sorry.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': You must have heard something.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Even if I did know something, it would be of no use to you. The Empire is locking everything down. That\\'s bad for you and bad for business.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, if you want to change that, you need to help us.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': I doubt that. In fact, I think your activities got the Empire\\'s attention and have made things more difficult for me. Get out of here. You\\'re bad luck.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Ever wonder why the Empire was so interested in Kanan, why they\\'d send an Inquisitor to Lothal?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Ezra, don\\'t.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': No, please do.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Because Kanan is a Jedi.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Kanan? A Jedi? You\\'re funny, kid. That scoundrel couldn\\'t be a Jedi any more than you could. You? You are a Jedi?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': And so is Kanan.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': So what does this mean for Vizago?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': It means you help me, and you\\'ll have a Jedi owing you a favor.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Hmm. Whatever I ask?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Within reason.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': No deal.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Okay, okay, okay. Whatever you ask.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': All right, come with me, boy. Alone.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': So start talkin\\'.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': First, the deal. Hey! What\\'s the matter with you? I bow, you bow, then we have deal.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Oh, right. Yes, okay.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Okay, okay, whatever. You\\'re overdoing it. Eh, look, since you blew up the Empire\\'s comm tower -\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': That wasn\\'t us.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Well, you probably know they have no long-range communications, so they\\'ve started using these. Droid couriers. They take data from the city up to their communications ship in orbit.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': What kind of data?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Everything. You name it personnel, weapons, deployments, prisoners.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Kanan?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Possibly, but I can\\'t guarantee that.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': That\\'s pretty typical for you.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Hey, a deal is a deal.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': A deal is a deal. So what do you need?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Vizago\\'\\'\\': Hmm. Today, nothing. Tomorrow, who knows? I\\'ll let you know when I want to collect.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': It\\'s okay, guys. I have a lead. Whoa!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': For what you just bargained, you better have something more than just a lead.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Hera, I know you\\'re mad, but -\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Mad? Try furious. You just put all our lives in jeopardy. I give you a direct order, and you disobeyed me.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Well, it paid off. I know how to find out where Kanan is. Maybe.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Maybe? All that for \"maybe\"?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': Uh-oh.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Hera, none of us want to give up on Kanan.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': And you think I do?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': No, I don\\'t. That\\'s why I took this risk.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Okay. What did you learn?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I have a plan, and it involves Chopper.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I\\'m betting that\\'s the shuttle the Empire\\'s using to get the courier droid to their comm ship. Our only chance is to intercept the droid before it boards the shuttle.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': The only way to be sure is to grab the Imperial droid and send Chopper in its place.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Come on, Chop. I\\'ll give you a paint job. The Empire won\\'t know the difference.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': For Kanan.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Governor Tarkin\\'\\'\\': The Jedi is no good to me dead.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': His resistance is impressive.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Governor Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Yes. He does possess the will of a Jedi of old.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Inquisitor\\'\\'\\': Is it possible he does not know of any other rebels to speak of?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Governor Tarkin\\'\\'\\': Perhaps. I recommend we transfer him from Lothal to another location. One that never fails to extract a confession.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Behind you!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper\\'\\'\\': Ha, I\\'m not gonna fall for -\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Ah.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': I know you can do this, Chopper.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper #1\\'\\'\\': There\\'s the courier. Where\\'s his escort?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper #2\\'\\'\\': Not our problem. We\\'re running late as it is.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Stormtrooper #1\\'\\'\\': BN-749 to pilot. Courier is aboard.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Imperial Pilot\\'\\'\\': Shuttle Lagos requesting permission to dock.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Imperial Deck Officer\\'\\'\\': Lagos, you are clear to proceed.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': Calm down, little guy. We\\'re not gonna hurt you.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Do you have a lock on Chopper\\'s beacon?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Looks like he\\'s aboard the cruiser.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Come on, Chop, find Kanan.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Imperial Crewmember\\'\\'\\': You\\'re late, 264. Plug in. Where\\'s the data? I\\'m not seeing it on my monitor. Hold it. You\\'re not authorized to copy communication logs.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Imperial Deck Officer\\'\\'\\': What\\'s the problem here?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Imperial Crewmember\\'\\'\\': This droid is malfunctioning, sir.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': There\\'s the signal.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': He must have found something.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Positions, everyone! We\\'re going in.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': What about this guy?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Take him with you.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Why me?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': Because you\\'re intimidating.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Can\\'t argue with that. Come on, you.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Imperial Deck Officer\\'\\'\\': Mmm, looks like an older model. You better check its encryption codes. We\\'re under attack!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Gonna make another pass. Chopper better hurry. Zeb, I need some help! Keep their cannons busy!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Ah! Karabast! I\\'m the one who needs some help. Hey, I\\'m starting to like you much better than our regular droid.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I see him. Give me cover, Ezra. Okay, Chopper, hit it!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': That was amazing, Chopper!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Zeb\\'\\'\\': Not bad, not bad. He was actually a big help around here while you were off spying. I say we keep him. I should\\'ve seen that coming.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': I\\'m proud of you. You stepped up and took the lead. Kanan has taught you well.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ezra\\'\\'\\': So have you.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': I think we found something. Kanan is on Governor Tarkin\\'s Destroyer, the Sovereign. It\\'s still here above Lothal, but it\\'s scheduled to leave soon.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hera\\'\\'\\': Where to?\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Sabine\\'\\'\\': The Mustafar system? I\\'ve never heard of it.

That\\'ll make us the Empire\\'s primary target.\\n Yeah, but the Ghost is smaller and faster, so, with any luck, we\\'ll just slip right by.\\n You actually believe that? It makes me feel better when I say it.\\n Besides, we gotta feed those people.\\n Now are you in? You\\'re lucky to have her as your pilot.\\n How many times have you flown it? Me? Oh, I don\\'t fly.\\n Too dangerous.\\n But theoretically, it should fly.\\n Theoretically? Better to be down here wishing I was up there than up there crashing back down here.\\n If that ship crashes, I\\'ll toss you over the side, and see how well you fly! Hera! - Yes! - Yes! Let\\'s see what this beast can do.\\n Definitely not a freighter.\\n That\\'s it.\\n Masterful.\\n Commencing weapons test.\\n I was kind of hoping your ship packed more of a punch, Quarrie.\\n Did you pull the big lever on the right? - No.\\n - Try again.\\n Yay, I told you.\\n Your ship certainly has the firepower we need, but the targeting system could use some work.\\n I\\'ve got some ideas.\\n No, no.\\n That\\'s my ship, young one.\\n Just what do you think you\\'re doing? Never get between a Mandalorian and a weapons package.\\n It\\'s Kanan.\\n He\\'ll want to hear about our success.\\n It has the speed, maneuverability and weaponry.\\n This ship is exactly what the rebellion needs.\\n - That\\'s great news, Hera.\\n - Kanan, they\\'re starting.\\n What\\'s going on? The Ibaarians contacted us.\\n They\\'re at their breaking point.\\n We can\\'t wait any longer.\\n Sato\\'s ordered the second attack on the blockade.\\n We need to get moving.\\n The second attack is about to commence.\\n Well, we\\'ve got a problem.\\n The energy drain from the multi-cannon firing system killed the hyperdrive.\\n In Basic, please.\\n The weapons work, but we\\'ve got no lightspeed.\\n Well, that has been a problem.\\n It\\'s been a problem? You You mean you knew about this? What did you expect for a prototype? There are all sorts of adjustments that need to be made.\\n For instance, I don\\'t even like this paint job so much Come here, fish face.\\n - I want to see if you can fly.\\n - What the Hang on.\\n Hang on, Zeb.\\n Easy.\\n There must be a way to solve this.\\n Oh, it\\'s a shame I had BeeGee install that other hyperdrive on the Phantom.\\n You what? I don\\'t like seeing a ship that can\\'t fly.\\n During the repairs, I upgraded it, because if you don\\'t have a hyperdrive, you can\\'t fly far.\\n You beautiful, crazy Mon Calamari! That\\'s the answer to our problem.\\n What? What\\'s the answer? Sir, enemy ships are approaching from sector nine.\\n Scan the rebel ships.\\n The one which carries the relief supplies will be our primary target.\\n Initiating scan now, sir.\\n Command ship, I\\'ll follow your lead.\\n Hopefully we can break through their line and make a run for the surface.\\n Whose idea was this again? Sir, comscan has identified the Corellian VCX as the supply transport.\\n Of course.\\n Commander, focus all fire on the Ghost.\\n Fighter incoming.\\n Rex, keep those TIEs off our back! Workin\\' on it! Better pick up the pace.\\n The cruisers are closing the gap! We\\'re cut off! I\\'m gonna swing around and try from another direction.\\n Stay on course, Ghost.\\n I\\'ll knock that cruiser out of your way.\\n Turn me loose, Phantom.\\n Say hello to Kallus for me.\\n Oh, we will.\\n If there\\'s anything left of him.\\n Sir, rebel reinforcements have arrived.\\n One shuttle and one ship of unknown design.\\n I would hardly call that reinforcements.\\n You boys better give me some room.\\n You heard the captain.\\n Sabine, we\\'ll get one shot at this.\\n Then it\\'s a good thing you trust me.\\n Sir, the unidentified ship is taking the lead.\\n It\\'s moving into attack position off our starboard side.\\n Steady.\\n Steady! A little closer.\\n Fire! That\\'s impossible.\\n We\\'re clear! Going in.\\n We\\'ll hold off any pursuit once you\\'ve made the jump out.\\n We\\'ll meet you back at the rendezvous.\\n Okay.\\n So, maybe it\\'s not such a hunk of junk after all.\\n We\\'re over the drop zone now.\\n Releasing cargo.\\n We\\'ve recovered the drop.\\n Thank you, Phoenix Squadron.\\n You\\'ve saved us.\\n You\\'ve saved us all.\\n You\\'re welcome.\\n We have confirmation the drop was successful.\\n Let\\'s go home, Phoenix Squadron.\\n It seems Senator Organa has found a ship works sympathetic to our cause, and willing to manufacture more of these B-wings in secret.\\n Project Shantipole will continue under my supervision, of course.\\n There are many adjustments that need be made.\\n Quarrie, thanks to you and your ship, we helped many people today.\\n I just hammered it together, young pilot.\\n You made it soar.\\n Indeed.\\n Your heroics are unparalleled, Captain Syndulla.\\n That is why I agree with Kanan\\'s recommendation.\\n Your recommendation? What have you done now? Just listen to the commander.\\n You are to be promoted to Phoenix Leader.\\n Our fighter pilots will benefit greatly from your expertise.\\n Good job, Captain Hera.\\n[[Category:Star Wars Rebels Transcripts]]'}}, 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars (series)': {'Revival': {'wikicontent': \"\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[Camera pans in, Domino squad, back facing the camera, is in smoke]\\n\\n[Rex begins to give his speech from the Rookies Episode, fade to shot of Rex\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helmet]\\n\\n'''<br>\\n'''\\n* Rex: The name's Rex.

It is imperative that we conquer the capital city as quickly as possible and hold it.\\n\\nAnakin: Our biggest problem is gonna be the local militia.

Let's go. All right! Wipe 'em out! Get them! Ah! Too many of 'em! Whoa! Out of the way! Take it down! Take it down! Take it down!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Go, go, go! Give it to 'em! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Take 'em out! Take 'em all--ah!\\n\\nClone Trooper: That's the stuff.

I recommend we move all platoons off the ridge in case the air strike overshoots.\\n\\nAnakin: Good thinking, Rex. Everyone, move out now!\\n\\nRex: All here, Sir.\\n\\nAnakin: Stay covered. We have to hold the position.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Are you sure those bombers are coming?\\n\\nClone Trooper: Good old Odd Ball, always on target.\\n\\nAnakin: Glad we got off that ridge.\\n\\nRex: Yeah.\\n\\nHardcase: Ha! That'll teach 'em.\\n\\nDogma: General Krell's here?\\n\\nFives: Something big must be going on.\\n\\nAnakin: Master Krell, my thanks for the air support.\\n\\nKrell: Indeed, General Skywalker. The locals have proven to be more resourceful than we anticipated.\\n\\nAnakin: But that's not the reason for your visit.\\n\\nKrell: No. The council has ordered you back to Coruscant, effective immediately.\\n\\nAnakin: What? Wh-why?\\n\\nKrell: I'm afraid a request was made by the Supreme Chancellor, and the Council obliged. That is all they would tell me.\\n\\nAnakin: Well, I can't just leave my men.\\n\\nKrell: I'll be taking over in the interim.\\n\\nRex: Don't worry about a thing, SIr. We'll have this city under Republic control by the time you're back.\\n\\nAnakin: Master Krell, this is Rex, my first in command. You won't find a finer or more loyal trooper anywhere.\\n\\nKrell: Good to hear that. I wish you well, Skywalker.\\n\\nRex: Your reputation precedes you, General. It is an honor to be serving you.\\n\\nKrell: I find it very interesting, Captain, that you are able to recognize the value of honor, for a clone. Stand at attention when I address you. Your flattery is duly noted, but it will not be rewarded. There's a reason my command is so effective. And it's because I do things by the book. And that includes protocol. Have all platoons ready to move out immediately. That is all.\\n\\nRex: Eh...\\n\\nKrell: Quicken that pace, battalion! This isn't some training course on Kamino.\\n\\nFives: The new general has a way with words.\\n\\nRex: He's just trying to keep us on schedule.\\n\\nFives: By raising everyone's ire?\\n\\nRex: Either way, he's in charge and we've got a job to do. Just treat him with respect and we'll all get along fine.\\n\\nFives: Do you see that?\\n\\nRex: Yeah. Ready your weapons.\\n\\nClone Troopers: Ugh! Ah!\\n\\nKrell: Anyone else want to stop and play with the animals? Didn't think so. Now keep moving!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Sir, we've been keeping this pace for 12 hours now. The men are getting worn down. We should rest.\\n\\nRex: General Krell, the top of this ridge will make a good place for the men to make camp.\\n\\nKrell: The men don't need rest. They need the resolve to complete the task at hand.\\n\\nRex: But sir--\\n\\nKrell: CT-7567, are you reading me?\\n\\nRex: Excuse me, Sir?\\n\\nKrell: I asked you a question, CT-7567. Do you understand the need to adhere to my strategy.\\n\\nRex: Sir, the terrain is extremely hostile. Despite the difficulty of the conditions, the battalion is making good time. These men just need a little break.\\n\\nKrell: Captain, do I need to remind you of this battalion's strategic mission in conquering this planet? Look back. See those platoons? Their mission is to take this city and take it swiftly. Time and rest are luxuries the Republic cannot afford. We are the key to this invasion. The other battalions are counting on our support. If we fail, everyone fails. Do you understand this? Do all of you understand this? Now, move on!\\n\\nRex: Sir, we're ready to bring our forward platoons in for a surgical strike on the city's defenses.\\n\\nKrell: There won't be any need, Captain.\\n\\nRex: Sir?\\n\\nKrell: All platoons will execute a forward assault along the main route to the city.\\n\\nRex: But. Sir, General Skywalker's plan was to surprise them with multiple attacks. If we come in from the main route, they're likely to engage us in a full-frontal assault.\\n\\nKrell: Change of plans, Captain. I'm in command now.\\n\\nRex: With all due respect, General, we don't know what we're up against. It might be wiser to think first.\\n\\nKrell: Are you questioning my order? This battalion will take the main road straight to the capital. You will not stop and you will not turn back, regardless of the resistance you meet. We will attack them with all our troops, not some sneak attack with a few men. That is my order, and you will follow it explicitly. Do I make myself clear, CT-7567?\\n\\nRex: Yes, General.\\n\\nKrell: Now, engage.\\n\\nClone Trooper: So, why aren't we sticking to the original plan and probing the city defenses first?\\n\\nHardcase: We can do this. Let's take 'em!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Yeah, leave it to Hardcase to dive in head-first.\\n\\nFives: The general's new plan is reckless.\\n\\nDogma: You ever think that maybe the general knows what he is doing?\\n\\nFives: I know you think this is a bad idea.\\n\\nRex: I raised my objection to General Krell's plan, but he didn't agree. So this is it.\\n\\nFives: Well what if he's wrong? Then what?\\n\\nRex: This isn't the time for a debate. Right now we have to stay alert.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Eh, it's too quiet out there.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Ah! Ah!\\n\\nRex: Mines! Nobody move!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Oz is down.\\n\\nClone Trooper: So is Ringo.\\n\\nRex: Can you sweep 'em?\\n\\nFives: There are more over here. Looks like the whole road's been booby trapped. Everyone watch your step.\\n\\nClone Trooper: We're completely exposed!\\n\\nRex: Hold your ground!\\n\\nHardcase: You want a piece of this?\\n\\nClone Trooper: I think Hardcase made 'em mad.\\n\\nClone Trooper: We're blown!\\n\\nRex: The Umbarans are advancing!\\n\\nHardcase: Make 'em eat heat!\\n\\nUmbaran: Ah!\\n\\nClone Troopers: Ah! Yah! Yah! Ah!\\n\\nDogma: They're coming from all directions.\\n\\nRex: We don't have any cover! We need to pull back. Get them to follow us. If we can draw them out, we can see them. If we can see them, we can hit them. All squads, pull back now!\\n\\nClone Trooper: This can't be good.\\n\\nKrell: Feeble-minded clones. Get in there and save their necks.\\n\\nRex: Get ready! Here they come!\\n\\nRex: Stand fast. Hit 'em with everything you've got.\\n\\nHardcase: Ha, ha, ha! Where you goin'? Get back here!\\n\\nRex: They're falling back!\\n\\nKrell: CT-7567, do you have a malfunction in your design? You pulled your forces back from taking the capital city. The enemy now has control of this route. This entire operation has been compromised because of your failure!\\n\\nFives: General Krell, in case you haven't noticed, Captain Rex just saved this platoon. Surely you won't fail to recognize that.\\n\\nKrell: ARC-5555, stand down.\\n\\nFives: Sir, yes, Sir.\\n\\nRex: Sir, if I may address your accusation; I followed your orders, even in the face of a plan that was in my opinion severely flawed, a plan that cost us men, not clones! Men! As sure as it is my duty to remain loyal to your command, I also have another duty, to protect those men.\\n\\nKrell: You have a spark of tenacity, Captain. I'll give you that. I know that I don't command like the Jedi you're used to serving. Certainly not like General Skywalker. But I have my way. It may be difficult, but these are difficult times. And it's proven effective. I suppose your loyalty to your men is to be commended. They seem to admire this. That's important to an effective commander. All right, Captain Rex, your opinion has been noted. Dismissed.\\n\\nFives: I think he almost complimented you.\\n\\nRex: Uh, it's hard to tell.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Incoming!\\n\\nRex: The Umbarans must've regrouped for a counterattack. Everyone, we must hold this position!\\n\\nFives: You think General Krell still intends on taking the capital using this strategy?\\n\\nRex: I don't know. I'll get back to you on that if we survive this battle.\"}, 'Nightsisters': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'The Jedi Who Knew Too Much': {'wikicontent': '<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\'\\'\\'[incompleted]\\'\\'\\'</p>\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Ghost of Mortis': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Liberty on Ryloth': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Legacy of Terror': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'The Hidden Enemy': {'wikicontent': '*\\'\\'\\'Narrator\\'\\'\\': A planet under siege!

He just sat down and wrote a note?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': You have to start somewhere.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': We appear to have picked up some friends.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Indeed. In fact, I believe the number of eyes watching us has been steadily growing.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': Great. Perhaps this means our adversary has learned about our mission.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Perhaps it does.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': Of course, nobody\\'s tried to stop us yet.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Also true.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': They want us to get to the Separatist headquarters, which means this is a trap.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': I imagine it is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin SKywalker\\'\\'\\': Well, that\\'s unfortunate For them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': R2\\'s found something.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': What is it? Is it the traitor?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Maybe.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': What is he looking for?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Wavelength interference, weak frequencies, spotty, irregular. See, how it shows up every few days then disappears? Day to day, you wouldn\\'t notice it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': What?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': It\\'s the pattern. The band\\'s only coming off one terminal in the whole base. Check it out.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Hmm. Slick\\'s barracks. Only Slick\\'s men would have access to that terminal.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Yeah. Slick\\'s not gonna like that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': No, he\\'s not. But if one of his men is giving away our intel, we have to find him and sort this out.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': No guards, no barricades, you\\'d think the Separatist headquarters would be better protected.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': But clearly, keeping us out is not what they intend.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': No way. My guys are the best. No way they\\'re capable of something like this.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': Something like what?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': You called them here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Of course we did. We\\'re getting to the bottom of this Now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': Look, let me have a few minutes with them first. It\\'s gonna hit them hard. They trust each other, and if one of our own betrayed us I don\\'t think that\\'s necessary.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Your men are tough, right? Take a seat, gentlemen. We have a turncoat in our midst, and we think it\\'s one of you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': So this is the belly of the beast.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Ventress. And here I thought this mission would be unpleasant.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': The pleasure\\'s all mine, my dear Obi-Wan. I\\'ve missed you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jester\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t know, I was doing the things I always do after a mission.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Things like what?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jester\\'\\'\\': I\\'m sorry, sir. I\\'m just a little nervous. You\\'re my C.O.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': The way I figure it, you tell the truth, you got nothing to be nervous about.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Punch\\'\\'\\': Jester is telling the truth. He cleans his weapon after every mission. First thing, every time. He\\'s kind of obsessed that way.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Is that right? You were cleaning your weapon?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jester\\'\\'\\': Yes, sir.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Go on the computer while you were in here?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jester\\'\\'\\': No, sir. I didn\\'t even power it up.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': You can check. Show me your weapon. Yep, freshly scrubbed.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jester\\'\\'\\': The rag\\'s over there in the corner.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Good man. You. You were cleaning your weapon too?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Punch\\'\\'\\': No, I was hungry. I went back to the mess. Right away?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Anyone with you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Punch\\'\\'\\': Sketch, sir.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sketch\\'\\'\\': We got to the mess at the same time, got our grub, and sat together.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Anyone else in the mess able to confirm what you two are saying?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sketch\\'\\'\\': Lots of guys there. Ask any of them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': We will.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': Captain, give me a moment with them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Gus\\'\\'\\': No, it\\'s okay, Sarge. I got nothing to hide. I was in the infirmary. Got banged up pretty good by one of those clankers. A med droid was fixing me up. Doc\\'s got all the records there if you want to check.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': So, Chopper, old boy, what\\'s your alibi?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': I was in the mess hall.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sketch\\'\\'\\': No, you weren\\'t! I mean, you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': If you know something, kid, you should speak up.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Sketch\\'\\'\\': Chopper came in a lot later. After everyone else.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': My loyal informant let me know you were coming.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Well, then, we thank you for your hospitality.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Where were you before you went to the mess, Chopper?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': Nowhere. Walking around.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Son, you know we\\'ll need a better answer than that.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': I was hiding at the south exit. I didn\\'t want anyone to see me string these together.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Battle droid fingers.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': I just I just wanted something back. I guess I felt like they owed me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Gus\\'\\'\\': I always knew there was something deficient about you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': This isn\\'t good, Chopper. Lying about where you were, taking forbidden items from a battlefield.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': I know. I put up with the attitude \\'cause you have skill.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': But if you could break these rules, your whole character\\'s in question here.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': Wait, no! Hang on. I\\'m no spy!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': Chopper, we\\'re all brothers. But how can we trust anything you say now?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': No, sir, I\\'m telling you, I did not--\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': It\\'s okay. We\\'ll get you a proper investigation. You don\\'t have to say anything till the Jedi come back and talk to you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': Maybe you should talk, sir. Tell them where you went. I was at the south exit, remember? I saw you go in go in, sir. I saw you.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': Chopper, I have been patient.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chopper\\'\\'\\': Everyone else turned right toward the barracks and the mess. You turned left, toward the command center. Where were you going, sir?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Obviously, the kid feels cornered. Sergeant, what did you mean, \"Till the Jedi come back\"? How did you know the Jedi were gone? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': I really wish you hadn\\'t noticed that, sir.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': It\\'s Slick? Slick\\'s the traitor?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': I\\'ve got someone by the gunships. That\\'s our Slick. Now that he\\'s exposed, he has to get out of this base. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': There\\'s no escape now, you piece of rankweed! Move. Move!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': He took out our weapons depot.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': He knew where we\\'d look. He\\'s not trying to escape.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': He knows all our moves before we even make them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Give up, Ventress!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': I am all yours, Obi-Wan. You\\'ve served your purpose.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': We have to get back. Now! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': It\\'s already too late. So hard to know whom to trust these days, isn\\'t it? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': What\\'s the plan, Master?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Bringing us here was a mistake, my sweet. You\\'ve overestimated your abilities.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Really?  Come and get me, boys!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': You didn\\'t tell us you were bringing friends.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Poor Obi-Wan. You\\'ve been betrayed. And now we\\'re about to take control of this world.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': How do we get this guy?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Gus\\'\\'\\': Sir. Slick ran into the command center.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': You guys stay here. Seal the perimeter. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Anakin! \\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Prepare to march on the city. Have General Loathesome delay the Jedi as long as possible. I will need time to execute the next part of my Master\\'s plan.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Tactical droid #2\\'\\'\\': Yes, Mistress.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Pretend you\\'re Slick. What\\'s in your head? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': My cover\\'s blown, it\\'s time to go, but I decide not to use a ship because it\\'s too obvious. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': The lockdown.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': He wants to get around the lockdown. He\\'s blinded us by taking out the power. He could disable the entire security system.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Yeah. But he knows we\\'d expect him to do that. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Or does he? Yeah, I see what you\\'re getting at.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Go to the south exit.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': What are you gonna do?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': I\\'ll stay here, get the power back up. That\\'ll help.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Got it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Hey, there, Slick. Gun\\'s empty. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': You know what\\'s funny, traitor? We knew you\\'d never take a chance on the exits while they were blocked.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': I\\'d stay here to open them myself first. Just like you. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Don\\'t do a job till you\\'ve guaranteed the best odds, right?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': You knew I was here. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Of course we knew. You think we wouldn\\'t have a plan? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': I\\'m not the traitor. You are! All of you just blindly following orders, for what? At least I got something out of all this suffering.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': I bet you sold out your brothers for some real shiny coin. Huh?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': Yes, she offered me money. But she offered me something more important. Something you wouldn\\'t understand. Freedom!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': I think freedom\\'s gonna have to wait, kid.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Slick? It was you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': He gave us a bit of a chase, sir. You couldn\\'t be a greater disappointment.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': How could you do this to your brothers? \\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': Only a Jedi would ask that. It\\'s the Jedi who keep my brothers enslaved. We do your bidding. We serve at your whim. I just wanted something more.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': And all you had to do to get it was put the rest of us all at risk. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Slick\\'\\'\\': I love my brothers. You\\'re too blind to see it, but I was striking the blow for all clones.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': If you loved your brothers, you wouldn\\'t have put them at risk. \\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': You betrayed everyone of us.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': Take him to lockup.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': Were you able to salvage anything from the weapons depot?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Captain Rex\\'\\'\\': Slick pretty much scorched the whole thing. That seemed to be what he was going for all along.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Commander Cody\\'\\'\\': We managed to save the heavy cannons, though.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'\\'\\': That\\'s good, \\'cause there are about?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Anakin Skywalker\\'\\'\\': The fight goes on, gentlemen.\\n*\\'\\'\\'[End of The Hidden Enemy]\\'\\'\\'\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, u'Lightsaber Lost': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Landing at Point Rain': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'A Necessary Bond': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Blue Shadow Virus': {'wikicontent': '==Blue Shadow Virus==\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Assassin': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'Slaves of the Republic': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Pursuit of Peace': {'wikicontent': '<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\'\\'\\'[incomplete & blank/empty]\\'\\'\\'</p>\\n{{Stub}}\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, u'Dooku Captured': {'wikicontent': '==Dooku Captured==\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Shadow Warrior': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Crisis on Naboo': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Destiny': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'The Citadel': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Duel of the Droids': {'wikicontent': '{{NotEnoughNotice}}\\n==Duel of the Droids==\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'The Rise of Clovis': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Hostage Crisis': {'wikicontent': 'Episode Air No.\\n: 22 Original Air Date: March 20, 2009 Production No.\\n: Season 2; Episode 4 Hostage Crisis Written by Eoghan Mahony Supervising Writer: Drew Z.\\nGreenberg Staff Writer: Brian Larsen Directed by Giancarlo Volpe \\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\xef\\xbf\\xbd Danger looms!

Of course it's a trap, Skywalker.\\nI will contact you when we find the children.\\nWhat if they don't find those kids? They will, snips.\\nCome on.\\nThe coordinates.\\nThe coordinates are cross 7RB71.\\nThat will take us into the far Outer Rim, neutral space.\\nDo you want your holocron and your kids or not? Anakin, it is good to see you.\\nYour Excellency.\\nExcuse us, child.\\nI understand you made an important arrest in the plot to destroy the Jedi.\\nDo you think a simple bounty hunter could create such a plan? I believe someone else, someone much more powerful was behind this.\\nI don't think it was Dooku.\\nAnd have you any clues as to who it may be? Not yet, chancellor.\\nHave patience, my boy.\\nThere, there, child.\\nSoon you will cry no more.\\nMaster, subjects of this age rarely survive the slave conditioning procedure.\\nAnd I'm afraid the risk is necessary.\\nThe natural talent these children possess is too great to be wasted by the Jedi.\\nI foresee an army of force-talented spies in my service, trained in the dark side to peer into every corner of the galaxy from afar.\\nAnd my enemies would be helpless against such vision.\\nIf the surgery fails, I will have lost nothing.\\nWe'll be fine, Cody.\\n- Stay here and watch the ship.\\n- Yes, sir.\\nI'll keep the ship running.\\nI do not sense any children nearby.\\nNeither do I.\\nWhere are you keeping the children? The children are safe.\\nBut first, there is your precious holocron.\\nLet me get it for you.\\nNo more of your tricks.\\nBlast! You certainly stepped in it this time.\\nSo long, Jedi.\\nNow what do we do? Well, the piloting systems are clean.\\n- Check the landing gear? - Double-checked it.\\nI have the feeling Master Windu and Obi-Wan could've used our help.\\nI don't like being out of the action either, but somebody's got to do this job.\\nAnd it always ends up being us.\\nBane picked up a lot of volcanic ash on his travels.\\nWhat have you got, Artoo? Looks like Bane erased his navigation records, but not his fuel computer.\\nSo? If we cross the list of planets we know he visited with the distance he traveled We may be able to calculate where else he went.\\nThat's a new one.\\nIt's an old Jedi trick we use to track down smugglers.\\nOkay, let's see.\\nGlee Anselm, Rodia, Mustafar, - Naboo.\\n- Wait.\\nMustafar? There were no children on Mustafar.\\nIt's a mining world, very remote.\\nProbably stopped there to refuel.\\nThat explains the ash.\\nBut it was six systems out of his way.\\nMaybe he met up with whoever he's working for.\\nIt's worth a look, isn't it? Anything to get out of this hangar.\\nI've got the holocron.\\nAnytime, Cody.\\nWe're coming up on Mustafar.\\nArtoo, begin the landing cycle.\\nA starship is approaching.\\nIt is not the bounty hunter.\\nThis was unexpected.\\nEvacuate the children to my secondary facility.\\nI'm afraid this installation is lost.\\nWe must destroy all the evidence.\\nTurn off the gravity supports and let the building sink into the lava.\\n- I beg your pardon, sir.\\n- Just do as I say.\\nYou sure this is the right place? We're gonna find out.\\nI sense something, Master, and I don't like it.\\nIt's the dark side, Ahsoka.\\nThis is the right place.\\nDid you hear that? Yeah, I heard it.\\nThe question is, where are they? This way.\\nAll gravity supports off.\\nQuick, the Jedi are coming.\\nTurn out the lights.\\nHurry, hurry.\\nWe're too late.\\nI can sense they're still here.\\nBe careful of the younglings.\\nI know! - The panel's fried.\\n- Where's Artoo? Be quiet.\\nIt's okay.\\nThe base was completely destroyed, Master, and so was any clue who's behind this.\\nMost unfortunate this is.\\nAnd we still have Bane.\\nHe got away again? The important thing is that the children are safe and we've recovered the holocron.\\nThe list is intact, and there is no evidence it was copied.\\nStill, the future of all Jedi uncertain is.\\nMove forward cautiously we must.\\nMay The Team Be With You for La Fabrique\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\"}, 'The Disappeared, Part II': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Nomad Droids': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Altar of Moris': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Tipping Points': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Sacrifice': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Incomplete]]'}, 'Escape from Kadavo': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'The Disappeared, Part I': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Hunt for Ziro': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, u'Storm over Ryloth': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'The Lost One': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Gungan Attack': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Deception (episode)|Deception': {'wikicontent': '\\'\\'\\'Narrator:\\'\\'\\' \\'\\'A terrorist threat!

There is concern you have lost your focus. Lord Sidious demands more dramatic results, more dead Jedi.\\n*'''General Grievous''': You expect victory over Jedi, but all you give me to fight them is battle droids.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': These must be trophies taken from the Jedi he's murdered. There are so many.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Why would Dooku want to set a trap for his best General?\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': Are we the bait, or is Grievous the bait?\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': We must consider who this trap is for.\\n*'''Bel''': General, your droid is tracking an incoming ship.

It's headed our way.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Keep out of sight and stand by for further orders.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': Capturing Grievous could turn the tide of the war.\\n*'''Commander Fil''': And if he doesn't know we're here, we could take him down easy.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Don't underestimate him. We'll need a plan.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Guards? Gore? Gore, where are you?\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Welcome home, General. I'm afraid I must request your surrender. Cooperate, Grievous, and perhaps the Senate will be merciful.\\n*'''General Grievous''': It is you who shall get no mercy.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Cables!\\n*'''Commander Fil''': Don't let him go! We got him.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Don't let him cut the lines!\\n*'''Commander Fil''': Hold him.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': Don't make me destroy you.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Come and get me.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': Cut him off!\\n*'''Commander Fil''': Where'd he go?\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': The clones got in the way. I could have taken him.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Let's take care of our wounded.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Doctor, where are you?\\n*'''EV-A4-D''': Don't be upset with me, master. If you were a better fighter, we would not be having this conversation. Look what you let those Jedi do to you. You're a walking scrap pile. What a mess. It's going to take me forever to get you back into decent shape. I'll go fetch your spare parts.\\n*'''General Grievous''': What happened to my bodyguards?\\n*'''EV-A4-D''': They were remotely deactivated for recharge. I thought you did it.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Lock down the perimeter.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': Let me go after Grievous myself, Master.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Patience, Nahdar. You may no longer be a Padawan, but you are not ready to take on Grievous. It's time we retreated.\\n*'''General Grievous''': You are not going anywhere.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': It looks like we're going to have to fight after all.\\n*'''Commander Fil''': Green scout to watcher base.\\n*'''Bel''': Copy.\\n*'''Commander Fil''': This is watcher base, over. Contact the fleet at Besteene. Inform them we've engaged Grievous and require reinforcements.\\n*'''Bel''': Right away, sir. Better warm up the shuttle's long-range transmitter.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Get out of there, R6, now! R6? R6?\\n*'''General Grievous (Hologram)''': You've run out of time.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Why don't you come out, General? Show us some of that Separatist hospitality.\\n*'''General Grievous (Hologram)''': Patience. In the meantime, please experience all my home has to offer. It has been prepared for uninvited guests like you.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': General, I know you're watching. We've seen the lower levels of your home. We're not impressed.\\n*'''General Grievous''': (Laughs) Good, Jedi, good. You will provide some sport for me yet. Gore, time to entertain our guests.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Stand firm. There might be worse things here than Grievous.\\n*'''Commander Fil''': It looks like you're right about that, sir.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Good-bye, Jedi.\\n*'''Ev-A4-D''': Master, the armor patches are getting cold, and contrary to your belief, I do have other things to do. Proceed with my repair.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Proceed with my repair.\\n*'''EV-A4-D''': Sometimes I wonder why you submitted to the changes.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Improvements. I submit to no one. I chose them. Now get on with it.\\n*'''EV-A4-D''': There may be some discomfort.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': Shoot him, commander! Grievous is going to pay for this. I will destroy him.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': I understand your pain, but you forget your teachings, Nahdar. Revenge is not the Jedi way.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': But in this war, strength prevails. The rules have changed.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Perhaps you are the one who has changed. Come now, we need to keep moving.\\n*'''General Grevious''': Let's see if Gore is finished playing with the Jedi. Huh? Where are they? Gore? \\n*'''EV-A4-D''': Master, you have an incoming transmission from Count Dooku.\\n*'''Count Dooku (Hologram)''': General, I understand the Jedi have infiltrated your lair. Your recent defeats at their hands have shaken my faith in your ability to lead the droid army. I'm sure you can understand my need to reassess your effectiveness.\\n*'''General Grievous''': You! You deactivated my guards. You let the Jedi in here so you would test me.  \\n*'''Count Dooku (Hologram)''': I do hope you emerge victorious.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Ha!\\n*'''Count Dooku''': It's time for you to prove-- (Calls off)\\n*'''General Grievous''': Oops. All right, Count. I'll play your little game.\\n*'''EV-A4-D''': In your condition, you need your rest.\\n*'''General Grievous''': I will rest when the Jedi are dead.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': You were right, Master. That exit must lead to the control room.\\n*'''EV-A4-D''': Oh, what have we here? The uninvited guests.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Let's go.\\n*'''EV-A4-D''': Master, the Jedi are about to enter the control room.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Nahdar, inside, hurry!\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': No, you go. I will hold him off.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': There's no time to argue.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': We can't just run. We must finish him.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Nahdar, hurry! \\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': I have been waiting for this.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Nahdar!\\n*'''General Grievous''': Greetings, young Jedi. Where is your Master? \\n*'''EV-A4-D''': How exciting.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': You will find out soon enough. You can't defeat us all.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Of course I can.\\n*'''EV-A4-D''': Get him, master. Kill him. Wait. Where's the other Jedi? Oh, no.\\n*'''Nahdar Vebb''': No.\\n*'''General Grievous''': I will kill you all. Do you hear me, Jedi?\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': R6? Is that you? Meet me at the south landing platform. I'll be right there.\\n*'''General Grievous''': I'm coming for you next, Fisto.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': I'll be gone by the time you get here. R6, I'm at the platform. Where are you? \\n*'''General Grievous''': Going somewhere? Huh?\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': You might have been a proud warrior once, but now you're just a pawn in Dooku's game. \\n*'''General Grievous''': I wield great power, Jedi fool.\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': That power will only consume you. \\n*'''General Grievous''': How quickly power can change hands. Surrender, and I promise you will die quickly. Stop him!\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': Let's go home, R6.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Count Dooku, the Jedi have been defeated. \\n*'''Count Dooku (Hologram)''': Victory over the clones and the young Jedi was expected, but to best a Jedi Master This is truly an accomplishment worthy of recognition. \\n*'''General Grievous''': The Jedi Fisto escaped.\\n*'''Count Dooku (Hologram)''': So there is room for improvement. (Calls off)\\n*'''Mace Windu''': What about your former Padawan?\\n*'''Kit Fisto''': His heart was in the right place, but he tried to answer Grievous' power with his own.\\n*'''Yoda''': To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not. In this war, a danger there is of losing who we are.\\n*'''[End of Lair of Grievous]'''\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]\"}, u'Senate Murders': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'Plan of Dissent': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Cargo of Doom': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'A Sunny Day in the Void': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Rookies': {'wikicontent': \"*'''Narrator''': As the war escalates in the Outerrim, the Jedi knights are spread thinly across the galaxy. Many new clones are rushed into service to support their Jedi generals. Unfortunately, because of the relentless demands of battle, many young clones must join the struggle before their intensive training has been completed. These clones, manning of a whole network of tracking stations, are all that stands between the Republic and invasion.\\n*'''Sentry''': This is the deck officer checking in. Nothing going on. As usual.\\n*'''Woman''': You're listening to the grand army of the Republic broadcast. The voice of the Outerrim. This next one goes out to the med-jumpers of the 224th. Smugging it out on Membom. Keep your heads down and your seals tight, boys.\\n*'''Hevy''': Yes! Who's next? Fives?\\n*'''Fives''': Shouldn't you watching your scopes, Hevy?\\n*'''Hevy''': Let's take a look. Well, you know? All clear. Just like the last thousand times I looked at it.\\n*'''Echo''': Personally, I like that it's so quiet out here. I can catch up on the rig manuals.\\n*'''Hevy''': Echo, what is wrong with you? We should be out on the front lines, blasting droids.\\n*'''Cutup''': Leave him alone. They kept him in his growh jar too long.\\n*'''Hevy''': Yeah. You may not realize it yet, Fives, but you landed on the most boring post in the Outerrim.\\n*'''Droidbait''': And one of the most important.\\n*'''Cutup''': Attention! Sergeant on deck!\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': At ease! Even though you're all new here, I shouldn't have to remind you that this quadrant is key to the Outerrim. If the droids get past this station, they can surprise-attack the facilities where we were born on our home world of Kamino. There are some officers on the way, so I want everything squared away for inspection. Understood?\\n*'''Clone Troopers''': Sir, yes, sir!\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': Still here, Anakin.\\n*'''Anakin Skywalker''': When was the last time you slept? I'll sleep after we find general Grievous. Clone intelligence spotted him in the Balmorra system. That was weeks ago. Since then, he vanished.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': Well, unlike you, maybe he's getting some much-need rest.\\n*'''Wullf Yularen''': Excuse me, general. Incoming transmission from commander Cody.\\n*'''Commander Cody (Hologram)''': General Kenobi, General Skywalker.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': Cody. How goes the inspections?\\n*'''Commander Cody (Hologram)''': The tracking station in Pastil is fully operational. Captain Rex and I are proceeding to the outpost in the Rishi system.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': Good. Report back once you've arrived.\\n*'''Commander Cody (Hologram)''': Copy that. Cody out. (Calls off)\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': Good man, that Cody. Don't worry, Anakin. If general Grievous comes anywhere near this quadrant, we'll know about it.\\n*'''Sentry''': Sir, incoming meteor shower.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': Raise the shield.\\n*'''Cutup''': You wanted excitement, Hevy.\\n*'''Echo''': Right. Meteor shower.\\n*'''Clone Trooper''': What the--\\n*'''Commando Droid''': Get these doors open.\\n*'''Commando Droids''': Roger, roger.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': CT-327, report in. Sentry, do you copy?\\n*'''Clone Trooper''': Interference from the meteors?\\n*'''Hevy''': I don't see him down there, sarge. You two, go find him.\\n*'''Clone Trooper''': Droids!\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': Sound the alarm!\\n*'''Hevy''': They've disabled the beacon.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': Get a message to the fleet! We have to warn--\\n*'''Hevy''': Sarge!\\n*'''Echo''': That should slow those buckets down.\\n*'''Hevy''': This way. Hurry!\\n*'''Cutup''': No, we can--\\n*'''Hevy''': There's too many.\\n*'''Commando Droid (Hologram)''': The outpost is secure, general. We shut down the alarm and turned on the all-clear signal.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Excellent. Keep that signal alive. I don't want the Republic to find out we're coming.\\n*'''Battle Droid''': General, our spy on Kamino is making contact.\\n*'''Asajj Ventress (Hologram)''': All the preparations for your invasion are in order.\\n*'''General Grievous''': Good. Our fleet is approaching the system. We are almost at the rendezvous point.\\n*'''Asajj Ventress''': Very good, my Lord. I will await your arrival.\\n*'''General Grievous''': The destruction of Kamino will stop their production of clones for good.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Rishi outpost, this is commander Cody. Do you copy? Rishi outpost, please respond.\\n*'''Commando Droid''': Open, open Open comlink channel.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Rishi outpost, come in. Rishi outpost, come in.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': Sorry, commander. We're, experiencing technical difficulties.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': This is the inspection team.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': Inspection? Negative, negative. We, do not require an inspection. Everything is fine here. Thank you.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': We'll be the judge of that. Prepare for our arrival.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': Roger, roger.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Something's not right here.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Well, good luck. I'm putting you in charge of this one.\\n*'''Fives''': What do we do without the sarge?\\n*'''Sentry''': The reg manual says the next--\\n*'''Hevy''': Wait. Wait. Did you hear that?\\n*'''Echo''': Yeah, what is that? It doesn't sound like droids.\\n*'''Hevy''': Don't forget about those giant eels.\\n*'''Echo''': I've never seen-- Cutup! What the hell was that?\\n*'''Sentry''': That was an eel. Now, that's why we have the regulation not to go outside.\\n*'''Echo''': Let's move before it comes back.\\n*'''Sentry''': Poor Cutup.\\n*'''Echo''': Look! It's commander Cody. It's the inspection team.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': This is not good. I don't see the deck officer anywhere.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': These boys are sloppy. There should always be an officer on duty.\\n*'''Echo''': We have to warn them. Get on the comlink.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': I have a bad feeling about this.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': Welcome to Rishi, Commander. As you can see, the outpost is operating at peak efficiency. Thank you for visiting, and have a safe trip back.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': We need to inspect the base just the same.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': There is no need. Everything is fine and fully operational.\\n*'''Sentry''': It's no good. Their comlinks are on a different scramble set.\\n*'''Hevy''': I'll signal them with this flare.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Take us to the Sergeant in command.\\n*'''Sergeant O'Niner''': Roger, roger.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': A droid attack flare? Rex! What the heck are you doing?\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Relax. Just as I thought. Looks like one of those new commando droids.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': That flare must have come from the survivors.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Ambush!\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Those clankers have tough armor.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': We're cut off. Off the platform!\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Copy that.\\n*'''Commando Droid''': No sign of them. They must have been pulverized. Resume defensive posts.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Well, that sure complicates things, commander. No worse than that time on Tibrin. We had Jedi with us on Tibrin.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': They helped.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Hands above your head. Take your sun bonnets off.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Sir?\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Take 'em off! Now!\\n*'''Echo''': Nice shot.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': The name's Rex. But you'll call me Captain or sir.\\n*'''Clone Troopers''': Sir, yes, sir!\\n*'''Commander Cody''': I'm Commander Cody, your new boss.\\n*'''Fives''': My designation is trooper 27-5555, sir.\\n*'''Hevy''': We call him Fives. I'm Hevy. This is Echo.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Where's your Sergeant?\\n*'''Echo''': Dead, sir. We're all that's left.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Looks like we got ourselves a batch of shinies, Commander.\\n*'''Echo''': Shinies, sir?\\n*'''Captain Rex''': That's right. Your armor, it's shiny and new, just like you.\\n*'''Sentry''': Sir, me and my batchers are trained and ready. We'll take back our post, shiny or not.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': There's hope for you yet, rookie.\\n*'''Wullf Yularen''': Commander Cody, do you copy? Captain Rex, please respond.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': They should have checked in from the Rishi station hours ago. It appears your captain follows orders as well as you do.\\n*'''Anakin Skywalker''': Perhaps Cody is boring Rex with standard procedures and protocol.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': We need to work on our own boring procedures and figure out a strategy to find Grievous.\\n*'''Anakin Skywalker''': Right. Admiral, let me know if you hear from Rex.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Look sharp, rookies. As long as those tweezers occupy this post, our home planet of Kamino is at risk.\\n*'''Sentry''': But there's so many of them.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Doesn't matter, kid. We have to retake this base, so we will retake this base.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': How do you propose we get through those blast doors, Rex, old boy?\\n*'''Captain Rex''': I have a few ideas.\\n*'''Comamndo Droid''': What is that? Unit 2-6, is that you?\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Roger, roger.\\n*'''Commando Droid''': You sound strange. Is something wrong with your vocabulator?\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Roger, roger.\\n*'''Commando Droid''': Take off your helmet. Let me see your faceplate.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Roger, roger.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': This is never gonna work.\\n*'''Commando Droid''': Clones!\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Roger, roger. Right. Let's move.\\n*'''Echo''': Permission to take point, sir?\\n*'''Captain Rex''': I'm always first, kid.\\n*'''Echo''': Fives!\\n*'''Commander Cody''': He's okay. Focus on the battle.\\n*'''Echo''': I got one!\\n*'''Sentry''': Sorry, Echo. I jumped that one.\\n*'''Echo''': Like hell you did.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Get to the window. It looks like we have more visitors.\\n*'''Echo''': It looks like a Separatist fleet.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': That's why they commandeered the outpost. They're mounting a full-scale invasion.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': We have to warn command.\\n*'''Battle Droid''': The Republic base is still transmitting the all-clear signal, but for some reason, our commando droids are not responding.\\n*'''General Grievous''': That base cannot be allowed to alert the Jedi that we're coming. Send down reinforcements to investigate.\\n*'''Hevy''': Those clankers sabotaged our transmitter, and hard-wired the all-clear signal. It'll take time to repair.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': We don't have time. Look.\\n*'''Fives''': Well, buddy, you always said you wanted to be on the front lines.\\n*'''Hevy''': We can't protect the outpost long against that army of clankers.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Then we'll destroy the outpost instead.\\n*'''Hevy''': But, sir, our mission is to defend this facility at all costs.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': We have to warn the Republic about the invasion. They'll take notice when the all-clear signal stops.\\n*'''Fives''': That's right. When they stop receiving our beacon, they'll get the message something's wrong.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': We'll need every thermal detonator in the inventory.\\n*'''Fives''': It'll take more than a few detonators to destroy this outpost.\\n*'''Echo''': We can use the LT. This moon freezes for over half the year. We use Liquid Tibanna as fuel to heat the base.\\n*'''Fives''': Liquid Tibanna: highly explosive.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Good. Bring the tanks here and prime the detonators. All right, listen up. There's only one target of interest in this sector: Kamino. It's the closest thing we clones have to a home. Today we fight for more than the Republic. Today we fight for all our brothers back home. Understood?\\n*'''Clone Troopers''': Sir, yes, sir!\\n*'''Hevy''': I think we can even the odds a bit, Commander, especially since they don't know we're here. This one here is mine. Big gun doesn't make a big man.\\n*'''Battle Droid''': Reinforcements reporting. Open up.\\n*'''Hevy''': Didn't say please.\\n*'''Battle Droid''': Clones! Get 'em!\\n*'''Hevy''': We could use a Jedi about now.\\n*'''Wullf Yularen''': Captain Rex, come in. Commander Cody, are you there? General, there's still no response.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': How about the all-clear signal? Is the base still transmitting?\\n*'''Wullf Yularen''': Yes, sir.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': If something were wrong, Cody would contact us.\\n*'''General Grevious''': What is the status of the base?\\n*'''Battle Droid''': We've run into some difficulties. There seem to be a few clones left, sir.\\n*'''General Grevious''': Then wipe them out. We can't let a few puny clones stop us.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Fall back to the op center. Move! Rex, time's wasting.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Almost ready. The handset isn't linked up with the detonator. Hevy.\\n*'''Hevy''': Yes, sir.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': This detonator isn't working.\\n*'''Hevy''': I'll take care of it. It'll be fixed in no time. You guys get out of here.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Just make it fast. Those droids are getting close.\\n*'''Hevy''': There. That should fix it. This isn't good. There's got to be another way.\\n*'''Battle Droid''': The base is ours again, sir. The clones are fleeing.\\n*'''Battle Droid Commander''': Cowards. Secure the area.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Hevy, hit the-- Where's Hevy?\\n*'''Hevy''': I'm on it, sir.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Hevy, get out of there.\\n*'''Hevy''': The remote isn't working. I have to detonate it manually.\\n*'''Battle Droid''': Hold on there. Blast him!\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Hevy.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': We've got to get up there. Back to the maintenance pipe.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Let's move.\\n*'''Hevy''': It's no use. I know what I have to do.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': I don't like your tone, rookie. Soldier, come in. Are you there? Soldier, come in! Respond!\\n*'''Commander Cody''': Hevy, come in. Come in, Hevy!\\n*'''Battle Droid''': Do we take prisoners?\\n*'''Hevy''': I don't.\\n*'''Echo''': Hevy always did hate that place.\\n*'''Wullf Yularen''': The all-clear signal has been disabled? The Rishi base has stopped transmitting.\\n*'''Anakin Skywalker''': Grievous.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': Sound the invasion alarm. Let's get the fleet under way.\\n*'''General Grievous''': I didn't tell them to blow up the station.\\n*'''Battle Droid''': But isn't it good that the base is destroyed?\\n*'''General Grievous''': Idiot! The Republic fleet. We're outgunned. Get us out of here.\\n*'''Fives''': We've got those tinnies on the run. Thanks to Hevy. Gunships.\\n*'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''': On behalf of the Republic, we thank you for your valiant service, and we honor your comrade's sacrifice.\\n*'''Anakin Skywalker''': Your new unit is lucky to have you. I'd be proud to fight beside you anytime, anywhere.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': Congratulations. You're not shinies anymore.\\n*'''Echo''': With all due respect, sir, we failed our mission. We don't deserve this honor.\\n*'''Commander Cody''': No, if it weren't for you, the Republic wouldn't have learned of the Separatists' invasion until it was too late.\\n*'''Captain Rex''': You showed me something today. You're exactly the kind of men I need in the 501st.\\n*'''Echo and Fives''': Sir, yes, sir!\\n*'''[End of Rookies]'''\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]\"}, u'Downfall of a Droid': {'wikicontent': '==Downfall of a Droid==\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Fugitive': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Jedi Crash': {'wikicontent': '==Jedi Crash==\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Overlords': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Missing in Action': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Corruption': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, u'Cat and Mouse': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'Brothers': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Water War': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'ARC Troopers': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'Mercy Mission': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Bound of Rescue': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Cloak of Darkness': {'wikicontent': '==Cloak of Darkness==\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'A Friend in Needed': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'The Zillo Beast Strikes Back': {'wikicontent': '{{DEFAULTSORT:Zillo Beast Strikes Back, The}}\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, u'R2 Come Home': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'The Gathering': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Ambush': {'wikicontent': '*\\'\\'\\'Narrator\\'\\'\\': Great leaders inspire greatness in others.

The enemy will fire at anything we launch.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Then launch all of them, you will.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Count Dooku (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Master Yoda\\'s powers have been greatly exaggerated.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': That remains to be seen Count.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Count Dooku (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Indeed But when you decide to join us, my apprentice will contact me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander\\'\\'\\': Hang on, almost What a terrible shot.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid\\'\\'\\': Ah well, It\\'s my programming.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rys\\'\\'\\': That was a close one.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': General, I think we\\'re out of range.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': I agree, But, entering another trap we are.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rys\\'\\'\\': Are you sure?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': A disturbance in the force, there is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': My Lord, Master Yoda\\'s warship has fled the system. What further evidence do you require of the Jedi\\'s weakness?\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': This is King Katuunko. Speak.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': Master Yoda would like to talk with you sir.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': A pleasure it is, to hear your voice, your heighness. Master Yoda, of the Jedi Council this is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': Master Jedi, I though perhaps Count Dooku had, frightened you off.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Delayed have I been, but not too far away am I now. Unaware I was, Count Dooku was invited to our meeting.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': The Count invited himself. He assures me that in this time of war, his droids can offer me greater security than your Jedi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Hmmm, a matter of debate that is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Your Majesty might prefer more than words.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katunnko\\'\\'\\': What do you have in mind?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': If Yoda is indeed the Jedi warrior you believe he is, let him prove it. Allow me to send my best troops to capture him. If he escapes, join the Republic. But should my droids defeat Yoda, consider an alliance with the Seperatists.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katunnko\\'\\'\\': I did not request Yoda\\'s presence here to test him in battle.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Accept the challenge I do, your heighness. Arrive by nightfall, I will. (Calls off)\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katunnko\\'\\'\\': Master Yoda must be given a fair fight.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': My dear King Katuunko, I would have it no other way.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Beautiful this moon is. Amazing the universe is.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rys\\'\\'\\': There\\'s gotta be a full battalion in there. Probably packin\\' armor too.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': We\\'ll have somethin\\' for \\'em.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': I\\'m deploying my forces, master.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Count Dooku (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Yoda has made a grave mistake, straying this far from Coruscant.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': I will see the Jedi gets his \"fair\" fight.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Carry only what you need, slow you down it will. Destroy Ventress, your weapons will not. Come lieutenant. Hurry we must.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': Sir, the rendezvous point is that way.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': As is our enemy. To reach our goal, a straight path we will not follow.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': Let\\'s move it boys.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Find Master Yoda.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid\\'\\'\\': Ahh, what does he look like?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': He\\'ll be the small shriveled green one, with the light saber.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid\\'\\'\\': Small huh? Don\\'t worry Supreme Leader, we\\'ll take care of him.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander\\'\\'\\': I think I see them. They\\'re hiding deep in the trees. Fire on Sector 11.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': At ease be, my friends, within range we are not.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander\\'\\'\\': Hold it, Hold it. I said hold it! That\\'s far enough! I mean it! Stop I said Stop! We\\'re too big to fit in there.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander #2\\'\\'\\': No we\\'re not, watch this. You were right.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander\\'\\'\\': Next time listen to orders.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': Those tanks are too big to follow.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': See, see? Size is not everything. Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': Do you have any idea what the General was talkin\\' about?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rys\\'\\'\\': How should I know? There\\'s no figurin\\' a Jedi Master.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander\\'\\'\\': Infantry, advance. Go get \\'em boys.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': Sir, there are two patrols coming in on foot.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Now is the time to face the enemy lieutenant. Ambush them we will.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': We\\'ll flank them from the South.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': Right, let\\'s move.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid\\'\\'\\': What was that? Blast him! Look, little green life form. You bucket head, that\\'s the Jedi! He is a little one. Blast him! Split up by squad and spread out. Roger roger, roger roger.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': Okay clankers, SUCK LASER! Where\\'s the General?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t know, we got separated. Clankers! Fall back, there too many of them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid\\'\\'\\': He\\'s around here somewhere. Hey, get off of me! Don\\'t move. (Hologram) The Jedi destroyed our advance troops.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': Master Yoda is living up to my expectations.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Commander, have you pinpointed the Jedi\\'s location?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Affirmative. The clones gave away their position. Our heavy troops are moving to engage them now.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': I hope the General reaches the rendezvous point.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rys\\'\\'\\': This should buy him time. Lieutenant, can you walk?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': I think I\\'m okay.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Super Battle Droid\\'\\'\\': Die Republic dog!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': What are we gonna do sir?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': What\\'s the General doing?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rys\\'\\'\\': Keep blasting!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Super Battle Droid\\'\\'\\': Hey, what\\'s going on? Get out of the way, all of you! I\\'m having a serious malfunction! Don\\'t shoot! I\\'m on your side!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': You found us just in time sir.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Left behind, no one will be.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': Rollers, inbound.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Retreat! Cover you, I will.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Republic troops are injured, the Jedi is in full retreat Supreme Leader.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Good. Pursue them without delay.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': The contest is not over yet. Master Yoda, I hear you\\'re having trouble with the droid army?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Trouble? I know nothing of this trouble. Look forward to our meeting soon I do.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Look forward to our meeting soon I do. The Jedi won\\'t allude me for long.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': Are you sure we should go in there General?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': There\\'s no way out. Now rest, we must.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rys\\'\\'\\': We\\'re low on ammo sir. Only 2 grenades, and 1 rocket for the launcher.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': Against a battalion? Forget it, we\\'ve lost.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': So certain of defeat, are you?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': With respect General, maybe you should go on. Let us slow \\'em down.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': All around us, is that with which we need to prevail is. Come, sit. Your helmets, remove them. Your faces I wish to see.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': There\\'s not much to look at here sir. We all share the same face.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Deceive you, eyes can. In the force, very different each one of you are. Rys, always focuse on the enemy, are you. For inspiration, look to yourself, and those beside you. Jek, concerned about weapons you are. Weapons do not win battles. Your mind, powerful it is. Out think the droids, you can. Thire, rush not into fights, Long is the war, Only by surviving it, will you prevail. Yes. Clones you may be, but the force resides in all life forms. Use it you can, to quiet your mind.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rys\\'\\'\\': Tanks. Is that the best they can throw at us?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': Yeah, but I\\'ve only got one shot left.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Greet them I will.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': General, you don\\'t plan to take that whole column by yourself?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Have you three I do. Outnumbered are they. Know the time to help me, you will.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander\\'\\'\\': It\\'s the Jedi! Block his escape! Prepare to fire! (Hologram) Supreme Leader, we found the Jedi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Excellent. Where is he?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': He\\'s just sitting here, in front of our tanks.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Shoot him, shoot him now!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander\\'\\'\\': Quickly! Ready, Aim, Fire! Fire! He\\'s gone under the tank! Oh no! Run for it! But, I, just, got promoted.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': Doesn\\'t look like the General needs help to me.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid Commander #2\\'\\'\\': We\\'ve got him in our sights.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': That\\'s a lot of smoke, for a surrender.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': Report. What\\'s going on over there? Where is 224?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Battle Droid (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': Supreme Leader. The Jedi has overrun our position and--\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': I think perhaps all those stories about the Jedi are true.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': The fight isn\\'t over yet, Majesty.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': The General\\'s cutting \\'em up. We\\'ve got trouble. Clankers sent reenforcements. General\\'s too busy with that tank, he won\\'t see \\'em coming. I think I know how to deal with them.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Jek\\'\\'\\': Yeah! Great shot sir!\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': That\\'s givin\\' it to the clankers.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Learned something today, have you lieutenant?\\n*\\'\\'\\'Lieutenant Thire\\'\\'\\': I think we all did General.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Come, behind schedule are we. Not polite to be late.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': You were right, Dooku. One Jedi is not worth 100 battle droids. More like, 1,000. I\\'m sorry, but I will be joining the Republic.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Count Dooku\\'\\'\\': I urge you to reconsider wise king. I promise you won\\'t regret it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': Your agent also promised me Yoda would get a fair fight. I will not deal with those who break their words.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Count Dooku (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': So be it. Perhaps our negotiations will be more fruitful with your successor. Ventress, kill him!\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': Jedi Master Yoda. I am very pleased to meet you, at last.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Share the feeling, I do, King Katoonku. Failed you, Ventress has. Count.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Asajj Ventress\\'\\'\\': I don\\'t fear you Jedi.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Strong you are with the dark side young one. but not that strong. Still much to learn you have. Surrendur, you should. In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Count Dooku (Hologram)\\'\\'\\': It\\'s a pity I wasn\\'t there in person, my old master.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': A pity, indeed, my fallen apprentice. Perhaps now, begin negotiations we can.\\n*\\'\\'\\'King Katuunko\\'\\'\\': That is not necessary, my friend. You have my faith. Toydaria would be honored to host a Republic base. My people, are at your service.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Yoda\\'\\'\\': Your Majesty, fail you, we will not.\\n*\\'\\'\\'[End of Ambush]\\'\\'\\'\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'A Test of Strength': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'To Catch a Jedi': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Senate Spy': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, u'Holocron Heist': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Carnage of Krell': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Voyage of Temptation': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, u'Trespass': {'wikicontent': '==Trespass==\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Counter Attack': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Crisis at the Heart': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Eminence': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Weapons Factory': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'Friends and Enemies': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Wookiee Hunt': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Bounty': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, u'Brain Invaders': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n[[Category:Star Wars transcripts]]'}, 'The Wrong Jedi': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Last scene \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\nAnakin: Ahsoka wait! \\xc2\\xa0Ahsoka, I need to talk to you.\\n\\nAnakin: Why are you doing this?\\n\\nAhsoka: The Council didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trust me, so how can I trust myself?\\n\\nAnakin: What about me?

As separatist control over vital but isolated supply routes expands, Republic forces invade a key planet-- the darkened world of Umbara. In the midst of helping Obi-Wan Kenobi\\'s battalion conquer the Umbaran capital, Anakin Skywalker is called away to Coruscant. His battalion is temporarily placed under the command of Jedi General Pong Krell-- a shrewd and temperamental leader. Krell\\'s reckless strategy forced Captain Rex to retreat with his platoons in a disastrous defeat.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: We have got to move before those fighters come back.\\n\\nFives: Rex! Rex, over here!\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Jesse, take the right flank. Dogma, take the left flank.\\n\\nClone Trooper: You\\'re going to be okay, buddy. This will ease the pain.\\n\\nFives: Ugh!\\n\\nObi-Wan: The capital city\\'s too fortified. We need your battalion to help us take it.\\n\\nKrell: Resistance from the Umbarans has been greater than anticipated. We\\'re holding our ground at the moment.\\n\\nObi-Wan: We\\'ve gathered intel on an airbase to the West. It is resupplying the capital\\'s defenses.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Incoming! Incoming! Get down! Get down!\\n\\nObi-Wan: If you could capture that airbase, it will sever the capital\\'s supply lines, allowing the rest of our forces to move in. \\n\\nKrell: I\\'ll see to it that the airbase is placed under our control.\\n\\nObi-Wan: Remember, General Krell, the entire invasion depends on your battalion.\\n\\nKrell: Captain Rex, have those coordinates mapped and all troops ready to move out immediately.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Yes, General.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: There\\'s a base there, all right. And it\\'s heavily guarded. At least three tank divisions, plus guns.\\n\\nKrell: We\\'ll advance along the central gorge and engage their forces in a full-forward assault.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: The gorge is narrow, Sir. We\\'ll only be able to move our platoons in single squads. Perhaps a closer recon will tell us if there\\'s a more secure route.\\n\\nKrell: Obi-Wan and the other battalions are holding off the enemy right now while they wait for us to take out this base. We don\\'t have time to look for a more secure route.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Yes, Sir.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: All right, listen up. We\\'ll assemble the squads into two divisions. We\\'ll move straight up this gorge towards the airbase at the far side.\\n\\nClone Trooper: The casualties are going to be be high.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Is Krell trying to get us killed?\\n\\nClone Trooper: You know, I wasn\\'t sure that Krell was crazy before, but now I\\'m positive.\\n\\nFives: We had to retreat from the capital because the general pushed a flawed strategy. Now this?\\n\\nClone Trooper: I don\\'t know. Could be fun.\\n\\nDogma: Well, I for one agree with the general\\'s plan. We\\'re running out of time and this is the best option.\\n\\nJesse: No recon? No air support? We don\\'t know what we\\'re up against. They have weapons we\\'ve never seen before.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: A few of General Skywalker\\'s plans seemed reckless too, but they worked.\\n\\nFives: Yeah but General Skywalker is usually leading his men up in the front, not bringing up the rear like General Krell. A full forward assault would leave us too exposed. \\n\\nClone Trooper: We have to look at other options.\\n\\nClone Trooper: It\\'s going to be a meat grinder down there.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Fives... It would help if you\\'d ease their minds.\\n\\nFives: Oh, you mean coax them into following another one of Krell\\'s suicide missions? We lost a lot of men last time.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Krell may do things differently, but he is effective at getting them done. He\\'s a recognized war hero. \\n\\nFives: He may have had some victories, but have you seen his casualty numbers? More troopers have been killed under his command than anyone else.\\n\\nCaptain Rex; That\\'s the price of war, Fives. We\\'re soldiers. We have a duty to follow orders, and,  if we must, lay down our lives for victory.\\n\\nFives: Do you believe that? Or is that what you were engineered to think?\\n\\nCaptain Rex: I honor my code. That\\'s what I believe.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Is everyone clear on the plan? Hardcase?\\n\\nHardcase: Yes, Sir.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Fives? Are you clear?\\n\\nFives: Yeah.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: All right, get in your groups. Let\\'s move out.\\n\\nFives: Everybody stay alert. Fingers on the trigger.  \\n\\nClone Trooper: They look spooked. What the...\\n\\nClone Trooper: Oh, skrag.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Blast it!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Look out!\\n\\nFives: Its head is ray shielded. We need rocket launchers!\\n\\nFives: Mayday! Mayday! Rex, we need rocket launchers-- now!\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Get those rocket launchers down there. Move it, troopers!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Take it. Take it.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Thanks, buddy.\\n\\nClone Trooper: I got him.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Go! Go, go, go! Keep moving! Keep moving!\\n\\nCaptain Rex: That was close.\\n\\nHardcase: You got a point there.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Move it, trooper.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Everyone regroup, now! Take cover!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Move it! Move it!\\n\\nFives: We\\'re safe for the moment.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: They\\'ll be coming around any second. Bring up the launchers. Spread detonators along that corridor. Trap them into the bottleneck. We\\'re going to blow those things sky high. Hurry up. We only have a few seconds.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Here they come.\\n\\nClone Troopers: Hey! Come on! Over here! Right over here! Over here! Whoo!\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Ugh.\\n\\nClone Trooper: We got \\'em! We got \\'em!\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Good job. All right, let;s move out.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: That one\\'s still got some juice in it. Waste it!\\n\\nHardcase: Sure.\\n\\nClone Trooper: No juice left in him either.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Hey! Still hungry? Chew on that!\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Everyone, keep moving. Hey, Kix, leave it.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: We\\'ve got a problem. Fall back! Fall back now!\\n\\nKrell: What are they doing? Captain, continue your attack.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Sir, we\\'re overpowered. We need reinforcements.\\n\\nKrell: The rest of the battalion is holding the entrance to the gorge, Captain. They\\'re guarding it so your troops can break through to the airbase.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Sir, we can\\'t possibly...\\n\\nKrell: You must stand your ground. Do you read me? Captain? Are you listening? Do not fall back. That is an order!\\n\\nSergeant Appo: The platoons are in the formation you requested, General. Should I send them yo support Captain Rex?\\n\\nKrell: I\\'ll give the order when I give it, Sergeant Appo.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Keep the wounded as quiet as possible. All right, you heard the General. Let\\'s go.\\n\\nClone Trooper: You can\\'t be serious.\\n\\nFives: I used to think that General Krell was reckless, but now I\\'m beginning to think he just hates clones.\\n\\nDogma: The Captain is right. Now, let\\'s move out. \\n\\nFives: We can\\'t take them head on. We need to find another way.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: You got any ideas? Then this is it.\\n\\nHardcase: Okay. Let\\'s do it.\\n\\nClone Trooper: Ah!\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Watch your left!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Ah!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Rocket launchers don\\'t work on these things!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Oh!\\n\\nClone Troopers: Ah!\\n\\nKix: Help me with the wounded! We got to get these guys out of here.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Forget it. We have to leave them.\\n\\nKix: We can\\'t just leave them, Sir.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: You don\\'t have a choice. That\\'s an order.\\n\\nKix: You sound like General Krell.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Look, Kix, it\\'s more important to save yourself right now. If we survive, you can patch up the wounded later.\\n\\nClone Trooper: We\\'re... we\\'re finished.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: We\\'ve still got some fight left in us, Tup, and I\\'ve got an idea.\\n\\nFIves: What were you thinking?\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Remember what you were saying about finding another way to destroy those tanks?\\n\\nFives: Yeah.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Well, I have a mission for you.\\n\\nKrell: CT-7567, where are you?\\n\\nCaptain Rex: General Krell, we\\'ve come up with a plan to infiltrate the airbase. \\n\\nKrell: What is your plan?\\n\\nCaptain Rex: I\\'ve dispatched two men on a stealth incursion into the airbase. They\\'ve been ordered to co-opt starfighters and use them against the tanks.\\n\\nKrell: You what? You put this entire assault on your hope that two clones could do what your entire group could not? \\n\\nCaptain Rex: Sir, the rocket launchers don\\'t work on these tanks, and it\\'ll be easier to slip by undetected while the rest of us keep the tanks occupied. \\n\\nKrell: Captain, you will launch a full-forward strike immediately! Or you will be relieved of duty.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: We need to hold out as long as we can. I\\'m trusting Fives and Hardcase to pull this thing off.\\n\\nHardcase: The second they spot us, I start blastin\\'.\\n\\nFives: Hardcase, can\\'t you take it easy for once? Stick to the plan instead of guns blazing.\\n\\nHardcase: I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just how I am. My commander on Kamino said my growth acceleration chamber had a leak. Made me hyperactive, I guess.\\n\\nFives: Shh! There\\'s the airbase. Hmm. Some kind of sensor wall. Use the tree to get over the sensor wall.\\n\\nHardcase: Uh, how am I supposed to do this, exactly?\\n\\nFives: Figure it out.\\n\\nHardcase: \"Figure it out, Hardcase. Figure it out.\" What\\'s to figure out about climbing up a tree? How about you try it next time? Great. Nice view. I prefer a good fight to all this sneaking around.\\n\\nFives: Wow, I never actually thought that would work.\\n\\nFives: So how do I start this thing?\\n\\nHardcase: Well, how should I know? Start pushing buttons. Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ha ha! Glad these things are ray shielded.\\n\\nFives: Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho. Whoa! Oh!\\n\\nHardcase: I don\\'t think I can do this.\\n\\nFives: Ha! Watch out!\\n\\nHardcase: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\n\\nHardcase: Let\\'s hope this trip was worth it.\\n\\nFives: All right, let\\'s go!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Ah!\\n\\nClone Trooper: Hey, Kix, bring it down. You\\'re wasting heat.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: What the...\\n\\nFives: Clear out, Captain.\\n\\nHardcase: The big guns have arrived, Sir!\\n\\nFives: Yeah!\\n\\nHardcase: Take that! Whoo-hoo!\\n\\nFives: Yeah, whoo! That\\'s the stuff!\\n\\nClone Troopers: Way to go boys! Yeah! Atta boy, Hardcase! Whoo!\\n\\nFives: All right, let\\'s bring \\'em home.\\n\\nKrell: Impressive. Sergeant, their defenses are down. Send in the rest of our forces. Attack the airbase!\\n\\nSergeant Appo: All units move out.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: Despite Hardcase\\'s flying, you two saved us all.\\n\\nHardcase: That wasn\\'t so tough.\\n\\nFives: You sure? You looked a little green when you came out of that fighter.\\n\\nKrell: Captain, report. What is our situation?\\n\\nCaptain Rex: General, we have taken the base and cut off enemy supply lines to the capital.\\n\\nKrell: Luck has smiled on you today, Captain. Consider yourself fortunate.\\n\\nCaptain Rex: It wasn\\'t all luck, Sir. A lot of men died to take this base. \\n\\nKrell: The price for such victory. Perhaps someday you\\'ll realize this. Dismissed.\\n\\nFives: He\\'s the one who will never realize.'}, 'Witches of the Mist': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'The Unknown': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Orders': {'wikicontent': '\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}, 'Shades of Reason': {'wikicontent': '<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\'\\'\\'[incomplete & blank/empty]\\'\\'\\'</p>\\n{{Stub}}\\n[[Category:Star Wars: The Clone Wars Transcripts]]'}}})}}\n"
